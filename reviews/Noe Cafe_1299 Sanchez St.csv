Noe Cafe,Nice coffee and food options... They had run out of bagels when we got there due to it being busier than normal. Overall decent experience...  Will pop in again for a coffee when in that area.  Avo toast looked great... But tasted average...
Noe Cafe,"Very small but warm atmosphere. Limited menu but includes some unusual food and drink. Also sells a carefully curated small number of gifts. Large, clean rest room, warm, patient  friendly staff. Popular with folks working on laptops."
Noe Cafe,"Beautiful cafe on a street corner with outdoor seating and a variety of pastries and drinks.  There was a short line when I visited on a Wednesday afternoon. It appeared that the indoor seating was closed off. When it was my turn to order, I stepped to the counter and got a ""Fresh OJ"" and ""Everything Croissant"" which totaled just under $10. Paying was easy because they accept mobile payments and cards. The juice tasted fresh but was in quite a small cup for $4. Still, it was a reasonable serving. The croissant was super flaky and there was a good amount of everything seasoning on top. It was filled with a squiggle of cream cheese. Utensils, napkins, and that sort of thing were on a little table further inside. The walkway wasn't very wide, but a small wheelchair could squeeze through. Overall, it was a good experience, though pricier than I expected. But if you're going to a cafe, it's because you want to splurge a little and not make a drink for yourself."
Noe Cafe,"My mocha wasn't good - some artificial flavor that I don't really expect in this drink. The hotdogs are great, though. Exactly how I make them myself."
Noe Cafe,Fantastic trendy and very popular coffee shop in the heart of Noe Valley with a great selection of beverages (including wine!) and treats and lots of varied outdoor seating. I went on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.
Noe Cafe,"Would give it more stars if they'd just open up the indoor seating (they have it! They just won't let you sit on it!) Great baked goods selection, only slightly overpriced but generally on point. But if you're looking for a nice community spot, this wouldn't be it (unless it's not raining or isn't cold and the 4 seats under their canopy aren't all taken ...)"
Noe Cafe,Stopped here on a rainy morning. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Would come back! Had a really tasty Americano
Noe Cafe,"They make really good espresso drinks! The espresso is always properly pulled, no strange bitterness, and the milk is steamed well, nice small micro foam and not burning hot.  Decent pastries and breakfast sandwiches too!"
Noe Cafe,"We live around the corner, so this spot is super convenient for us. Their pastries are fantastic, coffee is pretty good too, but I’m not a coffee aficionado. We’ve usually had pretty good service here, but as others have commented, that can be hit or miss.  The main reason I took off a star is because their policy on dogs is bizarre. I usually tie my dog up outside, where they have nice hooks and dog bowls, but one day, I saw another person go inside with their dog (and not some teeny dog or service dog either, it was a big Bernese mountain dog with no harness) and saw the baristas talking excitedly to the dog and owner. I was next in line after this person, and when I tried to bring my dog in, I was told dogs aren’t allowed. I have absolutely no issue with dogs not being allowed in a café, in fact, I think that’s best practice. But it’s really frustrating as a customer to see special treatment given to friends of the staff or owner. And then today, my husband stopped in for a donut and said there were at least eight dogs running around the café.  The staff was so preoccupied with entertaining the dogs that he and another customer got sick of waiting and ended up leaving. My advice to the owner would be to have one consistent policy when it comes to dogs, preferably that they’re not allowed in the café ever for health code reasons, and stick to that, regardless of who comes to the door."
Noe Cafe,"Best avocado toast in town, amazing coffee and friendliest staff. Highly recommend!"
Noe Cafe,"Gave this place another chance this afternoon. On both occasions, the service at the counter left much to be desired - I had a small order (two drinks and a pastry) but the cashier’s standoffish and impatient attitude made me feel like I was wasting their time and extremely uncomfortable. Drinks and food were good but not enough to make me come back. Unfortunate since we live so close by."
Noe Cafe,"""Happy Hour"" means no coffee, but cocktails. We looked for a cafe open late that had a neighborhood vibe. This place definitely fits that bill but we didn't order anything since we were there to grab coffee, tea and cocoa to go but got there after happy hour began. Would love to visit next time we are in San Francisco. People were really nice and it felt so hip in there."
Noe Cafe,"Best coffee and surely one of the best coffee shops in SF! They have the loveliest pastries and really good bagels, and the drinks are fantastic! Vibe is great, especially with the outside seating. They don’t have wifi so keep that in mind when working from here. My fav spot in Noe 🧚‍♀️"
Noe Cafe,"bad vibes, v mid coffee (esp do not get the cold brew, it’s so bad) pic of the sludge at the bottom of our cold brew  side note, I wasn’t trying to work here but why have such nice booth space built if you’re never going to let anyone use it ??"
Noe Cafe,"Cute little cafe in Noe Valley. Had a nice decaf specialty latte with cinnamon and I really enjoyed it. They have all the milks, and looked like some good pastries although I didn’t partake. There was lots of outdoor seating in a quiet neighborhood. Great place to stop"
Noe Cafe,Visited on a Saturday morning for some coffee & pastries! The everything bagel croissant was very tasty and the lemon scone was my personal favorite!  Definitely recommend!
Noe Cafe,"Cutest little cafe in Noe Valley: winning combo WARM pastries and delicious beverages! Parking was pretty easy to find and there’s a cute parklet outside to drink coffee.  Today I ordered Cortado and Americano. Both were solid! The empanadas were amazing served warm. It is the best when cafe offers to warm up your pastries!  They partnered with many amazing local places for you to get delicious empanadas from Pampa BBQ, pastries from Kahnfections, Poppy Bagels!"
Noe Cafe,Esther - thank yo so much! you are the best. We so appreciate that! The oven really does make the pastries amazing😍
Noe Cafe,Great cappuccino. The baked goods looked AMAZING - will be back for those tomorrow 😋
Noe Cafe,Fresh coffee roasted on premises.  No indoor seating.  Very busy all the time. We'll made fresh pastry and barista style drinks.
Noe Cafe,"This is my favorite cafe EVER here in the city. I love their coffee, lattes, pastries, empanadas and most importantly the staff. I look forward to seeing all of them and we are all on a first name basis! One of the baristas Oscar introduced me to an Americano that I get either iced or hot with cream that is perfection. I even use their Guatemala coffee at home. They use local bakers and my favorite cookies I get weekly are the homemade animal cracker type cookies with sprinkles. Incredible!"
Noe Cafe,"Friendly nice cafe, lots of drink and food options. They serve wine and beer.  Currently no seating inside. They have a covered parklet but the wind gets through and a about half the seats are out of that anyhow, so it can be cold on windy days."
Noe Cafe,Super cute new coffee spot in Noe with lovely outdoor seating. Lots of yummy looking pastries and several are “gluten-free.” Decaf and oatmilk are also available.
Noe Cafe,Thank you for your kind review Rose. We really appreciate it! 🙌🙌
Noe Cafe,Our beloved local cafe! We probably go here 3-5x a week! Friendly staff and neighbors. The pastries are great! I personally love the sticky bun. The London fizz is also great. What’s not to love.
Noe Cafe,"Cute spot in the heart of Noe with good coffee, gluten free pastries (if you go in the morning), and non gluten free (but delicious according to my husband) empanadas in the afternoons. Good outdoor seating and it is on a slow street so you can actually sit and enjoy without traffic wizzing by!"
Noe Cafe,Lovely neighbor coffee shop. Also serves wine and beer! Great stop with the family.
Noe Cafe,"Totally average coffee shop severing a decent cup of coffee and pastries. Nice staff, clean but over priced.  Not bad in a pinch but there are better options very close by."
Noe Cafe,About as good as you can get. Very friendly staff who are always happy to give you their opinion on drinks/beans if you ask. Their coffee is downright amazing (cappuccinos FTW) and they sell a lot of interesting things there.
Noe Cafe,"I love the vibe, look, and everything about this cafe! Great for wfh work spot too! Will come back not only for this chocolate Nutella croissant of course!"
Noe Cafe,"👍Good coffee 😣 The pastries was not that good, pretty dry... And Kind of expensive …"
Noe Cafe,One of our favorite coffee shops in SF. The staff is amazing!
Noe Cafe,"LOVE Noe Cafe!!! Great coffee, great beer, and a great neighborhood meetup spot.  Every time I come there are people outside talking and enjoying the slow street. There are often food options in the evening too."
Noe Cafe,Nice coffee with a great atmosphere and friendly barista.
Noe Cafe,"All the guys here were very helpful and sweet. No snooty baristas here! I got a decaf Americano and a seasonal scone. Oh my. They were both *chefs kiss* perfection! My friend got a juice and a couple empanadas, and she loved hers as well. There was plenty of outside seating. For a first visit, we were both impressed. We'll definitely be back!"
Noe Cafe,I don’t understand why there are so many good comments out there!Based on this comment ppl decide to pay a visit to this place.Cappuccino tastes bad probably on of the worst i had in my life and they make you sit outside even in cold and rainy weathers
Noe Cafe,I love this cafe! It’s a half block from my house and I go there all the time for coffee and pastries. They have a great canned beer selection if you want to grab a single beer. Great atmosphere for hanging out as well!
Noe Cafe,Stylish & buzzing cafe in Noe Valley. Great place to meet up with friends for an easy brunch & catch some rays on a sunny day.
Noe Cafe,Terrible drinks. Hours are wrong. Unusably slow wifi. They made us sit outside in the rain even though there were empty tables inside. Someone yelling loudly inside. Worst cafe I've ever been to.
Noe Cafe,Cute family-owned cafe with convenient seating and a relaxed vibe right along the pleasant Sanchez slow street project. Great coffee and a good selection of pastries; it's a welcome respite from the normal busy and noisy city street cafes whether you want to wake up with caffeine or wind down with wine or beer.
Noe Cafe,"Great location, nice place. Ordered Americano and it wasn’t hot. Almond croissant was old today. Tasted like croissant that was on the shelf already second day. And they can’t warm up pastry here."
Noe Cafe,Perfect little coffee shop in Noe Valley away from the main strip. Unfortunately it’s right by a slightly busy intersection but the neighborhood vibe makes up for it. Good food selection too! Try the empanadas!Great pop-up food a few days a week makes for a serendipitous delight.
Noe Cafe,"Update, this place is now very well established and a real great place we go to constantly. The taco Thursday is awesome, but the baked goods and sandwiches are also a highlight.  They are consistently changing and fantastic. Unlike at some big chains I won't mention, these are always better than I expected. ---- Great new shop, which is just opening during Covid but safely and with outdoor seating and take away. Can't wait to be able to sit indoors, but the slow street makes this a fun experience even in our current circumstances of social distancing."
Noe Cafe,"The perfect neighborhood roastery cafe. Bright and sunny, solid drinks."
Noe Cafe,"Picturesque spot in the city, good drinks. No indoor seating."
Noe Cafe,The baristas are super nice and it was a fun atmosphere for working outside. There are a lot of (outdoor only) seats for a small place and even though it was busy I didn’t have to wait for a table. Wifi was good. Drinks are on the pricey side but they have some beer and wine (I got an aperol spritz to get me through the end of some work on a Friday) and it’s worthwhile to enjoy a nice spot on a sunny day.
Noe Cafe,"Trying a different cafe in downtown SF each time we’re downtown. Today it was Noe Cafe.  was the warmest day of the year so far - it was nice to have found a cafe with some outdoor seating so we could soak up the warm sunshine. There’s a queue spilling out of the cafe. It’s around 1pm in the afternoon. We get in line. Everyone in our group wants an iced drink. We get to the counter and they don’t have any ice. Nobody in the cafe seems to be interested in getting any ice. We ordered some hot drinks, the rest of the line of people left."
Noe Cafe,"This is a popular neighborhood spot on a slow street. Line up to order delicious pastries and light sandwiches with coffees. Then find seating outside to enjoy your repast. . We ordered empanadas, avocado toast, and cortados. The wait was not too long for either food or coffee. It was worth it, because the food was excellent. I especially liked the avocado toast with the sliced pickled onion (I guess?). . The line can get long, so pack your patience."
Noe Cafe,"So friendly, and they have gluten free baked goods!"
Noe Cafe,"Yifat, Thank you so much!"
Noe Cafe,"It wasn't bad... The staff there was extremely friendly...  Stars were removed for the lack of variation in drink sizes and price... Essentially you pay $5 and up for a small drink... I got a 8 or 16oz iced latte for like $5.75, but where I normally get a large iced for a little less...  All in all, it was a good taste... I won't go back to spend my own money, but I would allow others to get me a coffee or something from there..."
Noe Cafe,Fun Saturday afternoon sitting with neighbors having one's choice of coffee and sweets. There was wine tasting and some BBQ today too so no excuses for us not to stay for hours and continue chatting...
Noe Cafe,Came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was a great place to just sit and work! I really liked being able to sit In the covered outdoor seating and it wasn’t too too busy so we weren’t disturbed there. They have a good matcha latte cold and I like the ambiance with all of the green plant life. Would come again to work!
Noe Cafe,"Super cute corner coffee shop and the coffee, snacks and service are even better! I got some sort of chocolate chip cookie that was in my top 5 for best cookie ever. They’ve got a nice little parklet outside with seating on what is currently a “local traffic only” partial walk street. If I lived in this neighborhood it would be my daily."
Noe Cafe,"Update: had to lower to 4 stars. Empanadas and tacos on Thursdays are awesome, and it’s the best coffee shop in the neighborhood, but the coffee quality varies wildly between baristas. Can easily be very good or terrible depending on who’s at the coffee machine at any given moment."
Noe Cafe,Thanks Victor! 👊
Noe Cafe,Super cute cafe with great vibes and good coffee :)
Noe Cafe,"Great matcha latte. I love this cafe and especially their outdoor parklet that perfectly compliments Sanchez Slow Street and makes for a very inviting space to hang out. In fact, it seems to have become the central focus of Sanchez Slow street. A limited selection of baked goods but of high quality. Also serve alcohol. Overall, a well-needed addition to the neighborhood which injects some fresh energy into a neighborhood which otherwise has mostly dated/stale cafes that haven't been refreshed, both in terms of the quality of their food/drink and their ambiance, since the 90s."
Noe Cafe,- this place has great vibes and even better service - above average drinks too; got the flat white and iced latte
Noe Cafe,"Some of the best coffee and a great atmosphere.  Their Dolores Blend is one of the best coffee beans I've ever had.  Top micro roaster. Reasonable prices, friendly and smart service and Noe Valley Atmosphere!"
Noe Cafe,So friendly. This coin-op laundry has been turned into one of the best coffee shops in San Francisco. Great variety of baked goods sandwiches and salads. Don't miss the top-notch coffee served by the friendliest baristas around. Go today.
Noe Cafe,Thank you for your kind review James! We really appreciate it!!
Noe Cafe,Cute place and loved the empanadas
Noe Cafe,"I walked five blocks through the pouring rain to find a coffee shop where I could get some work done. Soaked head to toe, I finally arrive and I'm greeted warmly by the batista. However, after placing my order, I attempt to sit down at a booth when the owner hits me with, ""What are you doing?!? Indoor seating is for family only!"" As if I should have known better!  Put up a sign, or say something before your customer places their order. I ended up eating my pastry outside under a shelter while they looked on from inside. The whole experience was really disappointing."
Noe Cafe,My go to local coffee shop. Mary and the whole staff are wonderful. The renovation turned out beautiful (can't wait to eat inside) and the new outdoor seating is great. Pastries are delicious and of course the coffee is the best. It's places like these that make a neighborhood.
Noe Cafe,Marvin - Thanks for all your support over the years! 👊
Noe Cafe,great little neighborhood spot with large parklet on a slow street
Noe Cafe,"Awesome little cafe with a great vibe. Had empanadas, some other little snacks, and an Aperol Spritz. Coffee in the morning, beer and wine in the afternoon. Lots of families around with their puppies and their children."
Noe Cafe,One of the lovely cafes of Noe.  It's these little gems that make the neighborhood what it is.
Noe Cafe,Lovely local institution. Pleasantly quiet safe street with indoor and outdoor seating.
Noe Cafe,"I've gotten an oat milk latte which was great, but I got just a black coffee this time and it was fantastic! Lots of patio seating outside and is dog friendly. Haven't tried their pastries but they look amazing"
Noe Cafe,"Katie, Thanks for your awesome review! We really appreciate it."
Noe Cafe,"Back in my home city briefly for the holidays😍...could not wait to visit my old neighborhood and have my favorite coffee and/or matcha made with love and such chosen quality by Maricar (the owner) who sprinkled her magic onto this local popular sunny Noe Valley corner spot.✨  Although, I missed her this time, I noticed she offered more carefully curated selections to the menu, plus Happy Hour 🍾Fri./Sat.: an assortment of simple quality local handcrafted sweet and savory favorites that only a foodie would fall in love-and even a health connoisseur would appreciate.  *Maricar has the networking sources and she hooked this place up with only the BEST!🤤  After actually living next door to her at one time, I know first hand her attention to detail and cultivated experience with all things food and drink shows in everything she does...this is no exception. *Fresh, simple quality, laid back, warm fun vibe. *Dog-friendly and parklet patio"
Noe Cafe,"Great coffee and pastries, but be careful to steer clear of the vegan and gluten free baked goods which LOOK amazing."
Noe Cafe,"Highly recommend for a outing in the neighborhood. Great staff, tasty almond croissant with a standard roast that will get you going anytime of the day. One star off for not having an option to heat pastries. Highly recommend for a outing in the neighborhood."
Noe Cafe,Thank you so much Penny! We are working on the option to heat up in the pastries. Please stay tuned! Thank you again❤️
Noe Cafe,Lovely neighborhood cafe with a whole lot of outdoor seating. The baked goods and heartier options are fantastic.
Noe Cafe,"The new orleans iced coffee was amazing, the barista was so friendly and convinced us to try it! Definitely would recommend and would be coming back. Also adorable outdoor dining atmosphere with a bubble machine."
Noe Cafe,Amazing cafe to hang out or work at their outdoor seating. Delicious food and drinks.
Noe Cafe,"They charge music festival prices, but they aren't posted. We were shocked when a beer, served in a plastic cup, was $10. Would not recommend. Many better options in the area."
Noe Cafe,I prob have tried every pastry there with my delicious cappuccino. Love how they partner with so many bakeries to bring the best of SF carbs to go with their awesome coffee and friendly vibes
Noe Cafe,Lovely neighborhood cafe. Flat white I had was just perfect. Ran out of food items/pastries but coffee itself tasted great. My daughter loved her hot chocolate and my wife loved her cappuccino.
Noe Cafe,"Great service and coffee, and a beautiful spot to hang out on the Slow Street of Sanchez while enjoying coffee and a pastry."
Noe Cafe,"Cafe Noe is a neighborhood gem! The coffee is fantastic. The staff are friendly and accommodating. The Almond Milk Lattes and Americanos are my favorites. Cafe Noe is well designed with a modern and clean esthetic. I especially like the wide sidewalk out front where friends / neighbors can gather, chat, and socially distance (tis the season)!"
Noe Cafe,Thank you so much for your kind review Sonia! We really appreciate it and love to see you in the café!! We will have a almond milk latte waiting for you! 🥰🥰
Noe Cafe,"There is magic going on at this new cafe.  Jamie, Thomas, Vida are really good people.  The humita vegan empenada (with green and red sauce), heated up and the incredible carrot cake locally made are my two favorite menu items.  The cafe is on a ""slow street"", which means you get to see neighbors walk and bicycle here, with their dogs and kids.  The co-owner Maricar's story about getting this old laundromat and turning it into this wonderful cafe (also on sf.eater.com)  is fantastic."
Noe Cafe,Thanks so much Jason! The whole team really appreciates it.
Noe Cafe,Beautiful new storefront in a quaint part of Noe Valley.  I've been buying their beans for months now and they're delicious! Try the Ethiopia.  Excited for the beer debut in the coming months.
Noe Cafe,Thanks Kunal! The Ethiopia is one of our favorites as well. So glad you like it! Thanks again for your kind review.
Noe Cafe,Great coffee and delicious pastries.  They have great sandwiches for lunches well.  Every Thursday they have tacos which are delicious!
Noe Cafe,This is one of the best cafés in the city! All of the workers are very friendly and their cappuccinos and donuts are awesome.
Noe Cafe,"Coffee was great and the staff friendly. I had a flat white.  $1 surcharge for oat milk is a bit steep, though."
Noe Cafe,"Beautiful cafe, great coffee, tempting pastries, and friendly owners! I am currently working through all the croissant options. Welcome addition to our Upper Noe neighborhood!"
Noe Cafe,"Jen - Thanks so much for coming in! We've just added a couple new croissant options, so come check them out! 🙌"
Noe Cafe,"Busy little neighborhood Cafe. All the outside seating was taken, including 3 large tables that were occupied by single people with laptops! 🙄 Couldn't find a garbage/recycle bin outside amongst all the seating?"
Noe Cafe,"Hands down my favourite cafe in Noe valley. Been here dozens of times. Quality very consistent, products very fresh. Staff very friendly. Recommend coming later in the day in weekend for kosher Hotdog omnomnom"
Noe Cafe,Great coffee with friendly staff and delicious pastries. Nice outdoor seating area too!
Noe Cafe,Changing my mind from 1 (too often they forget about my coffee) to 4 (now they have my favorite biscuits and they are delicious)! Inconsistency of coffee quality is still present. Thank you for being a gem of Slow Sanchez!
Noe Cafe,"Cute little corner cafe. Coffee is good and so are the pastries. Can have quite a bit of kids and strollers, but lots of outdoor seating."
Noe Cafe,New spot in Noe Valley. They have a huge selections of croissants and pastries. They look and they are amazing. And the cappuccino was very good too (approved by Italians :) )

Noe Cafe,Thanks Pablo! Always great to see you.
Noe Cafe,Best coffee (espresso based) in Noe Valley. Meets my Seattle bar. 😊 Nice selection of pastries as well and super friendly staff. …
Noe Cafe,"Iris, thank you so much! This really means a lot to us. We strive for an amazing espresso 🙏🏻"
Noe Cafe,"lovely neighborhood cafe and gathering place, the coffee is lovely too!"
Noe Cafe,Raised prices to where only rich white families can afford it and it's obvious from the clientele. Also the best baked goods there are from Kahnfections so just go there to avoid that markup.
Noe Cafe,Thanks for your great review Henry! We really appreciate it!
Noe Cafe,Btw there is a photo on here that shows indoor seating. I just called and they have never had indoor seating the guy says. So if you want indoors and WFH on laptop then that photo is wrong just an FYI.
Noe Cafe,Once you walk out with a coffee in hand your other hand is suddenly holding a leash with a French Bulldog and you have 95 more followers on Instagram. Nice.
Noe Cafe,Neighborhood favorite! Everything here is DELICIOUS. My partner and I are big fans of the new breakfast empanadas - those will keep us coming :)
Noe Cafe,Thank you fr your kind review Carol! It really means a lot! The empanadas are amazing 🔥!
