Tarragon Cafe,"Today i visited this cafe for the first time and i absolutely LOVED it ! I randomly drove by it while looking for a cafe to stop and hang out with my kids while waiting for my husband to get off work. The staff members are super nice, the place is really cute and hip, their coffee and pastries that i ordered were amazing, the whole place is neat and clean , with lots of seating.  They have a large variety of menu options. It’s located in a cute area of San Francisco. The vibe there is great and the music they played was just a cherry on top (jazz). I can’t wait to come back here again and again! The only thing i would suggest is maybe adding a changing table in the restroom, i came with my baby and wished they had a place for me to change the baby. Oh also maybe add a little kids corner or books at least or color pages and crayons to keep my kids busy so i can sip my coffee in peace 🙈😅"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your kind review and wonderful suggestions. We will definitely work on getting kids books and coloring supplies. We will also try to think of an option for a small changing table. We appreciate you and can’t wait to see you again soon! 
Tarragon Cafe,"Hands down Tarragon is the best spot in the Lower Haight. Breakfast, lunch, and (on Fri/Sat) dinner — and it’s all incredible. Highly recommend the Italian panini and Taco Friday!"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your five star review Cameron! The pictures you posted are also so helpful. Taco Friday seems to be a hit! We appreciate you! 
Tarragon Cafe,"My favorite Café in the city. The food is exquisite and is prepared by the Chef owner Mario whose passion for cooking is demonstrated by all the wonderful offerings. The margarita pizza is a hidden gem with its crispy thin crust and delicious homemade sauce is truly addictive. The salmon toast is probably the best I have ever had with its homemade tzatziki sauce. The atmosphere of the cafe is so friendly and welcoming.  I came back and had the salmon toast and it was so delicious. I also tried the various soups of the day, a Thai coconut vegetarian soup with kale and garbanzos and a potato kale soup were exquisite. It is worth coming here for the soup alone. The frittatas are the best I have ever had; I could eat them everyday.  The newest additions to the menu are amazing. One of favorites is the croissant bread pudding. It is glorious."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you David. We are happy to be your favorite cafe in the city! See you again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"SOLID 5 out of 5! My favorite dish was pork belly banh mi. Trust me, this is THE best banh mi that I have ever had in my life. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the pork was cooked beautifully (sous vide)! Cilantro did a really great job at bringing out the flavor of pork meat as well. Clam chouder soup is really creamy and flavorful, which was just perfect to warm up my body in the morning on a rainy day. The granola farfait was also great. The fruits were sweet and fresh! My fiancé and I finished all the dishes because they were so good and no, we don’t regret spending $70+ (incl. 3 cups of coffee and tips) at this place. I would definitely come to this place again if I ever get to have a chance to visit SF in the future!"
Tarragon Cafe,We’re so glad you both enjoyed yourselves and thank you for visiting! We hope to see you in the future and thank you for your beautiful pictures.
Tarragon Cafe,"Awesome place for breakfast, so good that I came back almost every morning. The breakfast Sando is really great, filling and with plenty of savors. The team is nice, and I felt welcomed every day."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your review! We hope to see you soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"The cafe sits under a gorgeous yellow house with green lining ; the sun finds its way to light up the spacious interior and sets it up for conviviality between friends and neighbors, strangers and passersby; comfortable chairs;  beautifully stenciled menu;  the vegetarian frittata has layers of texture and depth. Instead of being jam packed on a street with many other business , it is more an organic part of a  neighborhood."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your wonderful  review Krishin! We love to be the neighborhood spot. Can’t wait to see you soon
Tarragon Cafe,"Lovely staff and amazing food.  We had avocado toast, breakfast sando and croissant bread pudding….. I can’t rave enough about chef Mario’s food….. DELICIOUS!!!!  We stopped in every morning on our way to explore San Francisco.  I’m going to miss that breakfast sando.  Great location in lower Haight…hope to visit again one day.  Thank you for enriching our San Fran experience."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your awesome review Kristine! We are so happy to enrich your San Fran experience! We hope to see you again some day on your next trip. 
Tarragon Cafe,"So good I went there twice in two days! I’d been long overdue to check out Tarragon since I only live a block away—but I’m so glad I did. This is a lovely spot for breakfast and lunch, and they even play live music on some weekends. This is the type of food that you can tell is made with great care: the owner himself is in the kitchen putting your food together. My first visit I tried the chicken panini, which was delicious, and the next morning I went for the ham breakfast sandwich, which was even better. Ingredients are high quality, the bread is great, the vibes are cozy, local and welcoming—and it sits on a great corner for sitting outside in the sunlight. Next time I think I’ll try the carrot cake!"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your kind review! We are looking forward to seeing you again soon. Glad we are neighbors!
Tarragon Cafe,"Best staff ever  - in our few days visiting they helped guide us to some great spots and we were in a first name basis!  Food is delicious, go for eggs special or frittata or the danishes!  Feels like you’re getting breakfast in your own home (but you’re not making or cleaning).  Decorated great too!  Can’t say enough great things about this place."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Jenny! Mario and Thomas loved getting to know you and your family while you were visiting. We hope to see you all again sometime soon.
Tarragon Cafe,"Mario is an absolute master in the kitchen, and a very kind owner. We ate too quick to snap a picture but holy heck is the food here amazing. Will definitely make this my new neighborhood lunch spot."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your review Sophia! Can’t wait to see you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,Had a breakfast sandwich with fruit and a coffee. The food was delicious and coffee was good as well. They have some tables to sit outside or plenty of seating inside. They have wifi but make sure to bring your devices fully charged as I didn't see an outlet to use. Will definitely be back!
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your review Krissy! We appreciate you and can’t wait to serve you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,super great local spot that opened up recently. staff was extremely friendly and food was very yummy! pretty comprable prices with other spots but you get two meals worth of food. look at that ginormous beautiful salad!!
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your excellent review and picture Chiara! We appreciate you and thanks for supporting small businesses! Can’t wait to see you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,Beautiful space inside and out! Salmon toast was delicious. Will definitely come back for brunch/lunch!
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your review Joshua! We can’t wait to see you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,"My favorite lunch spot in the area - the salads are huge, fresh and incredibly tasty! Nice servers and a pleasant, well-lit atmosphere that makes for a great work/study spot"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your review Angeline! We appreciate you and hope to see you again soon! 
Tarragon Cafe,"What a lovely place! Found spontaneously. Friendly people, very clean, nice ambiente and the most important: a really good coffee, strong dark roasted. Totally recommended!"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Leander! We appreciate you and can’t wait to see you again
Tarragon Cafe,One of my regular spots to get a coffee and sit outside. Their ham and cheese croissants are probably the best ones I've had in the area since they toast it to perfection 🤤
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Nao! We appreciate you! See you soon! 
Tarragon Cafe,"Spacious coffee shop with modern vibe, good food options, and friendly staff. I ordered fritatta and it was meticulously prepared, delicious beyond your usual cafe fare.  A good place to work - solid wifi, plenty of comfortable seating (indoor and outdoor). Long opening hours."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your review Jan! See you soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"Definitely wouldn't be going back. Atmosphere is good, the cashier was polite/ professional, but that's where it stops. Food took forever-r-r and the Cuban, I could have made at home."
Tarragon Cafe,Sorry it took so long for your order. Our kitchen is very small and we get backed up sometimes.
Tarragon Cafe,"I love this place! Great place to work or have lunch. I usually get a salad - they’re HUGE, fresh, and super delicious. I mean seriously. Look at it."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for the awesome review and the picture Tamara! Can’t wait to see you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,Owner is clearly super passionate and knowledgeable. The potato leek soup is other wordly. If I can give this place 100 stars I would.  TRY THE SOUP!
Tarragon Cafe,"Thank you, so much Brian. Mario loves what he does and loves it when his customers love it too! Can’t wait to see you soon."
Tarragon Cafe,"One of the best coffeeshops I came across in San Francisco. Very hospitable barristers. Crafted coffee and a selection of American and German beers. I asked about Belgian beer and they took note of it. Nice outdoor seating. The sun is beautiful in the winter here. Cute neighborhood. I got a beer and they brought me some popcorns to ""munch"" on."
Tarragon Cafe,"Hello Javed, we will have your Chimay in a week or two! Looking forward to seeing you soon."
Tarragon Cafe,"As much as I want to keep this place our little secret, I would rather give this incredible spot the praise it deserves. My husband and I love this spot! We are foodies that love finding new and tasty restaurants. Unfortunately we found Tarragon Cafe right before we moved out of SF, but whenever we have a chance to go back, we do. The service, the food (taste and presentation), and the portion size are all fantastic. We always leave happy and satisfied."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your wonderful review Nicole! Can’t wait to see you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,Great breakfast and coffee spot! The breakfast sando is bomb and I’m obsessed with the side salad they serve with it.
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Martin! We appreciate you and your 5 star review! Hope to see you again soon! 
Tarragon Cafe,"Love this spot! Super fresh brunch, friendly service, and delicate champagne glasses. A treat for the city girls. Sit outside!"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your awesome review Annalise! Love the pictures!
Tarragon Cafe,Awesome. Great cesar salad with amazing homemade dressing. Also the best gluten free panini ever!
Tarragon Cafe,"Beware, if you're planning on coming in here with a service animal, you might be in for a rude awakening.  After reading all of the positive Yelp reviews, I was excited to give Tarragon Cafe a try. I came in this Sunday afternoon with my wife and her service dog, and we ordered an iced latte and bottled water to go. We paid and tipped generously.  As I was walking out the door, one of the staff members commented loudly to another employee about my wife bringing in her service animal. Something to the effect of my wife thinking she ""could bring her dog anywhere.""  I went back inside and asked to speak to a manager. I was shocked to learn that the rude comment had come directly from the mouth of one of the owners. I said, ""may I share with you how I'm feeling after that experience?"" He refused to even come to the counter to hear my grievance, insisting we discuss it very publicly from 10 feet away (he was in the kitchen area).  I explained that, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, my wife is legally permitted to bring her service animal with her into establishments like this, and that the owner's comment felt rude and discriminatory.  The owner replied in an argumentative manner, saying that he knew there are ""two types"" (I assume this meant ESA vs. support animal?) and seemed to be implying that we didn't actually have the right to be here.  I calmly replied that we had come in with a service animal, not an emotional support animal. I told him he could've simply asked if the dog were a service animal, and even asked what tasks they're trained to do, but the way that he had so openly and rudely commented as my wife and I exited the cafe was incredibly wrong.  The owner finally apologized but did nothing else to remedy the situation. In effect, I paid $7 to be verbally insulted and then condescended to. My wife and I were planning to sit outside in the outdoor seating area for a while, but after this exchange, neither of us felt comfortable staying. We ended up walking down the street to another cafe.  I truly hope management considers the way they're treating paying patrons, even when they think those patrons are out of ear's reach. It's very telling when a merchant is willing to take your money one second, then insult you the next.  Not that it matters in the grand scheme, as it would take a lot for me to give this place another try, but the iced latte wasn't something I'd order twice."
Tarragon Cafe,Salmon toast and avocado toast with salad were excellent! The ingredients were high quality and dressed well. We really enjoyed our breakfasts
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your review R B! Can’t wait to see you again
Tarragon Cafe,"Came upon this restaurant on our way to see the painted ladies. It looked so nice and inviting with the doors open and people sitting inside and outside. We ordered the Caprese sandwich. Fresh mozzarella, pesto, (which is made fresh in house) and tomato all on a yummy fresh baguette. The owner was very friendly and after making the sandwiches went around and talked to all his customers. Really made us feel like family. All the employees we smiling and talking to the customers as well. Definitely could have pulled out my laptop and sat around all day."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Tidewatergirl! Glad you liked it and can’t wait to see you again!
Tarragon Cafe,We live a couple blocks away and enjoy coming here a couple times a week for breakfast and coffee. I always get their pork belly banh mi sand which and lemon poppyseed muffin!
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your review Trini! We appreciate you and can’t wait to see you again 
Tarragon Cafe,"Great sandwiches, and lovely people! We had the sous vide pork belly bahn mi, and the vegetarian panini. Both really fantastic, the pork belly especially! The veggie panini has a diverse mix of vegetables, including mushrooms, beets, and eggplant. Looking forward to sitting out front again for future breakfast sandwiches!"
Tarragon Cafe,"Can’t wait to see you again soon, Sarah! Thank you for your 5 star review."
Tarragon Cafe,"Nice quiet place in a peaceful neighborhood. The coffee, sandwiches and dishes were well prepared and tasty. Seating available indoors as well as on the sidewalk. A nice pleasant experience"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your review Mangal. We appreciate you.
Tarragon Cafe,"I went in for the first time, nice cafe vibes. Ordered a veggie panini and - quite reasonably, since it was 4pm - they had run out of the focaccia bread the veggie panini comes on. The problem? Nobody figured it was worth mentioning this detail until the panini came out and i asked why it wasn’t on focaccia. To be fair, the panini had good ingredients and preparation but the flavors just entirely clashed with the bitter substitute bread. I undoubtedly would have chosen a different bread if given the option.  Open to going again since i want to like the place, but it’s kind of a crucial oversight to not mention they’re out of one of the main ingredients, let alone the option to chose which replacement bread. Definitely would not have chosen the replacement bread they chose for me."
Tarragon Cafe,"Hello Neel, Sorry for your experience. We have discussed this with the staff and we will try to have them let people know before serving your food or better yet, at the register."
Tarragon Cafe,"A place that offers paninis and actually serves paninis sold me from the get go. The ample sunlight for the entirety of midday makes the curb seating divine. Mario, the chef, has achieved his passion project and it resonates in every facet. Thomas’s bright clothes and smile set the perfect tone for a relaxing cafe visit. I haven't even smelled a bad vibe walking by. Highly recommend slowing down for an hour and enjoying this beautiful corner of the world.  But not all of you all at once! I'd like them to crush it financially so they can stay around for years, but also I like having a place to sit outside.  Your move, world.  EDIT: okay, was being funny before about the “all at once,” but I just tried the bahn mi and all bets are off. World, on top of everything else I said that holds true, y’all need to get down here and try that sandwich. That was THE best sandwich I’ve ever had. Definitely a bit of a treat, but a treat anyone would be glad to spend the calories on. Do it."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Graham for taking the time to write this wonderful review. Hope to see you again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,I happened here on my way to Choux bakery! What a gem! This NJ girl was excited to try the pizza along with an IPA on a hungry afternoon. It was amazing! The dough sauce and cheese all came together for the perfect sweet salty chewy and warm flavors!
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your kind review Christina! Glad you came by and can’t wait to see you again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"Searching for places to eat in the local area and this place popped up. I don’t normally leave reviews, but I feel compelled as the food was exquisite and the chef very friendly. Can’t wait to return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to eat in San Francisco."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much for your kind review Jean! We are looking forward to serving you again soon.
Tarragon Cafe,"Great friendly service, good selection of delicious food.  Beer and wine."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Steve! Can’t wait to see you again
Tarragon Cafe,"Great coffee, even better service. The friendliest cafe in the city!!"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for naming us the friendliest cafe in the city Neal! Hope to see you soon!
Tarragon Cafe,Amazing food and setting.  The chef / owner is a master in the kitchen.  The salad is one of the best I have had in a long time.  We had a delicious pepperoni and capicola pizza and a Niçoise salad.
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your wonderful review MaryAnn! Can’t wait to serve you again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"Super friendly people, amazing food. Chinese chicken salad is loaded with fresh flavors and sous vide chicken. Paninis are loaded. A favorite lunch time spot in the neighborhood"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Tyler for your kind review! We appreciate you and can’t wait to see you again soon
Tarragon Cafe,"Great Cappuccino, yummy food, super friendly staff. Thanks to Mario, the owner, for adding so much to the neighborhood. Wait, there is more: Comfortable, SUNNY sidewalk seating. Feels like Southern France - or Italy: La Dolce Vita - Life is sweeter because of Tarragon Cafe :)"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you so much Dietmar! We have a special little spot here and love the neighborhood and wonderful people like you. Can’t wait to see you again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"We love this place. Perfect mix of friendly, clean, casual atmosphere and swift service. We had the nicoise, beef panini, chicken panini and the caprese. All delicious and the right balance of filling to bread. The staff are great and Mario, the owner, is the nicest guy. We'll be going back soon to try some more of this fine fare."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Mark! Looking forward to seeing you all again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,Delicious croissants!! Will return for the salads
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your great review Abe! Can’t wait to see you again
Tarragon Cafe,"Most of us were so sad to see the departure of Cafe du Soleil, and I was wary of trying the new place, but, damn, the food is great!  The friendly chef/owner even came out and intor'd himself on my first visit and we talked about food, of course, and I could tell he knew his way around a restaurant kitchen.  And he does. Off a compact, well designed menu, my go-to is the Asian Chicken salad, a dish that I usually avoid as it so often is too sweet or has an acrid-tasting dressing, but at Tarragon, it sings.  It's just delicious and big enough for2, or 3.  Sandwiches are served on breads that taste like what they're made from, and they're ample and delicious, a bit unusual without being contrived. So I'm a fan of Tarragon.  And Cafe du Soleil is making a comeback in the former Thep Phenom space. More on that later."
Tarragon Cafe,"Thank you Rob! Mario makes all of his dressings, aioli, pesto, soups, and pizza dough, from scratch. He puts a lot of love into his food and works really hard. It all becomes worth it when people like you appreciate his food. Thank you for trying us and we hope to see you again soon."
Tarragon Cafe,"UPDATED review: They've really improved things! After coming here several times over the last year or so, it's gotten cuter + better pastries + nicer menu. The payment system ""reach up on your toes because the cord is too short"" still bothers me...  OLD review: I was excited for a new local cafe, but it was just ""okay"". The coffee tasted like it was from a hotel, pastries were dry, and their payment system was not pandemic friendly even though they built their new restaurant DURING the pandemic (lots of back and forth credit card handling/signing the screen with finger). It all felt a little inattentive/carelessly planned. Staff was friendly, at least."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for trying us again Kevin! We’re Slowly working on making things better. Our payment system isn’t the best but we’re stuck with it for now.  Hope to see you soon.
Tarragon Cafe,"Lovely staff, ambience, menu and prices. We showed our vaccination certificate and sat inside. Enjoyed our clam chowder, Chinese salad, and sandwiches. In our list of go-to places when in San Francisco."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your kind review Rishi. Hope yo see you all again soon!
Tarragon Cafe,"I had the Vegetarian Panini sandwich for lunch today. It was amazing! Fresh eggplant, beets, portobello mushrooms and other veggies all cooked to perfection- not to mention the fresh pesto sauce, which was wonderful. I will be coming back often and I’m looking forward to trying their Caprese Sandwich next time.! This lovely corner restaurant is a terrific addition to the neighborhood!"
Tarragon Cafe,The food was OK and the coffee was fine. But when the television went on and the commercials started blaring I had to get up and leave. I’m wondering why an otherwise peaceful coffee shop needs to have a television especially one that has a long series of commercials. I found it very annoying.
Tarragon Cafe,Sorry for your experience Graham. The Tv is usually on music mode.
Tarragon Cafe,Breakfast sandwich and side salad are awesome.  I look forward to trying more of their menu.  They are a new restaurant with new staff and have been doing a great job.   It's also great that they have outdoor seating.
Tarragon Cafe,"Great owner, fantastic food and staff! I just moved here and this is the classic moving on with life even with COVID! Congrats, Mario and team! You have now inherited a regular - don’t let up!!! William"
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you William! We enjoy seeing you and so happy to welcome you into the neighborhood. Cheers!
Tarragon Cafe,This cafe won't last long. Overpriced bland food. Rude chef in the back who needs anger management courses. Don't waste your money here. Best to go to Cafe Reveille or Duboce Park Cafe nearby.
Tarragon Cafe,"It was affordable, good, healthy food! We got our food quickly and the salad was full of a diversity of vegetables."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Nicole!
Tarragon Cafe,"Lovely people, all food fresh and healthy. So happy to have a good group back in that space, we go there often (office on same block). Good vegetarian options, too!"
Tarragon Cafe,Very nice and friendly people! I love both the food and the coffee. Their Cesar salad  is big and very tasty!
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you for your kind review Parastoo! We are happy to have such lovely customers like you. Hope to see you soon!

Tarragon Cafe,"Sándwiches were delicious! Wasn’t blown away by the pastry selection or coffee, but definitely a nice new addition to the neighborhood :)"
Tarragon Cafe,"Hi Erin, we had to cut back on our pastry selection due to business dropping during the stay at home orders. Now that things are opening back up, we are adding more products very soon! Thank you for your review."
Tarragon Cafe,"The avocado toast was better than I expected, tasty with absolutely fresh ingredients. Fruit was as fresh and sweet as you can get it."
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Cedric! We take pride in using only the freshest ingredients. Hope to see you soon
Tarragon Cafe,Decided to pop by the new cafe and loved it! The food and coffee were delish! Thanks for the great service too! Can’t wait to go back and try out the other items on the menu!
Tarragon Cafe,Great coffee and food! Had Mario's Caesar salad and it was perfect! Good americano and iced latte as well. Very nice and friendly service too 🙂 …
Tarragon Cafe,Good coffee. Food is also good but portion sizes are small for the price so dropping 1 start. If Im paying $13 for a frittata Im expecting more than one small slice
Tarragon Cafe,Bathroom was out of service. But food was very good.
Tarragon Cafe,"Sorry about the bathroom! It happens sometimes when people throw things in the toilet that they shouldn’t. Usually, very temporary."
Tarragon Cafe,Really fantastic quaint little spot with sun and shade with great coffee. A hidden SF gem
Tarragon Cafe,Thank you Isaac! Can’t wait to see you again soon!
