Capital One Café,"This Peet’s is a hidden gem, with perks for being a Capital One cardholder (discounted coffee anyone!?!). Nice to swing by early in the morning for a cup, and set up my laptop to work for a few hours. I usually sit in the mezzanine area, which doesn’t have outlets readily available, so bring a device that’s charged (not sure about the outlets on the main or lower level).  I have only stopped in for my coffee and place to work outside of my apartment, but the staff come across as very friendly and ready to help if you have banking questions."
Capital One Café,We gotta keep the caffeine *and* electricity flowing to ensure both you and your mobile devices stay charged. Rest assured we'll get this feedback in front of the right folks. ^AS
Capital One Café,"I used to love this place when it opened. With time it totally changed and finally when staff stopped me from taking photos that was the end.  I live in Marin and tomorrow I am GOING ALL THE WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO just to make a cash deposit which is impossible anywhere else.  I will from now on keep a MINIMUM balance there.  A trip to SF, and Parking just to make a cash deposit."
Capital One Café,"I used to go here twice a day when it was a “real Peet’s” at the Cafe. Now it’s a Cafe serving Peet’s coffee. The lattes taste like they are watered down and you have to ask for extra foam to get any foam.  After going there for probably six years since it opened it’s a huge disappointment.  Please bring back the real Peet’s.  It was such a wonderful treat to get half price real Pete’s coffee latte’s and service was absolutely outstanding. They knew your name, and what you wanted before you got to the cashier. There was always a long line, but it went fast…..    people are noticing and not as many people are going there like they used to.   It’s a whole different vibe now. Someone made a mistake!  They Should have signed the lease/business deal to keep the real Peet’s there!!!  The capital one staff are very nice and helpful! There’s seminars are really great and educational."
Capital One Café,Hey Shirley - This definitely isn't the vibe we strive for. You can rest assured that we've passed this feedback along to the right folks and your voice is heard. ^AJS
Capital One Café,I arrive at a bank that has been converted to a cafe - Capital One Cafe! Is this because banks are failing ; it comes across as a plump and cherubic child working on acquiring a shape and style ; it is a WeWork space and will never become a neighborhood cafe; the concept is to attract clients for banking services by offering them a cafe space and the free Bic plastic ball point pen - woohoo!!!
Capital One Café,"Just dropped for some new accounts problem. The Capital One Ambassador,Hannah, was wonderful, friendly, and very helpful. Definitely I chose the right online bank and credit card company, Capital One 👍 …"
Capital One Café,Always happy to lend a helping Hannah 😉^AS
Capital One Café,The baristas and ambassadors are so friendly. Check in monthly for events and happy hours to receive discounts on drinks! Good place to get some work done and clean bathrooms as well. Makes me feel taken care of as a client. Thanks!
Capital One Café,"We like to keep things so fresh, and so clean, clean. ^DR"
Capital One Café,A great coffee shop and work space in San Francisco. You can have seats from the lower level to 2nd level.
Capital One Café,Quick and convenient. Nice to have a Capital One location for East Coaster like me.  Deposit cash/checks to your Capital One/360 accounts here!
Capital One Café,Outside of serving coffee and providing an ATM there is nothing this place can do for you.
Capital One Café,"Fixed my credit card problem here with the help of a Capital One employees here! I was greeted very warm, he listen to my problem and we talked to customer service on the phone and fixed my problem. I forgot to get his name, but I would definitely give him more stars for his time and patience there.  Other than minimal banking service, this is actually a study/work cafe with Peet's stand inside.  Very fast internet, cool A/C and nice people. Definitely an everyday place if you like working from coffee shops!"
Capital One Café,"I recently visited the 101 Post Street - San Francisco Peets location.  I was so happy with EVERYTHING - the entire visit and experience was fantastic!  Shaie and Ho were the barista team.  I was impressed with how well they worked together - they were so helpful, professional, patient, pleasant and kind. These are the traits, and the type of people, that create loyal customers.  I normally only get a black coffee, but Shaie introduced me to a new beverage - it was a treat for myself and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ho prepared the beverage to perfection.  Also, the store environment was perfect - every Peets manager in the city needs to come to this location to see how it is done right - super clean and welcoming surroundings.  Please share these positive comments with Shaie and Ho, the store managers, and any other relevant personnel.  They deserve to be recognized - I hope they are rewarded for doing such a fine job.  Thank you!"
Capital One Café,Name a better duo than Shaie and Ho—we'll wait. 😎 ^JM
Capital One Café,"This place is AWESOME. Discounted coffee just for having a capital one card. Rick was so welcoming when we got in, and it's a great place to work for the day if you're just visiting."
Capital One Café,"No arguments here! Thanks for stopping in, Ryan :) ^AJS"
Capital One Café,"I am interested in Capital one 360 checking account with lots of questions. Before talking to Hannah in the cafe, I called the customer service at least twice and it somewhat helped. I am happy that I tried calling here and had my questions clarified. Hannah is very approachable and willing to spend the time to help out. Thank you."
Capital One Café,"So glad to hear we're giving it our all from all sides. Thanks for taking the time to give us the run down, Jialing.^AS"
Capital One Café,"Have been customer 16 years and the quality of service has declined greatly. They had a big customer data breach in recent years and wouldn't tell me if my account was affected. Disputing charges used to be possible online but now requires a lengthy phone call. Even with excellent credit, on time payments, and increased income and savings I have not been able to get a credit limit increase in about 10 years. Their branches keep closing. I wonder if they're going out of business so I'm seriously considering closing my accounts with them."
Capital One Café,"A clean, bright cafe conveniently located downtown, with plenty of seating & outlets. They have great deals on coffee - I just wish they were open on weekends too!"
Capital One Café,"Great space and lovely place to study and read. However, while the staff are very friendly, they are ironically enough the loudest part of this cafe. They seem to be talking with each other all the time and are pretty loud, pretty inconsiderate of the customers as a result. I don't expect it to be silent, but the noise from the workers can get a bit overboard. Hope this is somehow addressed."
Capital One Café,"While we love to be the life of the financial party, we can understand needing some down time here. We'll make sure we get this feedback in front of the right eyes.^AS"
Capital One Café,"On my work-from-home day I was in search of finding a nice place outside of my house to concentrate and stumbled upon this excellent location! Seems like it's designed for you to go in and do work, plus it's got Peet's coffee and pastries. Loved that they had meeting rooms too. I used my capital one card so got 50% off my drink, which was nice. The construction is a bit loud but I'm sure it'll be even more fabulous once it's done."
Capital One Café,"Glad you dug the digs, Peggy—shucks, we *work* here and drop in on our work-from-home days sometimes. Here's to half-off coffee and your next visit! ^MS"
Capital One Café,"I came here hoping to talk to a real person about my missing credit card, since customer support by phone is a truly awful experience, but all they could tell me was to call the customer support line again. I don't know what the use of a physical office is if they can't even look me up in the system and tell my why I haven't received my credit card yet. They gave me a support line number which supposedly would not make me talk to the robot, but it did. I found out later from my partner that I should just try pressing 0 and that finally put me through to a real person. Why didn't the cafe staff just tell me that?"
Capital One Café,"Treat like a coffee shop, that is sunny, comfortable and safe. Great place to catch up on email after shopping. 🫶 …"
Capital One Café,"A good co-working space to get some work done. Peets coffee is right by so you can always get something if you want to. What is really nice is that you don't have to consume necessarily. You can just swing by and focus on your work.  There is free WIFI but it's fairly slow, so don't expect too much. This place has plenty of sitting opportunities and three floors so a seat is always guaranteed.  Overall a nice and quiet place which is great for working alone or in small teams. Would definitely recommend!"
Capital One Café,"Half off drinks with a Capital One card. Coffee, tea, and other drinks."
Capital One Café,"I received excellent customer service from Capital One Representatives, who were polite, professional, and effective. It is also a great place to get a coffee and do some work."
Capital One Café,Great place for me to get my coffee when I am in San Francisco.  They offer Peet’s coffee and offer a discount if you pay with your Capital One Card.  I like that they offer a lot of space to sit for a while and use the internet.  The reps offer you any help you need with your Capital One accounts but they don’t offer full service for the accounts.
Capital One Café,"Peet's, Love, & Happiness—that's the dream & we're livin' it up in the Bay Area. ^NW"
Capital One Café,"Peet’s Cafe, free WiFi, space to work, bathroom and more! Friendly bank ambassadors !"
Capital One Café,"This is by far the coolest coffee shop and workspace I've ever seen. Such a fun space for a Peets! Love that they offer discounts with your Capital One card half off everything, so definitely don't forget your card at home."
Capital One Café,Brand new Capital One Cafe! Really nice and friendly staff and delicious coffee
Capital One Café,"Yeah, we did some market testing with grouchy staff & stale coffee, but this seemed to test better. ^NW"
Capital One Café,"This place is cool but now often it is crowded. The service at Peets coffee could be better. Even when it's not busy the order took a while and came out with a burnt egg and cheese. I also asked for a cup of ice which they forget.  Overall the Internet is decent, Wifi would cut in and out for me. The basement has the Bathrooms. No real problems with bums and Crazy tweakers here, since they have staff patrol. A great job on Capitol One's part.A mega corporation offers a creative space like this for the public is great. So many outlets! The location has a guard and sometimes Cop also. That is why the bums dont linger here. There is always going to be Riff raff but unlike New York where you might visit the Public Library and be inspired here in SF you might robbed. You can buy coffee of course and the Baristas are usually pretty Nice. They have ambassadors whos job mainly consists of standing around but grab some stickers. Would be five stars if the Tables in the Nooks were a bit Better. Two Levels here with Great Street Views."
Capital One Café,We love where your head's at and feedback is key here—we'll get this post doc'd to ensure your voice is heard. ^DR
Capital One Café,"This is my go-to meeting spot in SF. It's really close to BART, it has a beautifully modern design, and there's a ton of open space.  There are three floors, each with plenty of tables and couches. If I'm ever in the area and I need a place to sit down and get some work down, I'll definitely make a stop here. They have free wifi and Peet's coffee, perfect for spending an entire afternoon here."
Capital One Café,"Not be a homer (lol), but we couldn't agree more. ^AJS"
Capital One Café,Although I drove all the way to San Francisco from Stockton thinking I was going to get some resolution to a situation I didn't get it. Although the woman that works at the Capital One Cafe was very informative and even though I wasn't happy to have to go to the situation she explains a lot to me. To Capital One Cafe it's a good job. To Capital One itself you suck
Capital One Café,Great experience! Keep it up Capitol one ☝️
Capital One Café,"I'm highly amused by a cafe sponsored by a company, but you gotta get people interested in your bank somehow, right? Aside from all the branding, this is an excellent space to hang out and get some work done. The Peets Coffee menu includes many of my favorites and the dirty chai they made perked me right up. Love their pastry selection, too.  I appreciate that you don't *need* to buy anything to hang in this place. It's not a Peet's, it's a Capital One lounge with benefits.  The seating areas are scattered all over and you can find plenty of comfortable chairs, small tables as well as big, and everyone is very heads down working.  Bonus if you're a capital one customer (I am not) you get 50% off coffee drinks and maybe some other perks? I didn't look into it too much as I don't benefit. Nice idea, though."
Capital One Café,"Great place to work. Can be a bit noisy though. But you can bring headphones if you'd like. Wi-Fi isn't super fast, but it'll do the trick. For some strange reason WatsApp won't work with the Wi-Fi. I love how you can hang out without being obliged to buy stuff. You can even bring outside food. And if you have a Capital One card, you get 50% all the Peet's products. Plus, the ATM is free to use. Which apparently is still something special circa 2016 in this country."
Capital One Café,"THIS IS NOT A BANK. They do not have tellers or a vault. It's is just a coffee shop and in an empty room. It's a way for capital one to promote/hype themselves, but instead of doing so by providing great banking services, you just get free coffee and wifi."
Capital One Café,"This cafe is awesome! They offer Peets coffee, pastries, yogurt, salads, and sandwiches. Capital 1 customers get 50% drinks. The staff can help if you want to open a new account or make changes to an existing one.  The space is really big and open for the public to use. Large groups can also sign up to rent it out."
Capital One Café,"Best free coworking and meeting space in the city: ◆ plenty of space on every of three floors; ◆ sockets near almost every desk; ◆ working Wi-Fi (could be faster, but it works reliably); ◆ 50% discount for every drinks at Pet's Coffee in the place; ◆ you can start working early (7 am — 6 pm); ◆ helpful Capital One Ambassadors could fix you banking issues."
Capital One Café,"They serve up Peet's Coffee here and their drinks are slightly cheaper! You get a discount if you have a Capital One card. Check out their pastries too, they source locally from other small bakeries. I had a really delicious liege waffle here."
Capital One Café,"Outclass , capital one and Peet’s two in one , great taste in low price with capital one card , I’m sure if you drink ever Peet’s , then first go there ( if you have capital one credit card ) or not no problem go there and there is a person which guides you for capital one card and then you can drink coffee in half price but ask each and every thing because I am a lover of coffee so that’s why I only make make card , which gives discounts on hot coffee or chocolate or others . Also there is huge settings and meetings area as per need . I’m sure capital one bank is great to give us this beautiful area in San Francisco"
Capital One Café,"If you have a Capital One card, this Peets is unbelievably well priced as you'll receive 50% off all drinks. Very nice and friendly staff. Clean. Free wifi. Plenty of seating. Queue moves fast."
Capital One Café,"What's not to like? For those who are office nomads, It's centrally located, the space is free to use, and there are lot's of electrical outlets.  As importantly, the people are nice and the coffee is good and strong,. The last time I was in they had homemade soup.  It can get noisy, so bring earphones if that's a problem!"
Capital One Café,"It's okay, plenty of tables and seats, can get crowded at certain times to the point where you can't find a place to sit and work. There's 3 floors, the first floor has bean bag 'chairs', second floor is where the cafe is at and more tables and chairs on the third floor. The cafe has internet, restrooms and coffee is decent but not spectacular."
Capital One Café,"A big space to get some work done. You can stay all day if you want, since its designed to be a free co-working space with  many seatings and no rush for consuming something from the cafe, which offers pre-packaged food and beverages and serves Peet's Coffee. I attended to a mentoring event hosted by Sparkr. Similar events seems to happen here too. The atmosphere is nice and active. And of course, there will always be an associate willing to help you in case you want to open an account or manage your savings."
Capital One Café,"I was in Capital One 360 Café the other day for a latte and a choco taco (very tasty, I had seconds). The wifi has much improved in recent months. You ATM card does indeed get you half-off on coffee, but is also great for getting cash from ATMs in out-of-the-way corners of town. There is a choice of seating here, too."
Capital One Café,"Capital One 360 Café is both a large, three-story cafe and a Capital One bank branch. Their 50% off in-house Peets Coffee offerings are a tempting reason to open an account with Capital One. The wifi is fast, and the seating can be very comfortable. The only restrooms to be found seem to be at the bottom floor. Enjoy the wall-to-wall views of the city from the windows as you go through each floor to find the restrooms."
Capital One Café,"Huge branch with employees who seem to be having a ton of fun. When I visited, there were 2 in particular playing giant Jenga. Lots of varied seating (standing and sitting) with outlets. Laptop friendly"
Capital One Café,"I'm disappointed with the work atmosphere at the cafe. It's a great idea, but poorly implemented. The aspect I have the biggest problem with is the noise. They don't have a set music station for calm background music to work to. They have an iPad, and whoever has the iPad gets to pick the music. Unfortunately, that means one person can pick party music to listen to and everybody has to listen to it. There is nowhere to hide from the music unless you have earphones and listen to your own. I also wish they had tables that were tall enough to use as standing desks. There are some that are almost tall enough, but not quite (I'm 5'8"").  Pros: free wifi, they don't make you buy a drink, relaxed atmosphere"
Capital One Café,"A very strange synergy of bank (Capital One Bank) and coffeeshop (Peet's Coffee). I've never seen anything quite like it. Surprising ""lively"" and ""comfy"" for a downtown, high-volume, corporate coffeeshop. They do a peculiar deal where you can buy drinks for half price if you use a Capital One credit card. I still don't know what to make of this weird union of corporations... But coffee is adequate, and the seating is comfortable."
Capital One Café,Excellent place to work and meet up with friends or for business. The café was originally started by ING Direct (a dutch company) as a marketing concept and continued by Capital One when they bought ING's US operations out. You get great prices on coffee as well if you bank with them.
Capital One Café,My team and I spent all summer here - we wouldn't have had a place to work on our little start up without Capital One.  The staff is really wonderful and friendly - we've made friends over the many weeks here.
Capital One Café,They were close to closing and we're helping other clients but the two folks (12/6) working made sure that I and the lady who came after me who couldn't speak English were seen.
Capital One Café,"After a confusing transaction trying to put money towards my statement balance on one of the location's automated machines, I was in need of help to assure that my $1,000+ deposit had gone through. After reaching out to an, Mason, an employee near the machine, I received not only a great amount of help in trying to resolve the issue but overall the best customer service assistance I have ever received in my entire life. I had had a long, tiring day and was pretty dismayed when I couldn't determine definitively if my deposit had gone through or not. Mason helped to not only reassure me but also went above and beyond to cover all bases just in case the amount for whatever reason would not credit to my account by the next day. This all happened today so I am still not sure how the situation will turn out regarding the actual deposit but I do know that I could not have received any greater customer service than I did today. No matter what the turnout, thank you, Mason, for going so out of your way to help me on what was already a very long and stressful day for me! I can't over-express my gratitude"
Capital One Café,Peet's coffee with capital one discount. Lots of space to hang out and great location.
Capital One Café,"This is one of the better public spaces to work at, especially if you have a larger group. There's a ton of seating, and the area spans three floors. Last time I went the wifi was really slow, but I don't think that is the norm."
Capital One Café,"First time coffee shop with bank Name. Management was great ,everything looks perfect I got discounts also with my capital one credit card . Great place for coffee and meet friend .:)"
Capital One Café,A friend at Peet's is a friend who's neat. ^NW
Capital One Café,"The best Coffice in SF. Plenty of space, couches, outlets, AND $1.50 for a LARGE coffee? You can't beat that. If you have a capital one debit card you get discounts too! Definitely one of my favorite places to meet and work!"
Capital One Café,Great place to read or work. Good tables and internet connection.
Capital One Café,This is a nice place in the center of the city. I stopped here after walking around to recharge my phone and get a cup of hot coffee. It's a capital one bank on the top level but a Peet's coffee on the lower level.
Capital One Café,"I receive 5-6 email ads from you even though I've tried repeatedly to stop them coming to my email box... I called you, the company, and not only did you not help me, you hung up on me... Maybe I should go to the BBB??? Your customer service is disgusting!!!"
Capital One Café,Great spot to sit down and get some work done or make user of the great wifi. There's very good coffee and plenty of places to plug in your laptop.
Capital One Café,One of the best spots to work from and meet great talented people. The staff are extremely nice and helpful and the coffee is great! (Peet's coffee served there).  Enjoy!
Capital One Café,"Be aware that they are closed until 8/13/19. Made a point to study here, only to find it under construction. Spent the following hour on an impossible mission, searching for a cafe with power outlets and bathrooms (a pregnancy must) in the area. Wish their special hours had been posted on Google."
Capital One Café,"We definitely hear you on this and we're pretty bummed we missed you. Rest assured, we've slid this feedback in front of the right teams to ensure the right eyes are on it.^AS"
Capital One Café,"Great coffee and great work space, but it might be good to have a sign somewhere before you order coffee and plop down to work that they don't have a working bathroom."
Capital One Café,"Happy to report things are back up & running on that end—good call on the sign though, we'll make sure to get this review in front of Café leadership for you. ^NW"
Capital One Café,"Warning, this is not Peet’s."
Capital One Café,"Its a good IDEA as an experiential 'pop up' store (if you like) _ but Capital One's problem is more on thei product side init? The 360 product is treated like a trendy throw away idea - whilst its actually the CLOSEST Capital One has every been to a legitimate 'tech' model.  The staffers need to be trained to bend over backwards for the future of digital cash products. (in other words, this is no where near the likes of a leading edge product like Paypal)"
Capital One Café,Great place to cowork or to work. Bonus: if you have a capital one card then you get discounts on your Peets drinks. Sometimes the internet drops in the afternoon.
Capital One Café,"Whether you're co-working or co-caffeinating, we've got you covered. ^NW"
Capital One Café,Cozy coworking space and good cappuccino.
Capital One Café,Hannah is truly amazing! She is very helpful and professional.  Thank you!
Capital One Café,"Great spot for coworking. Given people pay hundreds a month for a desk downtown, a free space with conference rooms and a coffee shop is awesome."
Capital One Café,Great clean place to study with tons of space to work and study.  Half off Peet's coffee when you use your capital one card too.
Capital One Café,A discounted Peet's drink is a brew-tiful thing for sure. Consider it the least we can do to espresso our gratitude to folks like you. ;) ^MS
Capital One Café,One of the best cafés to get work done in San Francisco. You'll find yourself between a plethora of energetic startups. Needs more seating!
Capital One Café,Not sure where else to leave a review for capital one. Their call wait time is insane. Not uncommon to be on hold for 40 minutes. Website / app is good otherwise.
Capital One Café,Good coffee and a great environment.  Lots of space to sit down and work for a while.  The wifi speed isn't half bad either.
Capital One Café,"Great coffee at 50% off, who could say no to that? I always grab a muffin too, which is always enjoyable.  Service is always fast and friendly."
Capital One Café,Surprised that this is a bank. Great relaxing atmosphere for coffee
Capital One Café,Pretty fun for a bank cafe. This is a flagship location.  All kind of ppl go through here.  There is litter of events along with free coaching
Capital One Café,Nice spot to work great wifi
Capital One Café,"Great place to work, and a really good banking solution for those who don't get along with the big 3.. Only complaint, that they don't have one of these in Every major metropolitan city."
Capital One Café,They don't know how to do a café au lait. Probably one of the worst I ever had. I have a hard time drinking it. 1 star for the place and the wifi though.
Capital One Café,A lot of construction going on right now. But I can see how this place can be pretty cool. The 50% off with a capital one card was pretty neat.
Capital One Café,"We hear you on the construction for sure... consider your feedback documented and in front of the right folks. But, hey—half-priced coffee is still pretty sweet, right? ^MS"
Capital One Café,"One of my favorite places to work. Spacious, has coffee shop, and decent internet connection."
Capital One Café,TERRIBLE WiFi - basically non-useable. Great space and Peet’s —- but the WiFi problems make it impossible to work here
Capital One Café,Great deals on coffee if you’re a Capital One customer! 50% all Peets beverages - what a deal.
Capital One Café,Cool atmosphere and people watching. These are the best ATMs! They give multiple denominations of bills.
Capital One Café,Awesome place to browse internet or work with lots of seating options and cool environment
Capital One Café,"This review's got us thinking they should rename the city San Friendcisco, because this review's giving us the warm and fuzzies 🥰 ^AJS"
Capital One Café,Getting your money to their accounts was easy.  Getting your money out is a terrible experience.  Stick to credit cards.
Capital One Café,"Great atmosphere, Peet’s inside, Peet’s staff is awesome! Cool place to get away from it all and grab a drink."
Capital One Café,"Nice San Francisco find! Great atmosphere, free wifi and Peet's coffee."
Capital One Café,Nice coffee shop with good variety. They really push that capital one punishment on you though.
Capital One Café,Great spot with a peets coffee and some great spots to sit and people watch or use a laptop or have a meeting.
Capital One Café,"Delicious scones, croissants and coffee."
Capital One Café,"In case the coffee wasn't clear, we <3 you, Cecilia. ^AJS"
Capital One Café,Terrific place to work in the city.  Coffee is nice as well!
Capital One Café,"Love this place. Great to chill, work, or meet friends. A properly modern bank."
Capital One Café,Nice people but they really screwed up an ice tea How do you mess up an unsweetened ice tea?
Capital One Café,Certainly not the experience we're going for - thanks for looping us in. Rest assured we've documented your feedback and will get it in front of the right folks. ^MS
Capital One Café,"The wifi did not work, but it's a good location to get work done."
Capital One Café,Our office is your office – thanks for posting up to hunker down. PS: We’ll be sure to get your wifi feedback in front of the right folks for review – thanks for the heads-up.
Capital One Café,It's a Peets that you can cowork from for free  Bootstrap your next tech startup today
Capital One Café,"It's just a Peet's, but there's lots of seating and it has a good vibe."
Capital One Café,"Good place to work, but the wifi connection is usually unstable."
Capital One Café,"Great place to work, have a drink…."
Capital One Café,"Good location, good selection of food and drink, clean environment, and quiet place to work."
Capital One Café,Half OFF ! ( w / Capitol One Card )
Capital One Café,Great place to work in SF. Tables are a little sticky.
Capital One Café,This is a cool cafe to work from. It's located in downtown too.

Capital One Café,Awesome
Capital One Café,Temporary closed
Capital One Café,staff is friendly also
Capital One Café,Cool Hangout Spot
Capital One Café,Clean restrooms without pass codes or locks are downstairs.
Capital One Café,"This is the best cafe in downtown San Francisco to work on a laptop. It is a very spacious cafe on the 3rd floor. There is a bathroom on the first floor, like a basement, and cold air gathers here, so you can work a little cooler. The second floor is a space where you can buy coffee, but there are large tables, so many people come and work here. The third floor was a good space for those who came alone. There were mainly tables for two, and each table had an outlet, so it was good to work.  Especially compared to other cafes, it's a very good place to work downtown on weekdays and Saturdays because it's late."
Capital One Café,"Every Friday during July-August, all drinks are $1! The original price was over $11 for two cups, but I got it for $2. There are many cafes around here that close early around lunchtime, but I like it better because they stay late. The space is cool and it's good to work with a laptop 😋"
Capital One Café,Home at the top. Clean place. Warm. Perfect iced tea. Wi-Fi connection very good.
Capital One Café,Perfect for coffee and work. Close to the Bart stop and downtown
