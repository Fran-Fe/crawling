Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"From the moment I entered, I was made to feel very welcome indeed. The staff couldn't have been more cheerful, and the ordering process was seamless. I thoroughly enjoyed the avocado toast but the real draws were the bright surroundings & personable staff. Looking forward to many return visits!"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"I absolutely loved the vibe, the atmosphere, the feel, the decor, and the color scheme of this café and restaurant. The gluten free avocado toast with a poached egg was okay. It needed salt. But I’d love to come back and try new things."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Hey Julie,  We're so happy to hear that you love the ambiance and vibe of our SoMa Coffee Shop! We hope to see you back again soon for another delicious coffee and avocado toast :)  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Great space, rather a lot of seating so looks good for work as well. Friendly staff and quicke service. Tried a cappuccino with oat milk, it was very good, not the best I've had but I would definitely go back!"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Cheers Nathalie! We hope to have you back in again soon!  -The BL Team
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Nice Australian coffee shop offering full coffee menu, sandwiches, and light bites. Great location, with lots of seating and open windows. Reasonably priced for the neighborhood. Really good avocado toast 🥑 …"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Cheers Joyce! We hope to see you again soon!  -The BL Team
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Came here to pick up a Neighbor Bakery hazelnut raspberry croissant because we were nearby and didn’t want to drive to Dogpatch. The lady working there seemed very disinterested in serving us (unlike most bluestone lane staff I’ve come across in other locations). The croissant was also quite disappointing. It was quite soggy inside (see photo). It was before noon when I got it so it shouldn’t have become so stale if it was delivered in the morning. I highly doubt that bluestone lane will sell day-old croissants? But this one had truly underwhelming texture and is $1.05 more than if you get it from Neighbor.

Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Shop has a decent atmosphere, but the drinks are mediocre and the wait is super long."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Awesome toasts and drinks. I got the prosciutto toast and my friend got the avocado toast. The avocado toast was boasting with avocado and seasoned very well. The prosciutto was well balanced with tomatoes, lettuce and cheese."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Hi Racquel,  We love that you are loving our drinks and food menu at our 55 2nd St location! We appreciate the support of our new location and hope to see you back again soon at your new local!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"I put an Ubereats order with them to have breakfast delivered to our office for an important meeting, 4 items were missing. I would totally understand if 1 item was missing but 4 item is simply unacceptable. And there is no phone number listed on google in case you want to address your concerns or any kind of customer service. So don’t rely on this place when ordering for work or an important event. It doesn’t matter if the food tastes good, it’s just not reliable."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,The people who work here are wonderful and the coffee is consistently good.
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Hi Spencer - thank you so much for taking the time to share your positive experience with us! We're thrilled to hear that you've enjoyed both the service and coffee. We appreciate your kind words and look forward to seeing you again!
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"The food was decent. I know this brand from NYC. This unit felt a bit soulless. As if I ordered at Chipotle rather than a friendly neighborhood joint. Maybe intentional, but I prefer a more personalized experience."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Hey mate – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Great coffee, and food was surprisingly good. Only thing I didn't like were the lack of a menu board and automated cashier machines. They were too slow and confusing. Prefer people over machines."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Hey mate – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Vibe is great, but as an Aussie I cannot say this is representative of Australian coffee at all (tried it twice just to be sure). I don't think it's the baristas' fault, more likely the beans."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"The coffee is usually good, but their food is overpriced and often comes wrong. I ordered and was charged for a poached egg over avocado toast, but didn’t get it and wasn’t given a refund when I complained after I realized."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Hey Jing,  Thank you for taking the time in bringing this to our attention. This is not the service we expect for our customers - we know we can do better and we will be passing this on to the Store's General Manager for this to be addressed.

Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,Hey Den Jezhel – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local!
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Been curious to check this place out as I walk past most days and went in this morning for breakfast. But when I tried to pay, I was told that they do not accept cash as legal tender.  I find it excessive to require bank involvement to purchase a cup of coffee and a pastry. So I enjoyed my cappuccino and pastry from Red Door Cafe across the street."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Hey Michael,  Thanks for stopping by and for taking the time to provide us with you feedback. We made the decision to not accept cash so that we can spend less time counting and more time making your day great. If there’s anything else that you think we can improve on or change at this location, please feel free to email us at: feedback@bluestonelane.com  Cheers, The BL Team"

Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"Matcha Latte really impressed me-- strong matcha notes- and the milk didn't over-power-it-- honestly, compared to quick-watered-down-matcha drinks that you usually get elsewhere for the same price, this was a step-above-- will buy again- I like it with no sweetener- good work"
