Angel Cafe & Deli,"My 'Heavenly Breakfast Bagel' was freshly made: tomato, lettuce, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese and an egg - $8.50. The 'English Breakfast Muffin' I had the other day was light, tasty and grease free. The place is clean, and the friendly, professional staff have served me good, strong coffee all week."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Russell we truly appreciate your awesome feedback thank you for your business 
Angel Cafe & Deli,This place is more about convenience than anything else. Most of the items are microwaved and some bakery items are just bought elsewhere and repackaged. I don't hate it but I definitely don't recommend it.
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Sa Nja we loved your feedback 
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Good coffee and the heavenly breakfast bagel was terrific. Location isn’t ideal but good for a stop in if you’re nearby. I probably wouldn’t get some of the deli items but the bagels, pastries and coffee seemed like a can’t miss."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Stephen thank you very much for your awesome feedback. We appreciate you.
Angel Cafe & Deli,This is a fantastic cafe. I’m a big fan of the heavenly bagel with its light balsamic vinegar. They have a great dirty chai as well. Definitely give this place a try if you’re in the area. The staff are great and the seating has a nice ambiance.
Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate your feedback Isabella  Thank you 
Angel Cafe & Deli,During our 10 day trip to SF we had every breakfast at Angel Cafe and enjoyed it very much. The owners are friendly and the bagels are amazing - our favorite was definitely the heavenly breakfast bagel! They also offer a (green tea) chai latte which is absolutely incredible.  Looking forward to coming back on our next trip to SF!
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Tatyana  thank you for your business We hope to see you again
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Walk out of the Beresford Arms Hotel 🏨 and turn left. 1mins walk to the end of the block and turn left onto Leavenworth. Walk down the block 1minute onto Geary.  You won't be disappointed!! This deli and cafe looks a bit basic from the outside, but the food and service is 2nd to non. Wonderful quality and value for money in San Francisco 👏 Bravo Angel Cafe!!!"
Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate your awesome feedback WABBA Thank you

Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate your feedback Josh thank you for your support 
Angel Cafe & Deli,We ordered Angel cafe&deli packed lunches for a group of 44 people 6 days in a row. Top organisation with a system of number for each kid to take their pack in a second and a large range of choices. Delicious and healthy sandwiches. Very grateful for this service which was not easy for the owner who even provided us lunches on the day they were supposed to be closed. Very nice and helpful.
Angel Cafe & Deli,It was my pleasure serving you and the group Virginie. Your business much appreciated 
Angel Cafe & Deli,I appreciate you guys for being open at an early hour. I was so surprised that sf had so few places to grab a bite before 7.
Angel Cafe & Deli,Kenny it’s our pleasure to serve you thank you 
Angel Cafe & Deli,"If you want to have the BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO you have to visit this spot !! If there is more than 5 Stars I would give it to these people 🥰 all the breakfast items are really good , very clean spot , service is great! They have some homemade items that are so yummmyyyyy🥰🥰🥰"

Angel Cafe & Deli,It was my pleasure serving you and your folks Laura hopefully to see you again thank you
Angel Cafe & Deli,One of the better cafes on the edge of Lower Nob hill. My go-to’s are The San Francisco Bagel sandy and the prosciutto panini 🙌  Hard to beat prices as well.  Definitely recommend if you are in the area.
Angel Cafe & Deli,Kevin we are so happy to hear that we appreciate your awesome business and support thank You
Angel Cafe & Deli,Excellence does not have to be fancy. We had great basic bagels and breakfast sandwiches. The staff is friendly and cheerful and it runs off on the other customers. Good coffee.
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Zeke we appreciate your business
Angel Cafe & Deli,Everything was good!! I love them coffee that they made!!!
Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate your feedback Blanca thank you for your support 
Angel Cafe & Deli,The espresso was bitter tasting. I've had better instant coffee. The heavenly bagel was akin to fast food and had sorry looking precooked eggs and the cheese wasn't melted. Can't recommend.
Angel Cafe & Deli,Their breakfast sandwiches are pretty amazing. This is a double meat bagel. Totally worth it!
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Chicken pesto sandwich was subpar, the chicken was a dry cooked slab similar to Subway chicken sandwiches. Onions and pickles were not evenly distributed, so some bites were almost all onion. The pesto was nice though."
Angel Cafe & Deli,So sorry to hear you didn’t like our food i jope can make it up to you next time
Angel Cafe & Deli,Delicious bagels - had to get our breakfast on the go and had several people ask where we got it! Really nice staff as well!
Angel Cafe & Deli,We are so glad that you liked our food Jessica we appreciate your business
Angel Cafe & Deli,This place is little gem. We went to have breakfast there not onve but twice and I am not person that likes to go to the same place bc I love trying new places. But if you want to something delicious that wont take 45 minutes to get on your table hit this place. Their coffee selection is really good and food...yummy. Bagels are so awesome and pastry is so good that you will lick your fingers. I would recomend almond croisant and San Francisco bagel. The owner is so sweet and accomadating it makes me love this place even more.
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Very nice staff, really good donuts and the sandwiches look amazing; I will update when I taste them :) UPDATE *** the chorizo burrito was not at all good, but the inside of this place is warm and friendly, donuts are good and I’m sure they have a lot of other things to offer."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Monesha
Angel Cafe & Deli,I walked here and sadly the open times on here must be incorrect because sadly they are closed
Angel Cafe & Deli,We are very sorry it must be a mistake but we closed on Tuesday. Please stop by later this week and we will make it up to you thank you for your awesome feedback 
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Friendly staff, good breakfast bagels 👍"
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Yurii we appreciate your business
Angel Cafe & Deli,This unassuming little Cafe is more than worth your time and money! I ordered a homemade cheesecake and a lox bagel...the owner offered to set up a small table and a chair so that I could eat my breakfast before I walked back to my hotel with the cheesecake. The lox bagel was delicious and so was the maple bacon cronut. Hands down the best cronut I have ever had (it had cream inside!!) and hands down my new favorite cafe in the US!
Angel Cafe & Deli,"What a friendly place to visit. The Heavenly on an everything bagel was very good. Most bagel sandwiches slide apart, but this one was expertly  put together AND loaded with plenty of delicious veggies. Just a very warm and happy place to get a quick yummy bite."
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Amazing food, low key chill, angels everywhere"
Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate your awesome feedback Adriano. Thank you 
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Friendly place in the tenderloin district in SF.  Had a great breakfast sandwich on a garlic bagel, juice and a latte.  Clean and hospitable & friendly.  Easy to get in and out - looks like the regulars have standing orders - which bodes well for your experience as people seem to come again and again."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Their breakfast bagel is great - egg was perfectly cooked and bacon perfectly crispy. Try it with the garlic bagel!
Angel Cafe & Deli,We are so glad that you liked our breakfast Thuy thank you for your business
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Friendly service,  great prices,  and delicious food.   They offer a wide range of items.... try the deviled eggs, super good.   I haven't tried breakfast here but many people have told me it's fantastic.   Try this place,  seriously.... I'm glad I stopped this afternoon"
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Customer Service here is outstanding! I called for an early event order and not only was Nagham able to accommodate the number of orders, he also delivered the large order to the catered event. Thank you so much Nagham! All the sandwiches were delicious! I appreciate your outstanding service! Will definitely recommend this place !!👍 …"
Angel Cafe & Deli,"The food at Angels Cafe was really good. My wife, kids, and I we happy with what we had. The area had a lot of homeless which I was grateful we were able to sit inside. There are only a few seats inside and a few outside. The owner was very kind and seamed frustrated with the homeless and went outside a few times to protect some of the people seated outside from them."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Wish we had found this place sooner! Delicious food. Great clean little spot to eat. Owner is very nice. Can't wait to come back.
Angel Cafe & Deli,thank you Mgm we appreciate your help
Angel Cafe & Deli,"This place is rad for breakfast - solid bagels, with peanut butter art!"
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Came in for coffee first thing in the morning, and one of the ladies filled up a large cup right away, not bothering with charging me yet. After a second cup, I ordered a breakfast bagel sandwich, and it was quite tasty, served hot, fresh and fast. It was a good experience, if you're in the neighborhood, this place is a winner."
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Good coffee and a local favorite, I'm here multiple times a week whether for breakfast or for lunch. Closes at 2 which sucks when I'm running late but all good."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Eric we really appreciate you and we are very glad that you like our food Thank you
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Genuinely nice owners!  I had a muffin and latte to accompany my studying.  They have a small room in the back with computers, a few small round tables and a flat panel playing what appears to be Greek TV.  Definitely takes you away from the the city rush and conducive to productivity.  I haven't tried their lunch items but their Mediterranean selection looked appealing.  Would come back again!"
Angel Cafe & Deli,I order online and by the time I get there (10 minutes) it's ready. I always get the fresh orange juice with the breakfast burritto. Perfect day start...
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Miles we appreciate your business
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Family friendly, fast and convenient service. Great for a bagel or croissant breakfast on the go! Although I didn't personally have a coffee, our friend did and raved about it. I can see why it is a favorite amongst the locals."
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Picked up breakfast 3 days in a row while vacationing with family.  Breakfast panini, egg sandwich, fresh squeezed OJ, lucky charms latte, strawberry blast smoothie - all delicious.  And the service was very friendly and efficient.  Highly recommend."
Angel Cafe & Deli,"I love this place, everyone who works there is so sweet! I always go in and get their heavenly bagel and coffee. But they have so many other awesome options from breakfast items to pasta salad and beyond. Great little neighborhood spot"
Angel Cafe & Deli,This is the best bagel and coffee shop I have ever visited! I had been craving a bagel sandwich and after researching Yelp I was so happy Angel Cafe & Deli was walking distance from my hotel. I ordered the Cheesy Scrambled Eggs on an Everything bagel with a cafe au lait and it was heavenly!! My husband ordered the lox and bagel and loved his as well. The menu has so many bagel sandwich options as well as lunch items to choose from. This place is truly a gem and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a coffee shop or a delicious place to grab breakfast or lunch without dealing with long lines or crowds.
Angel Cafe & Deli,Really good food and service! We were staying at a hotel nearby and had breakfast here every morning. Definitely a great way to start your morning!
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Camilo
Angel Cafe & Deli,Soooooooooo good! Forget the crazy wait at Honey Honey and come here. Bagel breakfast sandwiches are delicious!!!
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Gabriela  we are so happy that you liked our food thank You
Angel Cafe & Deli,"From the credit card payment extortion to the disregard for safe food handling practices when they mess up your order I’d say skip it. To the man running the register, believe the woman making the food when she says that it isn’t someone’s order - and to her, I hope you’re able to speak up like that some day."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Great bagels! They stuff their fillings!
Angel Cafe & Deli,Thank you Alyson we are very grateful that you liked our food thank you
Angel Cafe & Deli,"A fantastic cafe to visit. The people who own the business are husband and wife, are so nice, always welcome the customers, the service is fast and the food always good! Highly recommend to stop by, if your in the area!"
Angel Cafe & Deli,Great little spot for quick sandwiches.
Angel Cafe & Deli,We love your feedback Nicholas thank you 
Angel Cafe & Deli,In breakfast in San Francisco for quality and price.  Lovely owner. Really tasty Chai latte.
Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate your awesome business Ronald. Thank you
Angel Cafe & Deli,"it's a very cozy and cleanly operated cofee, deli, sandwich cafe that is run by some wonderfully friendly and competent people =) it's one of the reasons to stop in the San Francisco's tenderloin district and not regret. it's got a nice outside seating area that manages to be secluded and clean oasis , yet without walls or enclosures In an otherwise  sea of human waste and degeneracy.  ok I have to add that the TL is actually a juxtaposition of amazing quality , warmth, kindness, and all around human greatness amid a sea of human waste and degeneracy... it is an odd paradigm,  but that's what makes it so human.  I like the cofee here. the background Arabic music adds to the feeling of stepping out of sf, and the prices are what you expect in sf.... sigh. quality is top notch so you get what you pay for."
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Ordered on uber eats. Very well packaged and fresh. Ordered breakfast sandwich, donut, latte. Sandwhich is amazing. Donut frosting is perfect. Latte was great. Will order again."
Angel Cafe & Deli,Quiet a peculiar place. The barista didn’t know what a macchiato was so I had to explain her and she just did half of the medium cup I asked. I guess they were new but I liked it. Would go again
Angel Cafe & Deli,great coffee and food! it’s reasonably priced but i will say the bagels are a bit pricey if you’re on a budget. my fav is the strawberry donut
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Coffee, expresso, and deli with ethnic variations. Has WiFi and access by onsite computer stations. Clean, well managed, and processing fast. This coffee bar has been remodelled within the past few years. Moderate to upper prices."
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Convenient, quick, delicious, affordable!"
Angel Cafe & Deli,We appreciate you Christina. Thank you 
Angel Cafe & Deli,"Love this place! Great customer service! Always smiling :) hidden gem  you can definitely tell its possibly family owned, im vegan and they are able  to accommodate any walk of life"
Angel Cafe & Deli,Excellent selection of toasted bagels they give you free mints with every coffee to go and outstanding staff that work very hard for their customers and outdoor seating with lots of foot traffic for the people watcher fans I give the cafe  5 stars

Was told cafe was ""closed"" when the woman behind the counter was clearly working and there were still CUSTOMERS in the store. Was forced to leave and when asked about costumers in store was told the shop was closed."
