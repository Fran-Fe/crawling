Cafe Valencia,"For anyone wanting to go to this place, make yourselves a favor and go somewhere else. I’m ashamed is a Brazilian, there are other places with better food. I order coxinha and pastel and both were tasteless (Brazilian food is not plain at all), the pastel was also cold and very think. The carrot cake was hard so was definitely old, the total of my order was $23 without tip, so very expensive. The staff was really nice and the place is clean. But that is not what customers go there for."
Cafe Valencia,Cute Brazilian Cafe and Market with great açaí bowls and hot pastries.
Cafe Valencia,"I enjoyed the cheese bread here. This was my first time trying Brazilian cheese bread and it’s very tasty. Had the ham and cheese little sandwich and they were good.  We also tried the chicken one and it was good. The coffee was good, nothing memorable but good. I had a fresh squeeze orange juice to a company my sandwich. I do recommend for a light snack, breakfast, brunch. Now I think I rather have one of these over ham croissants."
Cafe Valencia,"it’s unfortunately just okay. I was lucky enough to get cheese bread fresh out of the oven - for $2, this was incredible. I wish I had gotten 2! I also tried the coxinha and quibe (fried dumplings). the chicken one was good, but not great. the beef was not my favorite. both weren’t warm enough.  I’d say worth going for just the cheese bread if you can get them fresh. my friends said they tried the coffee & smoothies and weren’t impressed."
Cafe Valencia,Brazilian pastries! All delicious! Hot mocha! Very good flavor! Acai smoothie! Employees are very nice!
Cafe Valencia,"Very nice Brazilian café, has great acai bowls.  Brazilian snack, coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. Also cool Brazilian brand groceries there. from savory to sweets.""try it, you might like it """
Cafe Valencia,"The place is nice and comfortable, thr service is good, fast and clean, but the food wasn't good, thr coxinha was hard and tasteless, others stuff that we tried was like the same, but what really impressed us was the price, 6.25 a coxinha and other types was too much, if was fresh ok, because we understand that the location might be expensive, but not justify the price, special because the coxinha was hard and not fresh."
Cafe Valencia,Great coffee and açai bowl 🥣.  Awesome cheese 🧀 bread balls. Friendly staff. …
Cafe Valencia,"Paradise on earth for Brazilians living in sao Francisco. This is a small market and caffee. You can find all kinds of delicious Brazilian goods like goiabada, requeijao, bis, Bono, passatempo, Guarana, and more. There are also 'salgados' ready and frozen: coxinha, pao de queijo, kibe, etc."
Cafe Valencia,"That place u Will Never be tired about, great atmosphere, great food and for 5 stars happy and friendly staff"
Cafe Valencia,"This is a great secret spot for a delicious açaí bowl! It got recommended by a friend as a true and authentic bowl and it was so delicious! The owner is lovely and the portion is huge, we shared a bowl. Go check it out :)"
Cafe Valencia,"The coffee is excellent, clean and super polite and smiley staff. They will help you with any question about the food! really good coffee!"

Cafe Valencia,"Really good Brazilian coffee and baked goods, combined with a super kind owner. Will definitely be back!"
Cafe Valencia,Just had a coxinha from this place and it was amazing!!!! Sooooo good. The dough was soft and buttery yet crunchy on the outside. Whatever the chicken and cream cheese mixture that was inside was heavenly. Highly recommend getting yourself one of these puppies. Will be going back.
Cafe Valencia,Top acai bowl in the city. Large portion too. Highly recommend
Cafe Valencia,"I love little Brazilian places like these. The acai was delicious and fresh. It's a bit pricey, but worth it on occasion. They also have various Brazilian foods that remind folks of home or trips there. You can find Guarana here. No Antarctica beer yet, though!"
Cafe Valencia,"After coming here for several years I can say this place is being under a wonderful management! Friendly staff, high variety of Brazilian brands, pastries and drinks."
Cafe Valencia,"Got a small cup of coffee in this clean ministore. The Brazilian flag kind of made me want to come in, in search of distinction. 2 nice ladies with assumsbly Brazilian accents (not dramatically contrived) welcomed me very well. I wasn't here for a meal, but the coffee simply is just plain status quo."
Cafe Valencia,"9/29/2018. I was not welcomed in this place. There was a blond woman with a mad face at the cashier. I grabbed a few things to pay and asked to use the restroom. The woman  looked at me and said. "" restroom is only for customers "" excuse me?? I am buying stuff here  so I believe I am a customer. Then she pointed to the door where the restroom was. Not even once she smile. Horrible customer service. I am planning on NEVER go back to that store. There is no much grocery left to buy and prices are outrageous. Anyways.. good luck if you go there. I definitely won't."
Cafe Valencia,Best açai bowl I’ve ever had!! I came here three days in a row. Definitely a hidden gem.
Cafe Valencia,"I enjoyed my visit to this small but beautiful market. The entrance looks small but it's pretty spacious inside. You can find the typical Brazilian food here: pão de queijo, beijinho, cajuzinho, etc. Marcos is very friendly, we talked about the current events in Brazil and he encouraged me to visit the country. I purchased one beijinho, very tasty!"
Cafe Valencia,"Service is always friendly and they have very good acai bowls. My toddler loves the baked goods, especially the chicken empada."
Cafe Valencia,"If Brazil is your thing, then this place is for you! Staff is very friendly and it seems that 90% of the people that walk in speak portuguese.  Coffee was pretty bad though which is sad because the coffee I got in Brazil was amazing."

Cafe Valencia,"This place changed owners so many times...and always get worst..iam Brazilian and I miss my home food but this is not the place to go..not too many options,expired food,CRAZY prices (3,50 for a brigadeiro!!!) the açaí portion is a JOKE (sidewalk has MUCH better açai)pão de queijo is always not cooked right (is not so hard they are frozen they just stick them on the tiny oven and still they manage to f.up..if you want GOOD Brazilian food try “cafe de casa” close to fisherman wharf.."
