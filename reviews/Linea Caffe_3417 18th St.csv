Linea Caffe,"A lovely stop! The cashier and barista were kind, helpful and efficient. We ordered an espresso, two drip coffees and the everything pastry with cream cheese. The drinks were very good. Espresso was balanced and delicious, as was the drip coffee.  The pastry was from a local bakery and we found it a little soggy, but we appreciated that they had a food option since we were road tripping."
Linea Caffe,"Their oat matcha latte was delicious! I got it without being sweetened, and it was so good. The baristas were super friendly and helpful. They have a point system, so I will def be returning! I did not try their pastries, but they looked delicious!"
Linea Caffe,"It's great coffee and they have some nice pastries. Currently (spring 2023) you can't go inside and you have to order through a window while most places are open. So there's no place really to sit. Maybe there's one two seat bench outside but it's un protected.  Last time I got a pistachio raspberry croissant, but it was dried up and stale :-("
Linea Caffe,The coffee is delicious but the young lady working at the front was extremely rude. I will not return.
Linea Caffe,"I hate paying $4+ for coffee….. BUT, I will gladly shell out for a macchiato at Linea.  In fact, the first one  was so delicious, got a second AND one to take to my buddy. Linea only pulls ristretto espresso shots. The baristas were very knowledgeable, patient and engaging…. the whole experience was great! Skip Starbucks or Peet’s and invest at Linea…. You might even compare them to your go to coffee shop. If you’re on 18th street and need a pick me up, head over to Linea (between Valencia and Mission)"
Linea Caffe,"Really good espresso. Just a couple benches outside for seating, but in my few times visiting, they’re mostly available. On the pricier side but worth it for coffee snobs like myself"
Linea Caffe,"This place is so lovely, and makes for the perfect start to the day. I was having a really rough morning, but the team here helped out and cheered me up. We are so lucky to have a place like this in the community ❤️."
Linea Caffe,"Are you ready to be cheated? Then head on into Linea Coffee Roasting. $5 cup of burnt, too cold, stale coffee in a 10oz cup. So many other fine choices nearby to choose from next time."
Linea Caffe,"Outstanding, some of the best coffee in one of the best coffee cities on earth. Beans are expensive but worth it, service was bottlenecked at first but then got moving, and everyone was friendly."
Linea Caffe,"Unique locally roasted coffee, fast service and savory pastries offered. Oatly Oat milk is even offered here! This is not the coffee shop you sit and hang out in, however there are a few outdoor tables if the weather permits. If you’re just looking for a brilliant coffee rather than an inviting coffee house experience, this is definitely worth the trip."
Linea Caffe,$7 for a mocha. Unconscionable. $4.50 for the same drink at Fayes a few blocks away. I get that this is San Francisco but even we have our limits.
Linea Caffe,"Incredibly friendly staff, nice spot to sit outside, and lovely cups, but coffee (both cappuccino and cold brew) weren’t great. A little disappointed by the flavour."
Linea Caffe,"Had been meaning to visit for a long long time (it's hard when you don't live in town), and Linea was marvelous! Surprisingly snug, not much sitting space, but beautiful cafe experience. Amazing ceramics by Heath, extraordinary La Marzocco machine (a new KB90, as it happens), other quiet details that are impressive and subdued at the same time. You can take a seat outside and enjoy a pleasant corner of the Mission. You can chat with your barista too, who is sure to get just what you're looking for and offer clear expertise. Makes the delicious coffee (espresso refreshingly reminiscent of Italian style, deep and rich without the harsh burn and bitterness) that much sweeter. Also, thanks to barista Ryan!"
Linea Caffe,Best cappuccino I have had in a very long time. The staff was very courteous l. Would come again every time I am nearby.
Linea Caffe,"Fantastic decaf beans. Actually probably the best decaf beans I’ve ever purchased. If people are not familiar with it, most decaf happens through a chemical treatment which is not natural a lot of the time. The Swiss water process helps preserve the integrity of even whole beans without compromising the natural status or organic status of the beans. This is really important for those of us who enjoy the flavor of coffee and like pairing it with dessert or food without the psychological/physiological repercussions. I’ve actually never even had Swiss water process microlot coffee. Thank you Linea for giving us in the niche decaf market a stellar option!"
Linea Caffe,Little Wing is the best espresso blend in SF
Linea Caffe,"This is lovely place! They're able to make an amazing  tea and coffee! Very big assortment of tea! Stuff is really cool, too. Come on in, you won't regret!"
Linea Caffe,"Best latte I've had in the Mission, and I've tried pretty much all of them."
Linea Caffe,Great chai! The right amount of sweetness and spiciness if you like the extra kick!
Linea Caffe,"Visited here for at least the fifth time on 10/22 in the afternoon to grab some of their delicious beans. However, was greeted by an extremely unpleasant gentleman who clearly didn’t want to be there. Really ruined the experience for me, especially at almost $30 for a 10oz bag of beans."
Linea Caffe,"This little spot has fantastic coffee. You will generally see a small line during peak hours - don’t be scared, it moves quickly. Coffee and espresso are incredible. They also serve pastries and treats from local spots. I got a gluten free donut from Dynamo Donuts and it was great with my cold brew. Yum! Will be back regularly!"
Linea Caffe,Great coffee! Friendly staff! Options for oat and almond milk. Plus you can get seats outside enjoying coffee with sunlight.
Linea Caffe,"Dang good shot of espresso! Their house Reserve is delicious and the baristas were friendly. Tried a few other local roasters, but this is the spot for me."
Linea Caffe,"A third-wave coffee spot focused on traditional espresso drinks with high quality beans. I don't give them 5 starts because while the espresso quality is comparable to Ritual Roasters down the street, they don't do any pour overs and only do a batch brew which is not great if you like well made black coffee. They serve Neighbor Bakehouse treats which is quite nice and do sell their owns beans which were very well roasted."
Linea Caffe,"Strong coffee. They have fresh pastries available daily, however they sell out early. This place converted to outdoor window order and pick-up only during the pandemic."
Linea Caffe,"it’s as though the kind owner of Linea, Andrew, curated the espresso, the eco-friendly storefront vibes, and the brilliant climate in San Francisco. 10/5 recommend"
Linea Caffe,"Their coffee is so good, one of the best I have had in this area (or anywhere, for that matter). Definitely recommend buying some beans to brew at home..."
Linea Caffe,"Coffee was good, vibes were off. A bit pricier, and their beans are like 25 to 30 dollars for 10oz. I’m still glad that I tried it, but I don’t think I’ll be coming back."
Linea Caffe,"I ordered a latte to go today, and went to take my first sip—the lid wasn’t put on correctly and the drink then spilled down onto my top and lap and the table, drenching my clothing in coffee—and worse, burning my skin. They gave me a towel to clean up. Eventually, as I cleaned, they offered to refund me—but they only refunded the drink, and did not refund the tip I’d given them earlier, when I paid. I don’t care about an extra two bucks or whatever; I just thought it was super obnoxious to not refund the entire amount I paid. I’ve not been a lawsuit type person, but if they burn someone else who is, they might run into some trouble. I hope not because it is a cute small biz."
Linea Caffe,This is one of my favorites coffee shops in town! Everyone here in this coffee shop goes above and beyond to make sure the costumers were satisfied during their stay. They also have a very delectable cookie which is perfect for pairing with their coffees at a very affordable price. This coffee shop is really perfect! Highly recommended!
Linea Caffe,"Great coffee, on par with many of the better cafes in SF.  Great chocolate chunk cookies.  Seating inside is very limited."
Linea Caffe,Decent coffee spot in the Mission.
Linea Caffe,"As always everything was amazing!!  Steaks were cooked perfectly; knife went thru them like butter. Our server, Donna, was very attentive, friendly and made our dining experience memorable."
Linea Caffe,Very okay-okay. Got a cappuccino here a couple weeks ago and it was more a flat white than a cappuccino. More milk than coffee. Espresso drinks can really vary from day to day so you can take this with a grain of salt if this is the only cafe within range.
Linea Caffe,Cute corner neighborhood cafe with garage feel. Good service. Nitro cold brew is no longer offered so we tried the regular cold brew; very floral and distinct flavor. Espresso latte was not as bold as I had hoped.
Linea Caffe,"The coffee here is amazing. My last two espresso purchases have been here and every time I stop by, the coffee is roasted within a day or two. I prefer Linea's choice of beans and roasting profiles to others in the city. It tends to be less bright and closer towards a traditional roast without going too dark."
Linea Caffe,HI Brandon Thanks! Glad to hear you enjoyed!
Linea Caffe,Quality coffee on this small corner store with curbside pick up. There is a small bench for two that you can sit. You can also  walk few blocks to Dolores Park or stroll Valencia Street with your coffee.
Linea Caffe,"Surely I've reviewed this before,  Google Maps?  Anyway,  good place for coffee. I stand in line here four days a week. You can't go inside,  just order from the window. Heck of responsible. Also, the coffee is good."
Linea Caffe,"I don’t know, maybe their drip is okay, but their espresso is as bitter and rude as the barista who told me he could not make a short/ristretto espresso shot, in a condescending tone and glance. Then he made it (what seemed like) purposely lungo. No sweetness at all, just a bitter, acidic, sharp, crema-less experience. Which is exactly the opposite of what espresso should be. Didn’t even take a picture because it took me ten hours to drink the 40 gallon espresso/ urine/sulphuric acid shot they gave me, and I was effing tired."
Linea Caffe,Cute cafe with amazing coffee!  Best coffee I've had so far in SF.
Linea Caffe,"I didn't quite stumble upon this cafe but rather I met the owner Andrew at a coffee-tasting event who gave me a couple of complimentary cards to try their coffee. What a generous, lovely gift for an espresso lover like me! My boyfriend and I have no problem whatsoever for the lack of seating here, because we have been to Rome and Tokyo where standing-only espresso drinking is the norm. I love it!  This is now my go-to place for an afternoon pick-me-up. The capuccinis were in ceramic cups (request it if you can for a better espresso tasting experience. Trust me.) instead of the paper cups and the foam and balance of the espresso and milk was just right.  I noticed there was some waffle traffic going on, but we just ate lunch and was only looking for some tasty energy shot. I intend to buy some roasted beans here since they source and roast award winning coffees from the world's top farmers as I learned from the tasting event I attended."
Linea Caffe,"Cute, little place. I had the soufflé waffle which comes with chèvre and chives. It was fluffy, savory, and the flavors worked well together; just be careful because the inside is much hotter than the outside. They serve their espresso drinks in Heath Ceramics mugs which is a plus, local love. Great place to sit in the morning, refuel, and watch the city wake up."
Linea Caffe,"Really good coffee, great selections, nice location. The baristas were super nice!"
Linea Caffe,"The coffee is always great, and they're super dog friendly! They also carry Neighbor Bakehouse pastries, which are great."
Linea Caffe,$8 dollar waffles make the Mill's $4 toast a bargain! I tried the buckwheat and ricotta with honey waffle...it has quality ingredients and takes time to whip up. Taste was light and satisfying for a treat. Not sure it was worth the $$ though. Services was friendly.
Linea Caffe,Love the mocha here and they have an awesome assortment of cool pastries. I also recommend trying their bagels when they have them.
Linea Caffe,"Live nearby, love getting morning americanos or lattes from Linea! The staff is always very sweet and this place is well-loved by others around here, though I miss Christian who moved away. (No idea how there are so many reviews from bots recently though lol)"
Linea Caffe,best quality coffee I ever tasted. A unique place to sip a morning coffee.
Linea Caffe,Thank you Den for the kind words and positive review! Glad you enjoyed your Linea coffee!
Linea Caffe,Edit: no more waffle sandwiches here??! All outdoor seating so can be a nice place to drink/relax with your pooch. They also use Heath Ceramics for their dishes and cups which is always nice.
Linea Caffe,I'd had a coffee tasting at work by folks from Línea and it was such an awesome experience. I went to the coffee shop last week Thursday after lunch and the lady that waited on us ruined the visit for me. Short in her responses and so disinterested in speaking with me about anything. Please don't let her be the representative of this brand.
Linea Caffe,Delicious waffles and coffee. No indoor seating unfortunately. Outdoor seating is limited and very sunny. High recommended for both special sweet and savory waffles. Coffee is good.
Linea Caffe,"Linea Caffe is a very friendly cafe that popped up on 18th. The menu has an answer for both the sweet and savory appetites. I recommend the straight up Brussels style waffle with maple syrup for the sweet and the Brown rice salad for the savory. I had not had AeroPress coffee before and it's a nice treat. At $3+, this is not a spot to get a casual coffee. Know what you're getting into and be ready to pay for the quality of ingredients. If you're lucky enough to be outside on a sunny weekday afternoon in the Mission you should stop by!"
Linea Caffe,Espresso and drip coffee were great. The barista was very knowledgeable and friendly and the wait time for my drinks was very short.
Linea Caffe,"I was there july 22nd, a Sunday. An American expresso has the double shot for 3.75. I was asked if i wanted 10 oz. Or 8 oz. Cup.  Typically,  it's one shot for an 8 oz. Coffee was bitter. Not floral. Not nutty, not woody. I didn't sense any freshness.  Just strong coffee. Did it work?  Mnnahhh. I've levitated an inch off my chair, once before somewhere else,  another time. But i remain hopeful wherever i go,  when i can.  Folgers still does a good job. No restroom here. Still, a coffee place here is better than no coffee place."
Linea Caffe,Great no-nonsense coffee shop that is super user-friendly. There weren’t any lines when we came. This is a perfect spot for a quick pick-me-up as you continue your exploration of the Mission District.
Linea Caffe,"Even though they’re known for their espresso, I ordered the coffee. My cup of Ethiopian guji coffee was watery and the borders of my tongue picked up a touch of tang that made it curl. My friend made a similar remark about her ice coffee. However, the beans are supposed to be lemony and fruity, but I’m not a fan. The hot chocolate is supposed to be a drinking chocolate but it was grainy and gritty like sand. It was pretty terrible and undrinkable.  The buckwheat waffle came with crème fraiche, cucumber, and salmon roe. The waffle was crisp on the outside and soft and airy inside. The roe was sweet and briny and it blew me away because it was damn tasty for a savory waffle.  The Belgium waffle simply came with Maple syrup. When I went to pick it up I wondered if the chef had forgotten the butter or whip cream so I stood there stupidly waiting until the chef kindly let me know that I could take my dish. Like the buckwheat waffle, it was crispy outside, but just airy inside which produced a crunch like bite. It soaked up the Maple syrup wonderfully and I realized that it was good enough that you really didn’t need that extra fluff. It’s not what I image a Belgium waffle to be like but I’m impressed with their version and would gladly order it again.  They’re suppose to change their coffee frequently so I’m willing to try another cup but you should definitely come here for their amazing waffles."
Linea Caffe,"Delicious coffee, friendly people."
Linea Caffe,"Verve, Ritual, Four Barrel, and Sightglass get more attention, but those in-the-know go to Linea. Best specialty coffee in San Francisco, hands down.  (CV: former barista competitor, 8 years spent at 4+ roasters in the specialty coffee industry)"
Linea Caffe,Coffee is always good and the staff is super friendly.
Linea Caffe,"Linea has been on my list of best coffee places to visit. I visited and Linea did not disappoint! One of the best, way way way near the top of my list now! They care about high quality coffee as much as I do. SO worth a visit!"
Linea Caffe,"Hi Ken, thanks for the positive feedback! Glad to hear you enjoyed!"
Linea Caffe,"Cool, tucked away coffee spot. Dig the Heath Ceramics cups, and the waffles were really awesome though they are no longer served. Always great service!"
Linea Caffe,Great coffee. And the friendliest service. Shoutout to the guy who served us this morning… service with a smile!
Linea Caffe,"Good coffee, a few tables outside on the sidewalk. No space to sit inside so better for takeaway or a sunny day. Don't expect very friendly service (but that's fine with me)."
Linea Caffe,"Great coffee, however the seating isn't that great."
Linea Caffe,I have tried just about every coffee shop in SF and this is truly the best espresso. It’s maybe the best espresso I’ve ever had.
Linea Caffe,"Excellent coffee, Andrew is a superb roaster and the expresso is superb. Salads and waffles are very good as well. Not cheap, but super quality."
Linea Caffe,"Great for espresso drinks. Expensive though. No coffee. Minimal space (few tables. Small), and minimal menu.  Friendly and worth checking out at least once!"
Linea Caffe,Andrew's little corner of heaven after building some of the most renowned coffee businesses in the Bay Area. A community sleeper that deals up amazing coffee consistently.
Linea Caffe,Thanks for the kind words Dana! Glad you enjoyed!
Linea Caffe,My favourite local specialty coffee shop in San Francisco by a mile! Love the friendly staff and the delicious cup of coffee I get every time.
Linea Caffe,Hi Miku - Thank you for your positive review of Linea. Glad you enjoyed. It's a pleasure serving you!

Linea Caffe,Can’t say enough about how good this coffee is and how incredible the service is. This place is amazing! Lydia made our day 💕 …
Linea Caffe,"If I could, I'd rate this place as a zero. First time I stopped in they were out of all snacks. So I walked back from where I came to get a snack. I walked back to get a mocha and the barista tells me that their out of chocolate. SoS place!!"
Linea Caffe,Solid coffee - great bean selection
Linea Caffe,Really good coffee drinks and beans. Plus very tasty pastries!
Linea Caffe,"Great cortanado, best I've had in SF.  My wife said best macha in SF.  Alternative milks available."

Linea Caffe,"[#IldoC View]  Linea coffee S.F. San Francisco Magazine's Espresso Spot  Coffee legend Andrew Barnett selected it as the Best 11 Indie Coffee in 2013. Due to the restrained acidity, it may have popularity, but there is a sense of distance from the style these days. Still, that's what makes it even more attractive.  Anyway, the quality of the store is enhanced with a few pieces of paper made of letters and photos at the door. As a consumer, it makes the quality shared. If there was no paper, there would be nothing to go in, no order to order espresso, and no need to concentrate.  All it takes is a few sheets of paper"
Linea Caffe,"Exe place you ask for your orders by cell phone. When you arrive they put this on you, take off"
Linea Caffe,Very good
Linea Caffe,A. Friend. It. Visit I presume. Is very. Okay.
Linea Caffe,Killer cut!!
