Schilling & Co Cafe,It was a pleasant surprise when I found this place in Chinatown. Super cute interior and superb food! It’s a perfect place for Sunday brunch. And it was not even crowded on Sunday. The circular French toast was one of the best I’ve tasted. Will definitely come back.
Schilling & Co Cafe,"Wow I’m very impressed with this exceptional brunch!  It was surprisingly filling and super tasty.  Yes, it’s pricey but very well worth it!  Super friendly staff as well!!"

Schilling & Co Cafe,"If you want to have a quality breakfast, go there! Super friendly staff. Nice selection of teas (loose) served in a nice Tea pot. my Florentine was delicious, the hollandaise sauce was not too heavy, the bread soft, the eggs cooked perfectly! The place is spotless, more locals than tourists.  I will definitely come back on  my next trip."
Schilling & Co Cafe,Fabulous breakfast find. The best brioche French toast. As a European travelling in the US I am always delighted to find a decent cup of coffee too - sensible sized pottery mug and great tasting! Very friendly service and kindly filled our water bottles. Tucked away but worth seeking out.
