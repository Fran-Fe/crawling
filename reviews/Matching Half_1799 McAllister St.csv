Matching Half,"Great coffee shop! Everything here seems very home made. They make their own oat milk, and seems like the yogurt as well.  Cozy and yummy! I would definitely return here."
Matching Half,Lot of people come in and work here. Nice spot! Cappuccino and muesli bowl were amazing.
Matching Half,Stopped for an iced Latte on the go. A few customers waiting on one girl making the coffees who felt the need to have a 10 min conversation with a customer about her housing struggles.. at least learn to multi-task if you like to chat.  Coffee was decent but wouldn’t return. Staff weren’t overly friendly and moved very slow.
Matching Half,"Pretty sweet little place I've been visiting for about a year. They definitely make the best drinks around.  I was pretty bummed this morning, though, when I ordered my usual breve cappuccino in my own tiny cup and discovered that apparently they've raised the prices because it was $6 for a 6oz drink!  I think upcharge prices for beverages with milk alternatives should most certainly be dependent upon the size of the drink.  Wouldn't you agree that a 12 oz upcharge should not cost the same as a 6 oz upcharge?  Anyway, I might have to reconsider where I frequent for my drinks now, because that feels unreasonable."
Matching Half,Great local neighborhood coffee shop serving up Andytown Coffee Roasters coffee and Midwife & Baker pastries along with some kitchen fare as well. We just moved into the neighborhood so we frequented several times in our first couple of days while we unpacked. Coffee is solid and service is great. Cute atmosphere and definitely feels like a community hub and connector.
Matching Half,A super lovely neighborhood coffee shop plus a great place to work on the laptop. The WiFi is reliable. The staff is super friendly too. I got the honey and cinnamon latte and wow 🤩  Would love to go back there for another round of deep work and have the lox bagel 🥯
Matching Half,"I ordered Walnut caprese toast and I really loved it, it had a pesto spread. I was expecting it to be a very small portion but I was wrong, it was worth every penny with a very decent portion to fill you up and very tasty and fresh, you feel so positive after eating it. The hint of black pepper in it makes it very interesting. Loved it. Also ordered banana bread and it was perfect, just felt that it was a bit costly but that's fine.  Also ordered latte and it was great. My friend ordered drip coffee and he is kind of a coffee connoisseur and he approves of it. My friend ordered salami ciabbata and he liked that too."
Matching Half,Great experience at Matching Half! Has to be one of my favorite coffee shops in San Francisco. Our barista Sarah was really kind and even said a funny joke that made the whole place giggle! Love the environment!
Matching Half,"Great location and decor, but the hot drinks were not hot enough, and the barista/manager's attitude was not very welcoming. Some of the other employees were friendly and made up for it. Despite these issues, I would still recommend the shop, but improvements to the hot drinks and customer service would make the experience even better."
Matching Half,Nice breakfast/coffee spot. Staff is always friendly. Price isnt too expensive considering the car area.
Matching Half,"Got the Triple Berry Muesli bowl with peanut butter and bananas! Oowee! It was amazing, full of taste and great way to wake up. Wifi + outlets are a great added bonus."
Matching Half,"Really nice local spot with an amazing almond latte and coffee cake. Charming, quieter space, perfect for studying or working. WiFi connection could be better though."
Matching Half,Grab coffee here almost everyday - not sure what it is but they have the best tasting coffee in the neighborhood. Very cute shop and kind baristas.
Matching Half,"I tried to get coffee here because it looks like they make a decent flat white (from what I can tell from the pictures). Went in on a quiet Thursday morning, smiled at the two people behind the counter but was completely ignored. I stood there for another what felt like 10min (probably more like 2 or 3 minutes) without anyone looking at me, let alone saying hello or asking what I’d like order. They just went about doing what they were doing which was cleaning the coffee machine and restocking. I left and had a coffee at Automat, just across the street. I saw a few others have complained about the slow and unfriendly service here. Sadly, I can confirm."
Matching Half,"My local spot! I love this place, they have some of the best matcha around, among a menu where basically everything is great. I usually just stop by to get some Andytown beans and a pastry.  They get pretty crowded on weekend mornings, so it can take a while to get food orders, so keep that in mind!"
Matching Half,"Best stinkin’ dirty chai in the west. Incredibly nice baristas who greet their regulars by name, charming interior (reopening Feb 15 for those wondering!), and delicious pastries too."
Matching Half,"The cutest, warmest and heartiest cafe in this part of the hood for sure. Low key, unassuming yet great little breakfast and party bites, plus home made granola, sandwiches (the bread is bomb!) and oh, the dopest matcha latte."
Matching Half,"It's a cozy place, and beverages are nice. Especially their coffee is good because of using Sightglass's beans. However, their WiFi is so slow. Therefore, I think if you want to use a laptop there, I can't recommend there."
Matching Half,First time here for a quick latte and they delivered with excellent service and fantastic latte! Will definitely be back for more. Photo shows the latte I got with a bit of cinnamon and just the right amount of honey infused.
Matching Half,"A beautiful cafe serving Andytown coffee. During Covid, they have really nice outdoor seating (actually they had outdoor seating pre-pandemic as well). Other than excellent coffee, they also make a delicious matcha latte with oatmilk."
Matching Half,"Local corner coffeeshop serving delicious coffee from Andytown coffee and assorted pastries. Friendly staffs, good ambiance and nice outdoor seating."
Matching Half,"This is my local coffee shop, a great cafe for a professional 1:1 or working. I like the coffee here, but don’t love the food. My British roommate loves that they’ll serve a flat white! The breakfast sandwich is okay, but takes 10 mins to prepare, and I think the ones made at the corner store across the street are tastier. The tables are a little close together and it’s quiet inside, so not a good place for a private conversation or date."
Matching Half,"Some of the best coffee in San Francisco. They actually do a great flat white! They also have oat, soy and almond milk for a good non-dairy variety."
Matching Half,Love this place as a neighborhood spot! Welcoming staff and great vibe in the cafe
Matching Half,"Came in, stood near the counter No greeting or sign the staff knew we were there Waited Barista finished a coffee and called the customer's name, then went straight back to making coffees without acknowledging us Made eye contact with the other server, nothing Waited Got sick of waiting, left  On the plus side, decor is nice and I've heard coffees are good, when you can get service..."
Matching Half,"Really good coffee, nice chill atmosphere. They do a good bagel and serve beer and wine later in the day which is a bonus."
Matching Half,Great and cozy neighborhood cafe for sandwiches and toasts. Coffee is not the best quality around here. I like to come here for work so I don't mind that much.
Matching Half,Yum! Friendly staff that offered to remake my drink after an error on my side. Great selection of breakfast options for this cozy and sophisticated caffe. My dog enjoyed the outdoor seating as well!
Matching Half,Never come here. They’re Always out of bagels. Not that difficult to prepare accordingly 😂 get a new stock manager. …
Matching Half,"I used to live in the area and matching half was my local. I recently moved back, and am infuriated to see the obvious decline in service. I waited over 30min for a simple cappuccino. While I understand it’s a small neighborhood establishment, it can be run much more efficiently. I strongly recommend the manager patron other small coffee shops in the city, observing how they maximize space for operational efficiency, and optimally utilize their staff. The staff also deliver a subpar experience at best, but I’m sure it’s a result of the stress they’re under. Regardless poor experience overall. I will be taking my business to The Mill and Automat."
Matching Half,In the mood for a tasty coffee beverage in a quaint environment with great service?  This is your place.  Serving Andytown coffee roasters
Matching Half,I got the turmeric latte and it was perfect temperature! Also slightly sweet from honey.  But the bagel sandwich with avocado and boiled egg left me disappointed. The bagel was stale and didn’t feel like $1.50 for cream cheese was worth it.  Cute neighborhood place with great coffee but average food.
Matching Half,"Went with a friend; ordered a pour-over, a latte, and two breakfast sandwiches on bagels. The coffees were decent, but the breakfast sandwiches were quite literally the worst we had ever eaten.  The bagels were stale to the point of not being chewable anymore, and the cheese was either of poor quality, or expired, or both.  Overall, an incredibly disappointing experience for $29."
Matching Half,"Been here a few times.  Once the ice machine was broken, so an “iced latte” became a lukewarm half-full cup of milk and coffee.  On another occasion, they didn’t add the right milk to my drip coffee.  Food is priced high and mediocre at best.  Overall - cute shop, good location, but look elsewhere if you actually want some coffee."
Matching Half,The owners and staff here are super nice. Coffee is excellent and they have small food like pastries and bagels. Coffee is less expensive than the Mill. Tabels are usually full when I've been there. On nice days they have some tables outside. My only complaint is that it can be slow to get your coffee.
Matching Half,"Coffee and food are great, but there's nowhere to charge your phone or laptop. I'd have tipped more and purchased more to stay longer if I didn't have to leave to charge devices.  If you don't need to plug in devices, it's a nice place to sit and work: popular, but quiet, and there's usually a place to sit during the afternoon.  Good for a light meal."
Matching Half,"One of my favorite little spots in town. Excellently executed espresso, and coffee. Delicious bites (like the home made pop tarts!!) and the staff here is always sooo good! I also love how relaxing the environment is. Always hearing good music, and good laughs."
Matching Half,"I needed a place to spend some time working/reading with sustenance. Perfect.  The menu is reasonably priced, the “ham and pickle” sandwich is delicious, the coffee well done and what’s not to like about (4) different $5 drafts when my work was complete.  I’ll be back the next time I’m in town.  And great light!"
Matching Half,"This place has very good coffee and some decent coffee cake, but what really stands out are the pop tarts. They're homemade and very flaky and they heat them up for you so they're warm. The banana one is worth coming back for - I have several times - but haven't yet worked up the courage to try the jalapeno..."
Matching Half,The stars are for the everything besides the drip coffee. Wonderful service. Great people. The batch brew is plain terrible. Watered down and weak. I share this only because I frequent this establishment often and hope to see their success in the future.
Matching Half,"I guess I got unlucky, I see a lot of reviews of excellent service but that was not the case with me. I only tipped hoping it would go to the person making the coffee, not that guy that “helped me” and when I say helped I mean barely said anything to me and gave me a lot of attitude at any question I had. Owner maybe? Did not seem like someone in the field of hospitality. And the coffee didn’t make up for it either."
Matching Half,"Great staff, coffee and food! But with only one espresso machine, it seems like you can’t get an espresso drink in under 10 minutes. Most days it takes 15 minutes to get one, which is disappointing."
Matching Half,This is a nice coffee shop in western addition with a local feel. The $2.50 coffee of the day is decent and does the job to wake you up. If you want to come here to get some work done on your laptop however make sure you got plenty of battery. They turned off all the outlets in the common areas to keep folks from spending their day in there. I get they need to make money but would be better just to charge an hourly rate for laptop warriors to camp there. I will return but not too soon as there are plenty of other coffee shops to go and be productive at.
Matching Half,"Great local coffee spot. The crowd is always super relaxed, reading on working in their computers. You can just stay there and they won't try to kick you out.  Also, the pastries are amazing, specially the banana bread."
Matching Half,Love this place. Amazing turmeric latte and delicious bagel with lox and cream cheese and dill. My favorite place to go for coffee in SF.
Matching Half,Cute coffee shop with some light food options in case you need a snack/light meal. Outdoor seating is fantastic and great corner without too much car or foot traffic.
Matching Half,"We got lattes this morning at Matching Half. It might be one of the worst lattes I have ever had. The flavor was like burnt flowers. With almost no line, you wouldnt expect a latte to take 20+ min to make. Additionally, the staff were morose and borderline rude. Perhaps it was just a bad Sunday, but I will never come back when I can go to Mill right down the street."
Matching Half,"Great coffee and tea options, and some hearty bagel sandwiches. No restroom available though, probably covid protocol. Need to go to lucky grocery or the panhandle to use bathroom."
Matching Half,Great cafe with a very zen vibe. I had an excellent latte here. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and also serve wine and beer. Lots of light inside from several large windows. WiFi available and the staff are friendly.
Matching Half,"This is the perfect neighborhood cafe – though there's not much foot traffic at McAllister and Baker, it's always filled. Why? Consistent and quality. Coffee is good. Food is way above average. Prices are fair. Nice and clean on the inside, with a patio that gets tons of sun. Plus, the staff is super friendly. Sad to say I'm moving from tha 'hood this week ... I'm going to miss you, Matching Half :*)."
Matching Half,"I've never been to this place for food, but this is my second time during their ""Close Up Comedy"" night. Yes, there is a secret event that you can easily find online now that you know :) Usually what happens is - There will be a line up of about six or seven comedians (usual beginners and amateurs) with various degrees of comic success  - However, that doesn't really matter. For the price of ~$10 you can have a fun night with your friends, enjoying the vibe, decor, the laughs, and the people and it's totally worth it. There are beers and wine that you can buy, candies on the tables and a really great time. The event gains some traction and sales out pretty fast!"
Matching Half,Local favorite coffee shop. Great sunny seats outdoors. Love their yoghurt/ muesli bowls and coffees.
Matching Half,"Nice, small neighborhood cafe. They used to use Sightglass beans, but have apparently switched to a different brand. Doesn't matter much, as the roasts are very similar and the coffee is very good. Parking can be tight, but it's worth the trip!"
Matching Half,Name changes quality stays Seriously gourmet with down the street kitty corner special donuts
Matching Half,"Best Dirty Chai Latte in town. With homemade chai syrup, almond milk, and a triple shot option, Matching Half has my highest praise."
Matching Half,"I'm visiting SF from Portland and staying with a friend who lives a few blocks from Matching Half. It is clearly their neighborhood spot and she and her roommates had only good things to say. They serve Sightglass coffee and some smaller pastries and sandwiches which look fresh and tasty (I only had a cookie). The baristas are so nice! They gave me advice on places to go and how to get around, and when I came back a few days later they remembered me and asked me how my walk was, and if I had any luck at the hat shop they recommended. I definitely recommend this place for the product, service, and atmosphere."
Matching Half,"Super cute cafe near Alamo square that I stopped in to get a beer. Nice IPA selection and great vibes, Very chill with great service. A lot of folks in there hanging out after work to soak up the good energy."
Matching Half,"Quick and friendly service. You can tell this place makes for a great hang out spot (they have some outdoor seating) and it looks like a lot of people take advantage of the free wifi to get work done. As for the coffee and food, my first impression was that both are pretty good."
Matching Half,"5 star caffeine, 4 star food (tasty but small portions, bacon egg cheese ciabatta is great), 1 star for potential 40 minute wait times."
Matching Half,"One of my favorite spots in the city! Excellent coffee + sandwiches, super nice staff, and plenty of outdoor seating at their parklets. Definitely recommend checking it out."
Matching Half,I’ve never seen somebody make a $10 bacon egg & cheese so slow in my life
Matching Half,Breakfast egg sandwich was made just right. Delicious! Latte was perfect with espresso flavor shining through.
Matching Half,Neat little coffee shop nestled in a San Francisco neighborhood not for from the Haight and Ashbury district. I stopped in to have a half cafe on the way to my brother's place and it was delicious. Nice spot to meet others or post up with a book or laptop.
Matching Half,Cortado was decent. Andytown roast. Nice vibe and people are friendly.
Matching Half,"The most lovely neighborhood cafe. They host comedy nights, art sales, and restaurant pop ups from time to time. I love each and every person who works here. They brighten my day every time I visit. I’d recommend getting a chai, a veggie bagle, and the kale salad then sit outside and watch the whole neighborhood filter throw. Everyone stops by matching half at some point. Also check out the hand made mugs and saucers made my Reese (one of the baristas)."
Matching Half,"Great little cafe. The food is delicious and so is the coffee. The seating is hard to get, but it's worth the wait if you need to.  The place is pretty clean. There is a restroom available for customers."
Matching Half,Lovely little spot with fantastic pastries and great coffee. I love that they use handmade ceramics for all of their drinks. It adds a little something special to the experience ☺️
Matching Half,"Love this cute neighborhood coffee spot. They have Sightglass coffee and delish Blackjet bakery treats. SO glad to have this place in our neighborhood.  Also, looks like they have wine, too! May have to visit in the evenings."
Matching Half,"Some of the employees were a bit rude (although couple of them were lovely!), but the pastries/food options were good, as well as the coffee. Good option if you're in the area and in need of a little somethin-somethin"
Matching Half,My pour over was made with luke warm water and my blueberry muffin was completely flat and dense which they said were normal. Will not be returning....
Matching Half,"Food is pretty good. Great outdoor and indoor seating. I only had their iced coffee, but that was pretty good. Strong flavor and caffeine."
Matching Half,"Great local place to relax and have food, drinks, get some work done, or all three! Very friendly staff and lots of good options. Oh, and the desserts are always my favorite!"
Matching Half,"This place has become an institution in the neighborhood. Great place to start your morning, meet a friend, or get some work done. Lattes are the best. Keep your eye out for new art hangings every few months."
Matching Half,"My current favorite cafe in the neighborhood. Simple but tasty salads and sandwiches, made with quality ingredients. Excellent espresso pulls and pour overs."
Matching Half,"The mornings here after 10 is perfection. For me, it's a good start where the music is eclectic and the breakfast sandwiches (egg, avocado, melted cheese) picked me up with a boost. Their cortados are exactly the way it should be made."
Matching Half,Favorite spot in town. It’s always a gorgeous day at Matching Half!
Matching Half,"A local little corner cafe which I always go to when in SF. Great vibe, and they do homemade poptarts! Very good coffee and they also have beers on tap."
Matching Half,"Decent food, relaxed environment, good coffee. Outlets are blacked out, so not a great place to work if you don't have the battery life."
Matching Half,Lovely little local café! It’s my go to neighborhood spot to grab a coffee and read a book. They also have tasty breakfast sammies!
Matching Half,"Slow service because they only do drip coffee. They make homemade pastries that I enjoyed as a kid, although it's very pricey. Great comedy nights"
Matching Half,Beautiful inside and the coffee is fantastic. Great place to grab a cup and read a book. Can get crowded tho and seating is somewhat limited.
Matching Half,"Coffee is amazing. Food is delightful, my girlfriend was a little taken back by the texture of the eggs in the breakfast sandwich, but I still get it often"
Matching Half,"Great place to work from! Outlets, free wifi, nice light, tables, good food."
Matching Half,Surprisingly good food and coffee. Great neighborhood cafe. Always busy. Service is a little slow but I wouldn't go elsewhere because of it.
Matching Half,Love Matching Half. The coffee and breakfast options are excellent. Good sandwiches too. There are outside tables and lots of bike parking too.
Matching Half,"Go here if you want to wait a long time. Took 25 minutes for a coffee, baristas didn’t seem to be in a rush. Won’t be coming back."
Matching Half,Coffee is smoother and more complex than Four Barrel. This is the best espresso I've had in sf. No laptop outlets.
Matching Half,"I love this place and the coffee, however it's hard to get a seat which is frustrating when people are sitting there with laptops and either empty cups or no food/drink. Unfortunately unless it's during the week I end up having to leave because I can't sit."
Matching Half,pleasantly surprised w how good it was. long wait though for a basic drink
Matching Half,Great coffee. Would love to see a slightly more expansive food menu but the coffee is worth the visit.
Matching Half,"The best neighborhood coffee shop. Service is great, drip coffee is delectable, and the mocha is my personal favorite."
Matching Half,"Great place, the yogurt bowl is tasty! Make sure you leave a solid tip!"
Matching Half,"Good service, good coffee, great homemade Pop tarts. They serve beer too. WiFi is weak though."
Matching Half,"A sunny morning, but it’s ruined by the server with attitude, dressed up with dark red dress and earrings. I’m not sure if she’s being discriminate to a Chinese. She’s rude, unprofessional, ruining the brand and the reputation of this cafe."
Matching Half,"I love this coffee shop for its great vibe, friendly, welcoming service, cool clientele and killer coffee. My favorite place for a morning beverage in the city."
Matching Half,"Great coffee, great food, small space.  A victim of its own popularity, the biggest issue is finding a seat to enjoy your meal."
Matching Half,"My favorite neighborhood cafe!  Love the folks, the coffee, and the atmosphere.  The staff is super friendly and helpful."
Matching Half,Really great espresso drinks! Delicious food and great vibe

Matching Half,Cute little coffee shop. Their mocha was great and the pastries looked yummy! Would definitely go back.
Matching Half,Love this sunny cafe! Always a well crafted coffee. Nice snack options.
Matching Half,I like to go here when I have some work or emails to catch up on. It has a relaxed ambiance and the fact that it's right across from Green Chile Kitchen doesn't hurt.
Matching Half,"Courteous and caring service, with very tasty sandwiches, and quite good desserts. Open areas outside."
Matching Half,"Great coffee, but VERY slow service. Don't expect to be in and out in 5 minutes, especially on the weekends."

Matching Half,Great vibes great prices amazing coffee
Matching Half,Lovely food and great coffee. Real nice atmosphere and friendly staff.

Matching Half,Cute cafe with great coffee. Their light breakfast items are delicious too

Matching Half,"Super cute place, great coffee, and amazing vibes!"
Matching Half,"During a two-month stay in San Francisco I had the opportunity to go to this café many times (living 3 minutes away on foot is even easier). What can I say except that the atmosphere is perfect and very relaxing (perfect for working or going from blog to blog), that the service is also top notch with pleasant staff and finally that the chocolates are excellent. The savory dishes are also very good.  In short, it's a real haven of peace where I had a good time every week.  Only downside on the internet connection sometimes saturated (the ransom of success).  Go there you will not be disappointed"
