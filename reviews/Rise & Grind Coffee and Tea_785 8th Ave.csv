Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ritual is a local coffee shop with 3 locations in San Francisco. This is the Haight Street location and is located at the top part of the shopping district, next to a residential area.  Ritual roasts their own coffee beans and had several varieties available to purchase, as well as a small selection of branded t-shirts, nice drinkware, and coffee making supplies.  The interior is minimalist, with 4-5 tables lining the windows and bench seating in the bay window near the door. It’s a narrow space, so seems like it could feed really crowded rather quickly…  The drink menu had the basics (coffee + tea) plus a limited choice of specialty drinks. I got a latte that tasted like a blueberry muffin, which the barista suggested.(They don’t really have food, just a small selection of pastries to accompany your coffee.)  Overall, it seems like a nice place to meet a friend for coffee in the neighborhood."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,This is my favorite cafe. The coffee beans have a wonderful aroma. I also like their iced Americano and iced latte.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great little coffee shop if you’re in the area. It’s kitty corner from Buena Vista Park and right in between Upper and Lower Haight. It can get crowded so I usually try to go odd hours so that I don’t have to wait long. Coffee is great and they have some cool SF merch too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Espresso was not good, very burnt aroma and taste. The donut was delicious. Baristas gave nice service."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The best coffee shop in SF! Make sure you grab a cup, you don’t wanna miss out 😉 …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Delicious coffee, kind baristas. Best proper espresso drinks in the neighborhood by far! Also great place to buy beans for home.  Their seasonal specialty drinks are always fun too, if you want to try something new. I still miss the Keke Palmer, a sparkling iced tea lemonade."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"One of the best local coffee brands in SF (this is just one of their locations). This coffee is notorious in SF, and used in many local mom and pop cafe's as well because it really is great coffee. Make sure if you're visiting SF to make this a must see. Note: A bit strong and deep flavor if that's your thing."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Sit back and unwind from the bustle of the city with high quality coffee and tasty pastries. Places like these make me appreciate a cup of brewed coffee
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee! A good coffee is more about the after taste rather than aroma or the body itself. I got single origin coffee V60 and it tasted like heaven. Rich in aroma and body with an after taste like you did not wanted to eat or drink anything for couple of hours to have the taste on your tongue. Also a good place to work, in the heart of San Francisco. Coffees price range from $5-$6 but definitely worth it!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The coffee here lives up to the San Francisco standard and is a great place to hang around while enjoying a latte. Their espresso machine is vintage so definitely check that out or ask the barista about it (if they're not busy).
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The best coffee we found in our week in the US (actually, the only good coffee) – just as good as back home in Wellington, New Zealand, or in Melboirne."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,They don't always have it but the carrot ginger cake is so good. Also love the Dandelion mocha
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Popped in for a latte whilst doing some Christmas shopping. Nice fit out, chilled vibes and a lovely latte.  Highly amused by barista lamenting all the latte orders - obviously not challenging his creativity! Was tempted to shout “lattes for all” but wimped it.  Would go back if I was in the part of town."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I went here with a couple of people. I got a cappuccino. The second person got a regular coffee. The third person didn't get a drink. We also bought a bag of coffee beans. The drinks were good and the customer service was good too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great hot chocolate. Great for working if you don’t need Wi-Fi or power. Seats were open at their busiest time.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Really good coffee if you’re in the area. Small bites, would be nice if they got a microwave to warm the goods up :). Take a walk around Buena Vista Park while sippin your coffee afterwards!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The coffee is great, but the other drinks like their chai latte taste like nothing."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Love this place. They pay close attention to detail, making sure your drink looks and tastes great while ensuring the temperature is ok too. I appreciate that, because I have buying a coffee and then having you wait for it to cool enough not to burn your mouth. I might be picky, but if you're picky then this is the place for you. You won't be disappointed ☕ 👍"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee ☕!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I’ve had their sweet 16 blend and loved it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Incredible coffee! The staff was very nice and knowledgeble, and their pourover coffee is fantastic.  Great atmosphere to sit, talk, study, or just for takeout."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great local haunt with amazing artisinal coffee drinks and friendly barristas
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Both their hot latte & iced latte somehow lacked flavor. Yet, I know that Ritual is a known roaster with high-quality beans (I've personally bought their beans before), so I think I just got unlucky with the barista. In my opinion, a shop like this has to do better at their high price point."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"They ask that you show proof of vaccination when you tell them you're dining in.. I had an experienced barista make me a nice crafty latte in a ceramic cup for sitting at one of the few tables. From the limited variety of pastries I chose a chocolate croissant. It all came to under $10. It was busy and full the entire time we sat, though not unpleasant."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"When they opened up I thought “wow the last thing we need in SF is another coffee shop selling small lattes for almost $6”. But then I started giving them a chance because I literally live 3 doors up from them. But after today’s extremely rude and hostile interaction with one of the workers who refused to make my usual drink that they have made many times before I will certainly not go back and will urge my friends and neighbors not to go there either. All I asked for was them using half Almond milk and half Soy milk, as all soy is too much soy, and all almond milk doesn’t froth up at when steamed. It’s a great combination for anyone who doesn’t want a dairy milk latte. Everyone there has been accommodating before for this simple request but today the barista decided “we don’t do that”. To which I replied “really? you have many times before”. She went off not even saying, sorry we can’t do it, it’s against company policy to mix milks or whatever her rationale was, she just kept saying “we don’t do that”. But they do! Anyways she conceded and agreed to make the drink, took my money, made the other drink I ordered for my girlfriend, and then at the last second reverted to saying again “we don’t make that, pick one almond milk or soy milk!” Super offended by her abrasive negative attitude and unfriendliness I got a refund and left. With probably about 10 other cafes within a 4 block radius why would I ever go there again and deal with that kind of negativity and lack of customer service? I went up to Gus’s Market (2 blocks away) and they happily made my half soy half almond milk latte."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"$7 mocha that tasted like water and customer service wasn’t great, but the cafe had good vibes"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Nice spot with tons of natural light. Baristas were great and coffee was insanely delicious (albeit a price tag to match). They had oat milk but no wifi which is tragic because I liked hanging around there. So plan to bring a hotspot if you have work to do; I saw at least one outlet, as well."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Obnoxious experience: the baristas play heavy metal non stop. We tried waiting but gave up
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I have been here several times, because the coffee is good but the service is very contrasting compared to other coffee shops. For $7 small coffee you get no Hi, no Thank you for the tips, no oat milk in your coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great mid town Haight Asbury location and service. Good pastries for kids and adults.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Best flat whites in SF and super friendly staff :)
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee but unfriendly staff that treats customers like they have the plague. Unfortunately vibe and mood are as important to me as the coffee.  They removed all of their seating.  Fortunately there are better coffee shops in SF!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Lovely coffee and a friendly team of baristas ❤️ They always have nice music and chill vibes, perfect spot for journaling or catching up with friends. And I’m addicted to their ham and cheese croissants! 🥐"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Writing this review on network because they don’t offer WiFi. If you like your froufrou coffee shop extra smug, look no further. Be prepared to show your vax card, or not. It’s Willy nilly."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Saw the ""best coffee I've ever had in my life review"" so I went. Okay service not great at all coffee, lacked flavor, would not recommend"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"If the barista followed their own suggestion of 17.3g in 32g out in 32sec at 198-200° for the Sweet 16, the espresso I had would have been much better. It was too cold and too acidic for how it should be. I came home and was able to pull a much better shot."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Had takeout, line was long so just got a standard coffee but their standard coffee is really good."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Love this place! Parking is valet only but it's only a short walk from my apartment and there is street parking. They have the best hot almond milk lattes and the best iced vanilla latte I've ever had, it wasn't overly sweet or bitter, perfectly balanced. The food is great too, it tastes fresh and the portions are large. They are super friendly there and have reward stamp cards! The wait is always really short, I get food to go on my lunch breaks and never wait more than ten minutes. One of my favorite coffee stops in ktown!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, terrible online order system. After 15 mins of waiting, asked about status and turns out they don’t start preparing online orders until you ask about them. Completely defeats the point of ordering ahead if you still have to stand in line to ask them to make it. Apparently it is to keep the coffee warm, but I am perfectly capable of timing an order to pick up.  If you’re going to be the only coffee shop in the country that doesn’t start preparing an online order immediately, then you should put a big banner on your website and outside so that people know the online ordering system is pointless."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Hi Adrian! I'm sorry about your experience with our online ordering system – we heard your feedback and we're using a new order ahead system, RDY. It won't make your drink until you're nearby, so you won't be waiting for your drink, or get cold coffee. The link is https://linktr.ee/RDYapp Plus, if you try it out this month, you'll get a free drink in your account every week through November. Thanks again for the feedback!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Wow! Great espresso & Macchiato coffee here!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Delicious drinks, good vibes, great branding :)"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The best coffee I’ve ever had in my life. It was so good it didn’t have to be a fancy drink, just a soy latte w simple syrup. I am sad that I am not a local."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Unfortunately for this place the coffee is good but the people are awful. Seems they only hire pretentious children who like to cosplay as communists. Even the slightest effort towards customer service would be appreciated, but I won’t be returning."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The coffee is one of the best I had in a few years. loved it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I really enjoy the sweet tooth varieties, though I recently tried a ginger/turmeric/oat milk espresso drink that was absolutely delicious! And they always serve drinks at the proper temperature, instead of the scalding feel of most of the large chains. I appreciate what they're up to."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I really really like this cafe. I have been here 3 times during my vacation. One of my top three cafes in SF. In case you were wondering, my first place award goes to Sight Glass, 2nd to Blue Bottle and Ritual comes in third, although it's excellent and would be a #1 in anyplace that didn't have insanely great coffee quality and great cafes everywhere. Check it out!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee worth every penny! Cute accessories and coffee-making supplies too. Vegan-friendly.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Well made coffee, cool spot, but it's not meant to stay for a while. No power or Internet (as is the trend in SF coffee shops) in addition to limited seating means this place is great to stop in for a coffee, but not too stay for a second.  For some reason I prefer this ritual to the one in Hayes or the mission. I think it's just the general atmosphere around the place or they managed to hire even better baristas... Either way, this place is easily one of my favorite coffee shops in the area"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Had a watered down chai latte and they don’t have wifi. Who doesn’t have wifi??  Very disappointing experience. It’s had a lot of windows for light which I liked but will definitely not be returning
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I want to love this place because they have great vegan options and carry Pepples vegan donuts! But I ordered a decaf oatmilk mocha and it was $7.25 for smaller than a Starbucks small 😨😨 so totally insane. And unfortunately it was somehow, according to my stomach, contaminated with dairy or almond milk. A real bummer. …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Easily the best coffee shop in SF, not only because of the coffee itself but the friendly staff and their passion for quality. So well done every time, always comes out on top amongst the rest. Come grab coffee, sit outside on the bench and people watch in the Haight"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee I've had in San Fransisco. They have seasonal espresso beans, which are fun. This ritual is usually not too crowded, but is bright and cheery. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I love this little corner. Had Colombia and Ethiopian coffee both which were amazing taste.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ordered latte and cappuccino, late was 95% milk, almost no coffee taste. Cappuccino was cold and also pretty bad. 👎👎👎👎👎 I think it highly depends on who is serving, the woman at the counter didnt even say thank you when I paid. …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Pour over coffee for the win! The shop is well lit with the lots of windows allowing you to watch the excitement of Haight street while enjoying great coffee. Space is a little tight, but I've managed to miss the lines so far."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Got the Los Gigantos coffee - loved how fragrant, strong and smooth this blend is! A few observations: we really enjoyed the view of three lovely, well maintained Victorian houses across the street as we drank our coffees in store; no sugar substitutes are available (this may be a good thing); if you don't see creamer or half and half, don't fret, just ask the baristas - they keep it chilled in a fridge that's out of sight."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The coffee here is very good best place to chill in Haight-Ashbury
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I love ritual coffees, probably one of the best Espresso in the Bay area. As a side note about the staff, I left my wallet in there and they had it waiting for me when I returned (and it was stuffed with cash.) Always have to appreciate honest employees"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Didn’t like the noisy background. Very sunny morning so the environment is really hot Tried the teen age riot single origin espresso americano. Flavour wasn’t strong. Claimed to have earl grey tea flavour but not strong.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Tasty coffee, ridiculous prices, and a clean but unwelcoming, sterile environment. Worth a visit, but for the high cost and medium taste (relative to local gems like Weaver’s), it is hard to justify and could never be a routine shop. Third wave coffee vibes."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Love it. Been waiting to come here forever. One of the best coffee and customer service in SF. Visiting SF you have to come here. This ritual coffee shop near the buena vista park. Best baristas ever , and customer service just the best."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Came here because of the good coffee, as experienced in other locations, but left disappointed because of the poor attitude. Barely a hello or welcome and definitely not a thank you or goodbye. I’m going to strongly consider other businesses before coming back here."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee but the barista did not know how to make a cortado. I got a latte and after complaining I got another latte a left. They could have done better
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Music was aggressively bad. It honestly felt like they were trying to get people to leave it was so loud and horrible. If I had to give it a genre I'd call it death funk.  Coffee was okay, it had an interesting taste but was too bitter. Barista gave us a weird look when we asked for milk."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Coffee is good but suuuuuuuuper slow service.....my gosh....why does it take sooooo freakin looooong. Honestly I would NEVER go there if there's more then 2 people in line...and why is it one size only. It's also pretty expensive, but I don't mind paying because it's pretty delicious coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Normally a good place but the idiot in glasses and red cap was so busy chatting/flirting with another customer that it took him 15 minutes to make 3 drinks.  If you can't work and talk at the same time, then just work"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I was excited to have Ritual in Haight Ashbury Dist opened less than one month, at the corner of Haight and Central, with bright, clean, modern decors! Cold brew: delicious, refreshing! Cappuccino: smooth & creamy, by far the best Cappuccino."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Good coffee on a sunny quiet corner of Haight Ashbury. Friendly service and good people watching spot
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Good espresso-style coffee, great location and friendly staff. Loyalty clip card system for ritual coffee stores are a bonus if you visit ritual often."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The more laid back/relaxed/less touristy Ritual coffee shop (vs the mission, which I still love). It’s a small and cozy space and provides a nice taste of the Haight Hippies without the offensive smells!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"A bright and cheerful Ritual location. I loved the pourover, but even as a coffee nerd who can talk about extraction parameters and roast development, I think the Starbucks Clover one I had the same day was just as good and half the price."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,tasty cold brew. cute and bright space.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Super stressed and paperwork obsessed staff!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great people, tasty pastries and awesome coffee.  You won't regret dropping by here to get your cold brew fix and a quick bite."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Decent cappuccino I got. Rounded flavor. Could be more distinct though.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I really do love the coffee but I’m so dissatisfied to see that after two years the bathroom is still closed. How do you sell beverages and not allow a public restroom?
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"One of my favorite cups in the city. Amazing espresso. Friendly staff, lovely shop and quality ingredients."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Great staff. Very knowledgeable and friendly. This is a great go-to neighborhood coffee spot and is a nice environment with a sun trap corner in a bright unit.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"You know, I usually avoid Ritual, because after 4 visits I've had one good cup of coffee, and this was the good one. So I'll for sure recommend this location, they were very friendly, service was quick and the coffee was good."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Love the coffee for a treat but it's not my daily spot because it's a little steep. One of the best Americanos I've had.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Expensive, pretentious, clean and minimalistic interior, not cozy, no WiFi! half a pound of coffee for $19  which turned out to be completely rancid. I returned it and got a replacement which also is rancid. Gross!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The coffee is good, but there are better places in the Haight with a more comfortable atmosphere. The prices for the food and pastries aren’t great value"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Nice coffee shop. Great calming vibe within. The coffee is good too 😊 …
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood. Seating can be limited since it's usually packed on weekends. Coffee is soooo good though and I love the friendly staff.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Didn't have a good experience with the barista, but the coffee isn't bad. Although, this being SF, you can find better coffee houses around."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"This place is one of the best place for coffee in the city. I rate it in my top 5 along with Four Barrell, Blue Bottle, Sightglass & Piccino. Highly recommended grabbing an espresso from Ritual."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I'm not sure why i was never keen on the coffee at the Valencia location, but i'm really digging on this new Haight spot.  I really like that they designed the space and merchandise to nicely integrate with the local neighborhood."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Fairly good coffee. Not the nicest staff. Also, someone shot their window this week. I'm not saying it's in a bad neighborhood, but it was weird."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Bright and airy coffeeshop to enjoy the cup of coffee while in Haight area.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Cozy place in Haight Hasbury to grab a coffee and sit in the sun or take a stroll in the nearby park. Cheapest item on the menu right now: holy basil tea ($3.50).
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Your typical high end coffee/bakery in a gentrified neighbourhood... Quiet setting, good seating, great location with great views.. friendly service.. I enjoy coming here very much"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,My passenger who I picked up at the airport left me outside of Ritual Coffee so she could socialize with her friends and then she said oh there's only one Barista working that's why it took so long and then she changed her destination two more times not to blame Ritual Coffee but this is the kind of clientele they have I'm just saying
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great Latte
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Nice fast service with very decent coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed and happy. A good place to enjoy your coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"A great addition to the neighborhood. Excellent coffee (pour-overs, espresso and cold brew), super friendly staff and a bright, workable space."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Cheerful baristas, clean ambiance, well executed pours. Cold brew isn't the best I've had or I'd give it 5 stars."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Only been here twice but their espresso is never as good as the Valencia location. Still pretty good though.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Cool spot to hang or catch up with friends. It has big sunny windows with lots of light and plants throughout. Good vibes ✌️
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"East-facing and on a corner, the sun warms you inside the cafe or while seated on their built-in benches on the sidewalk. Lovely and relaxing."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee! Ritual is one of my go-to places for coffee and beans, and my current favourite for decaf beans!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"A coffee shop with no wifi, they should have this on board lol. Came in to work a lil bit, but no wifi available. Coffee was average, not sure what's with the hype."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Decent coffee and pastries, I really like their seasonal drinks"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Fantastic lattes !! Love the spot in Hayes near the park

Ritual Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee in a small but very clean atmosphere.  Very friendly baristas!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"As far as taste goes, this is San Francisco's best. Unfortunately if you go here after the gym, ya might be denied service and asked to leave."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The staff is great and the coffee is excellent. The location is also pretty new, which is a plus :)"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,One of the Best coffee in San Francisco. I love their coffee and atmosphere here
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Good coffee.  Spacious for this kind of coffee shop.  Benches outside also make for nice sitting during the day.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The coffee itself is great but the atmosphere lacks any character whatsoever.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Always enjoy working and hanging out in this cafe. Good tea and decent coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"My boyfriend loves their coffee and the atmosphere is cute, though the tea is weak."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Nice light roast latte and mocha but barista wasn't very friendly and the music was loud and inappropriate for a cafe
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Kenya pour-over Ndundu is amazing. Burst of lemon and mango, but not too acidic or tart."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great place to drink a cup of coffee, talk a bit and get some reading done. Definite recommend."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Always fantastic coffee. The service is really nice too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Normally ritual is one of my go-to coffee spots but the service and quality in this location is awful. Do yourself a favor and go to the one in Castro!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Coffee was awesome me and my fiance had a wonderful time there
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"They don’t use Oatleys anymore, lattes aren’t as great as pre covid."
