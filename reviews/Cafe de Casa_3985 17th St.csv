Cafe de Casa,"Great cappuccino! Good enough space for people to sit! Nice and lively vibe! Staff was happy and nice! Also ordered Cocunut bread with cheese and guava jelly - which was really amazing! If you find yourself in Castro, definitely check this one out."
Cafe de Casa,"Their hot chocolate was one of the best I've had in the Bay area. Simply put, everything was delicious. Everything we ordered had a lot of cheese, so we struggled to finish the food we ordered, but it was all good. The carrot cake with chocolate was icing on the top."
Cafe de Casa,"Best new cafe ever in town. There are delicious coffee, bakery, breakfast sandwiches, lunch menu and salad! Finally someone does it right and fabulous 🤩! The service is attentive with the big sweet smile 😄. Love to come back for MORE 💋"
Cafe de Casa,"Great cafe and bakery! I got the churrasco sandwich special and I loved it! Crusty, fresh bread, well grilled hanger steak, and a great cheese spread. Plus, the fries were super crispy and salty. If I wasn’t full after lunch, I would’ve gotten a pastry as well. Would definitely go!"

Cafe de Casa,"I looooved loooved their coconut bread, I had to take an extra one to go. The carrot cake w chocolate was also very yummy, soft and the chocolate was perfect. We paired them w a latter with oat milk."
Cafe de Casa,"Beautiful, clean cafe offering made-to-order drinks from the coffee bar and foods from the kitchen.  The cafe walls is have some healthy plants and colorful packaged items that stand out against the white walls. The interior has bright lighting. There's outdoor seating, and different kinds of indoor seating. The windows offer views of the streetcars, while the couch area is more comfortable. There are also just some regular chairs and tables.  I ordered a cup of hot chocolate, which cost $4.25. I brought my number sign to the worst table in the cafe, next to the hallway leading to the kitchen and restroom. Still, it wasn't bad place to be. Not many people actually used the restroom, and the employees didn't go to the kitchen very frequently, because most people were having drinks. The drink had a thick layer of whipped cream, which insulated the hot chocolate. It took a long time to cool, so I recommend getting something else. People seemed to be enjoying the sandwiches and coffees.  Overall, I recommend trying this cafe out. The items are reasonably priced and it's a calming place to be. It's a nice oasis to rest for a while if your day has been busy. There's also free WiFi if you want to get some work done."

Cafe de Casa,"This is a clean, spacious place. The menu has a lot of options and everything is delicious. Honestly everything I tried made my mouth water, specially the bread. I can't wait to come back and try more things. I love the fact that the food is not only beautiful to the eye but also delicious!! In addition, the portions are very big for the salad and açaí bowl in case you want to share. Great place to come with friends or even on a date. Come here you won't regret it!"

Cafe de Casa,"Delicious chicken Coxinha and corn rissole.  We wanted a light snack and they hit the spot!  Be aware, the orange sauce is spicy! 🔥"
Cafe de Casa,"I came here bc it was the only cafe open past 6pm in the area and I’m pleasantly surprised at how cute it is. The decorations and aesthetic is pretty. Nice, cute place to study or chill at. I ordered a pastry and it was good. I would like to come back and try some of their Brazilian food like feijoada."
Cafe de Casa,"Cute little Brazilian coffee shop with lots of pastries and drinks to try, even beer and wine. The dining area is spacious and plenty of tables to use computers, read or just sit and talk. Drinks were strong and everyone was very friendly, would definitely come back again!"
Cafe de Casa,"Service is amazing, the place is very cozy and pretty . I love where it is located, you can sit inside or outside , many stores and restaurants around , unfortunately it is SF and parking is chaotic but it is worth it . I have tried the pão de queijo,açaí ,coxinha , orange juice, a cappuccino  and risole and it was amazing , just the empada that surprised me , the dough is different from what I know but overall everything was great. Definitely recommend and will be coming back !"
Cafe de Casa,"Nice tucked away cafe next to the most interesting intersection in San Francisco (Market & Castro). We had tea and carrot cake and while it's not your usual carrot cake, it was pleasing. The space is clean and bright and good to hangout for some time reading, working or simply having a bite."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,Came here after SoulCycle and really loved the food options here!  Good: - All the food here is amazing - honestly 10/10 the only reason I took off a star is for the slow service - Super cute aesthetics - very lit up on the inside and good vibes - Really great Rissole - got the beef and corn one and for the price it's super worth - Huge fan of the PB Acai bowl - surprisingly filling  Bad: - Had our order go missing for a while and someone finally got their food 30 minutes later  Overall really like the food here and will come back!
Cafe de Casa,Damn tasty. I got the Ceasar and it was quite large and appetizing.
Cafe de Casa,"Lovely place. Very well decorated, it looks clean and pleasant as you walk in. The food is tasty and the coffee mugs are big and with a generous size. The service is very good and friendly. I had a great experience."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,Delicious!! I had the original açaí bowl and my boyfriend had the ham and cheese sandwich! Both were amazing and we couldn’t get over how fluffy the bread was for his sandwich. We also got fresh orange juice and these was amazing!
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,The pastries are delicious. Salads are amazing the best Açaí bowl I’ve ever had.
Cafe de Casa,"Definitely worth a visit! The coffee is delicious and smooth. The breakfast sandwiches are so tasty and packed with flavors. I had the chicken, bacon, and Brazilian cream cheese sandwich and would recommend it. The space is airy and welcoming with very helpful staff."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business.
Cafe de Casa,"The food here is good. Not always consistent but good. But for some reason the service... I called to ask about what's in one of their dishes since I'm allergic to dairy I wanted to confirm before ordering, the person on the phone put me on hold, had someone else answering and then mid sentence they hung up on me and blocked my number? It's literally the first and only time I've ever called! But okay;) you can get a bit more sensitive to people with conditions you don't even know about. Thanks for your help!"
Cafe de Casa,Great coffee! The flavor is mild which I like a lot. Would also recommend the coconut bread with cheese.
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business.
Cafe de Casa,Never had Brazilian breakfast before so I checked this place out. I really enjoyed it. The acai was very good. And the pastry had excellent breading/moist. Good staff and interior was interesting. Would definitely come back for another breakfast.
Cafe de Casa,Super cute coffee and food spot I happened to discover while walking around the city of San Francisco. The green juice and their freshly brewed coffee were amazing. Highly recommend and worth a stop by.  Super friendly staff! I was running out of phone battery charge and they hooked me up with a charger. I really appreciated that!
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving your feedback. We hope to see you soon.
Cafe de Casa,Great food selection but I ordered the cheese bun with avocado tomato and mozzarella and it was just off. Cold and tasteless. Could go back to try something else though.
Cafe de Casa,"One of my favorite restaurants in the Castro. I don’t hesitate to schedule lunch or dinner meetings there.  I like the lunch plates, beef steak is my favorite. It comes with the side of fries, salad, beans and rice!  Also, they have great gluten free BR cheese bread that i order every time for the table to share.  Everyone I went there, they were very pleased with the service and food. By all means, give this place a try and you will love it!"

Cafe de Casa,Great place. Good coffee and great pastries. Seating situation could be better as it feels a bit cramped in the front. Fun place to work during the weekday (no laptops on weekend).
Cafe de Casa,"Really delicious brunch spot! Had a cheese bread sandwich with egg and avocado ($7.75) and a drip coffee, as well as a carrot cake covered in fudge. Everything was delicious - I even bought their coffee beans ($18) and hot sauce ($12). The cake was delicious, but tasted more like yellow cake than carrot FYI. Will come again!"

Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving your review for our business.
Cafe de Casa,Café de casa is favorite spot in the city to grab some Brazilian food/snacks. Yesterday I arrived 6:20pm and the lady was very rude when I was making my order. She kept saying the store was about to close so I only could get food for take out. I said ok no problem but she looked so irritated the entire time. Looked like she didn’t wanna any more consumers even tho the store closes at 7pm. I hope I won’t see her next time.
Cafe de Casa,"We had the quibe (kibe), pao de queijo, coxinha, and empada de frango (small chicken pot pie) to start. We then had the Fricassê de Frango (Brazilian chicken casserole) and feijoada. All were outstanding. I suggest ordering less if you don't have as much of an appetite / weren't hiking for miles beforehand. The cold brew was fruity. Service was excellent. And the space is pretty cute. Would definitely recommend!"

Cafe de Casa,"I live in San Mateo and decided to try this restaurant for the first time. I ordered almost $60 of food and they forgot my risoles, which I only noticed when I got home (40 min away). The food was good but I was really excited to try the risoles and I can’t go back to get a refund. Always double check your order before you leave the restaurant, I regret I didn’t."

The staff there are always friendly and willing to give suggestions. Great location. Great vibes. And of course, great coffee."

Cafe de Casa,Nice staff however this location does not do the crepes which is the whole reason we ventured here. Wish that was made more obvious somehow so we could have visited the other location.
Cafe de Casa,"It’s just so, SO good. Everything I’ve had here has been amazing. Also just a beautiful little shop. Highly recommend it"
Cafe de Casa,"Delicious Brazilian bakery items, cheese bread sandwiches, other lunch items, and fruit juice smoothies. Not recommending the coffee here."
Cafe de Casa,"I'm Brazilian, and this place is very genuine! Their food is fantastic, and the taste reminds me of home! If you want to try Brazilian meals and snacks, I highly recommend you to go! For lunch, I would recommend feijoada and for snacks, pão de queijo, coxinha, quibe, rosca de coco, and açaí! If you're looking for something sweet, try the brigadeiro!"

Cafe de Casa,"Lovely people, great juices, I will dream of their coconut bun. I would pass on the empada options and just double up on coconut buns."

Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We value your business.
Cafe de Casa,"I tried their coconut bread and really liked it so decided to try their other popular item - coxinha. It was SO good! I expected the exterior texture would be hard from the picture but it was actually soft, really well flavored and came still warm (had it delivered via Doordash). Instant favorite!"
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,"Delicious Brazilian food. Cheese bread sandwiches are gluten-free  - crusty outside, soft as a cloud inside. They have other gluten-free items and good dark roast espresso. Very friendly staff and a good vibe. Obrigado!"
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,I would call this a fantastic somewhat hidden gem in the castro. Its super clean and theres a lot of space to hang out. I got a gf cheese bread sandwich and a latte. Very good!
Cafe de Casa,"My go-to spot in the Castro for an espresso, some light work, and a snack (the cheese bread with cream cheese is delicious). Also, the staff is very friendly!"
Cafe de Casa,"Very sadly, we placed an order and nothing we ordered arrived correctly, we contacted the restaurant to try to solve the problem but the only thing we had was a totally bad and rude service and they just hung up on us in the middle of the call. And we only called because it was totally frustrating that they change the orders for things we don't eat like meat (vegetarian) and peanuts (allergy) and they didn't contact us about it."
Cafe de Casa,Great Cafe! Great atmosphere and ambiance... and delicious coffee! The bathroom was even beautiful. Check out the faucet

Cafe de Casa,"As a fellow Brazilian myself I found that the food was not only tasty, but very authentic as well. We ordered the pão na chapa and the ham and cheese pão de queijo, but the best thing was the açaí, taking me back to the ones I used to have back in Brazil. The staff is very courteous and polite."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving your review for our business.
Cafe de Casa,Great Brazilian food.
Cafe de Casa,Had the most amazing coconut bread and coffee here today. Delicious!
Cafe de Casa,Everything PERFECT as always. My favorite place got Brazilian gastronomy
Cafe de Casa,"After several visits this place has become a consistent favorite. The coffee is fantastic, and though I'm just making my way through the menu I've yet to be disappointed. It's great having some great Brazilian bites in the neighborhood - from coxhina to pastels and açai bowls."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving your review for our business.
Cafe de Casa,Cute setting in the heart of Castro. Grab a little pick me up snack and coffee with Brazilian specialities.

Cafe de Casa,"The place is cozy and well located, but the food wasn’t fresh and also they are not paying attention to the client. We went to have breakfast and we asked for two coffees and they delivered one , when I asked for the second they showed the bill where they charged only one and we were two people. Next time in San Francisco I would love to try another location for Brazilian breakfast."
Cafe de Casa,Great brazillian treats in the Castro.  I used to go to the South City location every once in a while and love how they prepare meat and their dishes.  We had the cheese bread and cake. While I tried to speak Portugese horibbly.  Thank you and happy this place is in the Castro.
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for the review. We hope to see you soon.
Cafe de Casa,I love this Brazilian cafe in the Castro. They have a good selection of sweet and savory food and everything that we had was delicious. We had the sandwich Americano with ham and cheese and the beef acebollado. The beef came with rice and beans. And for dessert we had a warm carrot cake drizzled with chocolate. All the workers are friendly and eager to assist with your food choice.
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving your review for our business.
Cafe de Casa,"Really good sandwich with picanha and amazing fries. The pictures do not do justice to the sandwiches. The mix of mozzarella, meet and cream sauce is not too heavy and makes the ensemble truly tasty. I’ll be back to try more items on that menu"

Cafe de Casa,"Beautiful setting to chat and enjoy gorgeous food. Very minimalist and zen with clean white spaces. The acai bowl was bliss with a good balance of flavours, they also served very good cappuccino, which is nice as most places only serve regular coffee in the area"
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for the review. We hope to see you soon.
Cafe de Casa,Who'd have thought of making a sandwich with pão de queijo? The bread pairs well with the bacon and catupiry cheese.
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,"I have been to 100s of cafes around the world. This place has a nice layout and it’s inviting inside. That is the only reason they get 2 stars. It would be 0 stars if I could do that. Staff has attitude especially the barista. I never understood why a lot of baristas have attitude? They make drinks, big deal! They are not saving the world. I ordered a hot chocolate that tasted like something you get out of a McDonald’s machine. This place uses two types of hot chocolate mix. Nestle powder in a bag and Ghirardelli two of the worse hot chocolate mixes around. Dude behind the counter needs to check his attitude. This hot chocolate I paid almost $5 for taste like chocolate flavoured water and leaves a nasty aftertaste. I won’t be back to this so called “cafe”."
Cafe de Casa,Super cute cafe in the Castro! Loved the cappuccino as well as the delicious Nutella coffee “l’avelã”

Cafe de Casa,"Now this is one truly deceptive place.  You'd be forgiven for walking past and not noticing this shop.  You'd be forgiven for thinking this is a non entity, does nothing, serves no one shop.  And there would be your fatal mistake.  This. Food. Is. REALLY. Good.  Flavorsome, tasty and enough food to drown you.  Do yourself a favor, just make sure you've starved yourself first.  Your stomach will thank you."

Cafe de Casa,"Juice was fresh, food was tasty and the menu had a decent amount of options which is always great. The area was nice and clean, overall you won't go wrong eating here!"
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for the review. We hope to see you soon.
Cafe de Casa,"The best latte in the Castro.I know you wouldn't necessarily look at a Brazilian cafe and think ""espresso"" but their coffee is very high quality and they know just how to treat the milk- even delicate milks like almond and oat. Lots of yummy Brazilian dishes, including sandwiches made on pao de queijo, this cheese bread that is naturally gluten free. Indoor and outdoor seating, and It's kind of tucked just around the corner from Castro street."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We value your business.
Cafe de Casa,We drove 30 minutes to try their açaí bowl and were turned away because they were “closed”. It was 6:30pm and their business hours stated they close at 7pm. I was so disappointed. What made it even worse was that there were a handful of people still eating in the restaurant so there was no reason we couldn’t be served. They simply said they were closed and offered no explanation or apology. This business is unreliable and a total let down.
Cafe de Casa,"San Francisco has its great Brazilian rodizio-type churrascarias, all-you-can-eat steakhouses like Espetus and Fogo de Chão. But what never seems to last in this city are more typical Brazilian restaurants. We fondly remember places that lasted a while, like Canto do Brasil and Minas, and others that were evanescent, like the late, lamented Brazilian Restaurant Brewing on 17th Street west of Mission.  Café de Casa is a different type of Brazilian eatery. If you have ever visited Rio de Janeiro, you will recall the lanchonetes, essentially snack bars, that seem to exist on every corner of Zona Sul beach communities, like Copacabana and Ipanema. These places are good for a quick stop to enjoy a vitamina (milkshake), acaí na tigela, a sandwich, or some other typical Brazilian snack like coxinha (a deep-fried croquette), kibe (a Lebanese-Brazilian specialty), and pão de queijo (cheese bread). Lanchonetes, though, are not the restaurants you go to for a full lunch or dinner.  Café de Casa has limited hours, from 8 AM to 7 PM, except on Sundays when it closes at 5 PM. During our visit here, they had only one printed menu for the entire restaurant, along with a large menu wallboard. You must order your food at the counter and pay immediately and one of the cooks in the back part of the restaurant brings the order to your table. Time from ordering to serving was reasonably quick. Although Café de Casa has a plethora of waitstaff, this restaurant is set up so that there is minimal interaction with the waiters. My friends and I speak Portuguese and we could not tell you whether the waitstaff is from Brazil, the U.S., or somewhere else.  While Café de Casa does offer a few entrees, for example, I had Escondidinho de Camarão, shrimp served in a ramekin and baked in a rich cheese sauce, which seemed authentic, along with a small salad and rice, your expectations should be more along the lines of a lanchonete, rather than a sit-down restaurant. That said, Café de Casa does offer limited indoor and outdoor seating, although much of their business seems geared toward takeout and delivery, a skill finely honed by many eateries during the pandemic.  My two supper companions selected items like you would in one of those corner snack bars in Copacabana and were generally satisfied. However, the pão de queijo one of my friends ordered was disappointing. While they do not serve caipirinhas, the Brazilian national cocktail, or even imported Brazilian beers, like Bohemia, they do offer tropical juices, canned guaraná, and espresso beverages. I ordered a café mocha, and it was good."
Cafe de Casa,"Nice outdoor area. Food was tasty, but could have been more flavorful. Nice variety of menu items. I'd go back!  Acai bowl was beautiful and not very sweet, if that's what you're looking for."

Cafe de Casa,This place is adorable and has great food. Nice staff and love the atmosphere.
Cafe de Casa,"Huge, immediate fan - this cozy Brazilian eatery sits well with my nostalgia for self-paced South American meals. A bulky churrasco plate supplemented by fried egg and açai smoothie was followed with a divine Sonho and topped with a smooth cup of coffee. A must-go for sugar addicts and OMAD advocates."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business.
Cafe de Casa,"Atmosphere: Super cozy spot in Castro for coffee and Brazilian food.  Food: I got the cheese bread, which was a bit dense for me.  WiFi: The WiFi is decent but not fast enough for HD videos, especially with a lot of people in store  Value: Overall great value for the atmosphere and food"
Cafe de Casa,Delicious Brazilian food at great prices!
Cafe de Casa,"The best Brazilian coffee in SF!!! Casa, in Portuguese, means “home”, and you def feel like home in the right moment you pass through the door. The food is amazing, the staff is lovely and gently, and the space is always a good option to enjoy your time with friends, family, or even work on weekdays. The coffee and the “coxinhas” are the best choices so far, but you should try the entire menu! :)))"

Cafe de Casa,"Loved their North Beach location when I lived there. And I've been patiently waiting for this location in the Castro to open, and it did not disappoint. The coffee, acai bowl, and pao de queijo were all fantastic and just as good as I remember. This location is also much bigger and they designed it so well; it's gorgeous inside.  I'll be a regular for sure!"
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving your feedback.
Cafe de Casa,"Not only the best Brazilian food in the Bay Area, but one my favorites, period. Everything tastes like it does back home. Hands down the best açaí bowl around. The coxinha and the picanha are also amazing. The staff is super nice."

Cafe de Casa,"Came here on a Saturday morning after watching the soccer game at Maggie McGarrys. The place is in a little corner and not very easy to spot compared to the neighboring breakfast place 8AM.  I have no idea about Brazilian food and randomly decided to order a Coxinha and a Brazilian coffee. The service was really quick. The Coxinha(pastry filled with chicken and cheese) was amazing and really filling. The coffee was good too albeit a little on the bitter side.  Overall, this place is awesome and is on par with other high quality breakfast spots in SF."

Cafe de Casa,We were very happy to have found Café de Casa. The espresso is prepared with a really good bean. The pastries really tasty. Maybe it was the Brazilian atmosphere that we (besides the dozens of Starb...) liked so much.
Cafe de Casa,"Very original and rich! We waited a bit for a table. I ordered the Milanese sandwich and it's delicious, the chicken with onion too!  The only drawback is that if you want to order something else you have to wait in line again, so I wanted to try more things. The waiters only bring the food, they do not give you more services and the tip is given from the moment you pay."
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business. We hope to see you again.
Cafe de Casa,"Great authentic Brazilian snacks! We ordered a coxinha, chicken pie and cheese bread with dried meat. All delicious, the coxinha, the best we've tasted in the US. Go early, as by the end of the day some items may already be gone."
Cafe de Casa,"Good place! Good service, coxinha could be better (less soft). If you need to use the bathroom, it's a problem because there's only 1 available for everyone, including non-customers (which is strange)."
Cafe de Casa,Typical Brazilian food. There are several in SF. The Acai bowl is recommended for a healthy breakfast. Good service.
Cafe de Casa,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. We value your business.
Cafe de Casa,Don't try to go 4:50pm. They close the shop ahead of schedule. They should change the store hours on Google maps. Don't try to go to the store at 4:50pm because they closed earlier then they said here. They should change the hours of operation of the store.

Cafe de Casa,"The excellent service was not enough to erase the disappointment with the feijoada. It was clearly served without proper care. Extremely watery. It is clear that water was added after preparation. Most of the meats were too dry. This mistake would be forgivable, but the addition of water is unforgivable."
Cafe de Casa,Girl at the cashier super nice... one of the guys who prepare the order is very rude treats you badly and then apologizes... I hate that you have to be nice all the time and not have to apologize...good food!!!
Cafe de Casa,"I had lunch with my family today at Castro's store, as I had ordered snacks. I had a chicken parmigiana that was the best of my life, with a divine sauce and a hearty meal that I brought home the rest. My husband enjoyed his fish too. Everything is delicious and the staff are very attentive."
