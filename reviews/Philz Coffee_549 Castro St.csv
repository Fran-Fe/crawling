Philz Coffee,"Their tagline is “we do coffee differently”, and I’d say maybe if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I’m a daily coffee drinker, but my taste is pretty simple: drip coffee, an americano or a latte is my go-to order. Philz apparently doesn’t think these options are good ones to offer at a coffee shop. I ordered a named coffee the barista recommended. I didn’t love it. Tasted like those coffee machine from gas stations that fill the cup with powder, then a dark liquid. Drank only half of mine. My travel partner loved their mocha, for what it’s worth."
Philz Coffee,"Staff is super friendly. Had a cup of  light-roasted coffee with a banana cake. The cake, I was hesitate to take it at first , but it tasted like homemade, yummmmmmmy. Coffee was full of aroma, for sure 😃. Good vibe to stay, quite and comfortable."
Philz Coffee,3.6 Some people love mint monitors but I don't. It reminded me of the first time I had a coconut drink. I should try something else.
Philz Coffee,"Good location and drinks are decent, although there was an excessive amount of sugar at the bottom of my iced mint mojito latte. And they main reason I'm writing this review: they did not let me use the bathroom! Bathrooms used to be for paying customers, now they are for employees only. I know this reflects a deeper problem with customer service in San Francisco, but when you're a coffee shop where people come to work, you have to let people use the bathroom. They say their customers are part of ""Philz Family,""  but that's no way to treat your family."
Philz Coffee,Mojito Latte.. mind blown but in a wonderful way. Taken by complete surprise and so glad I tried it.
Philz Coffee,"interesting concept with only drip coffees ! mint mojito is what they’re known for and it was definitely fun to try but wouldn’t get it again. ginger snap is less popular than mint but i thought this signature drink was better. iced drinks are difficult here because they’re using hot drip coffee to make them, so the iced mint mojito was a little diluted"
Philz Coffee,"There is a really loud, overbearing, constantly-talking employee (tall blonde long hair) that disrupts the mood of the cafe. People come to the cafe to work on projects, relax, to have a soothing time and to try to escape… they do not come in to hear constant, loud, obnoxious, personal conversations. It’s understandable to have chatter between employees but when you’re volume is at 150% it is extremely rude, tacky and unprofessional. Please speak to employees about this and if you’re a customer and need to focus on work do not come to this cafe."
Philz Coffee,"The music is great, good spot to get some work done and get your caffeine buzz. I had a rich hot cocoa yum!"
Philz Coffee,Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Every penny! I love their hot chocolate. I could bathe in it.
Philz Coffee,Been to many Philz and live next to the one in Belmont Shore/Long Beach. This was my first time at this location in the Castro. The service was mediocre and the bathroom was filthy. It honestly looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a while and was giving gas station restroom vibes. I’d definitely take a pass on this location next time I’m in town.
Philz Coffee,I had to use the bathroom while shopping in castro and thought I might as well get some coffee. I can't have sugar so I didn't have high hopes for my cold brew when I found out they didn't have any sugar free syrups.  I ended up ordering a small cold brew with just cream and two Splenda.  The first drink I took shocked me! Did they put magic in this cup? I can honestly say that this was the BEST cup of coffee I have ever had in my life which is saying something as I am an avid coffee drinker! I will be ordering some of their coffee for home as soon as I get back from vacation and will rave about Philz until I die.  If you ever get the chance to drink their coffee do it! And order a large!
Philz Coffee,Fun location and great staff. Enough seating to get some work done and enjoy a great conversation.
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, great service! The order taker was a total flirt but it was greatly appreciated!!"
Philz Coffee,"I love this place. Plenty of coffee choices to suit just about any taste.  Staff are always fun and quirky, just as SF is!  Popped in here yesterday only to find they were closed due to Covid.  Thanks for doing the right thing and protecting your staff."
Philz Coffee,If you like overpaying for low quality coffee that requires a ton of cream and sugar to be drinkable then this is the place for you. The staff are nice but otherwise I’m not really sure why this chain is so popular when there are many other local spots with much better coffee at the same price point.
Philz Coffee,"A nice place with very friendly staff but for European taste the coffee tastes horrible. I think the Americans like that taste, for us from Europe is more like dishwater :) but otherwise a great place and great attitude. Europeans: get tea instead of coffee or their amazing pastry"
Philz Coffee,"As usual, Philz always keep their most standard to serve their customers."
Philz Coffee,Specialty in Drip Coffee... Deliciously handcrafted from Bean to Cup. My Batista even airated my Tesoro. Novel concept with exceptional quality and service. Warm welcoming environment.
Philz Coffee,I love Philz in general but specifically THIS Philz! The cashiers are always so friendly and the rainbow design hints plus ode to Harvey Milk make me feel happy. We need more places that offer kindness and a smile! Thanks Philz!
Philz Coffee,"Philz Castro Street is consistently a 5 star experience. The counter staff are always friendly, funny, patient and accommodating. Though I'm only a 'regular' on my trips home to SF, I feel like one every time I step through the door. Whoever does the hiring for this location has got it spot on. Great coffee (obviously) and pastry selection. Plenty of seats and tables to stay and work if necessary. Good, reliable wifi. What more do you need?!"
Philz Coffee,"Small indoor and outdoor seating, but it wasn't crowded when I was there so I was able to find a seat. Good music selection and of course, amazing pour overs. Definitely will stop by again when I'm in town."
Philz Coffee,"We were there on 8/21/22 at 6:30pm, 30 minutes before closing. Manager was extremely rude. I won't come this branch anymore. She was yelling us and yelling her team too. 4 more person came in to the store after us. She regret to serve last 2 of them. Time was at 6:40pm when she did that."
Philz Coffee,"Great pastries I had this morning. I almost forgot about this review but here it is!  The coffee wasn't bad but WAY too strong for me. The food that came along with the coffee needed to be dipped in it for a better combo but alas I scarfed it down without thinking and my tongue for the past 2 hours is scorched!  The coffee is at least fresh and not watered down so there's that!  Decent food well fried on the outside, but It’s a solid place for less than 10 bucks! baked goods were good, too, but there was a small puddle of oil in the paper plate. I’ll be back!"
Philz Coffee,Just such a lovely SPACE! The people that work There are full of wanting to help and make your experience the best it could be! Helpful if you can’t figure out what you want and full of patience ! Coffee is just so yummy ! I didn’t know this shop was so close to my home— I suggest y’all try the amazing delicious coffee and experience the warmth and good vibes!! Felt like I was back in how SANFRANCISCO USE TO BE. “🎼”When you go to  SAN FRANCISCO be sure to wear some flowers 🌼in your hair”  🌺! thIS is the BEST COFFEE!! PLEASE GIVE YOURSELF A TREAT AND COME TRY IT OUT!    PEACE🙋‍♀️🇺🇦✌🏼
Philz Coffee,"Love Philz, of course, so much. The manager, Chris, is awesome. Go for the coffee and the kindness."
Philz Coffee,"The people here are always so kind and generous. Coming in here always feels familiar and safe. And of course, the coffee is amazing."
Philz Coffee,One of the highlights of my weekend in San Francisco was finding Philz. Extraordinary coffee in a chill environment... that's a sure way to make me happy
Philz Coffee,"Appeal from a coffee noob - don’t make people feel unwelcome. When someone walks in at 6:40 and asks for an “Americano” and a “Latte” don’t give them a scornful look and declare in a disdainful voice “We don’t do such things”, without offering alternatives or explanation. Chances are that here’s someone who just wants a black coffee of any kind to wake up, and might be keen on bringing a coffee with milk/cream to a loved one. This coffee noob will then struggle to find any of the right words. Thank you for then clarifying that “the company does not believe in latte”; I’m sure the pour over w cream you make is superior to anything out there, but I came in this morning looking for the same great service experience I appreciated when I came in 6 days ago, and this was a real let down."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee choices , especially liked the philharmonic coffee. Super friendly staff and great WiFi too (not unimportant 😊). Fabulous place to hang out and get some work done."
Philz Coffee,"My favorite place to sit, sip extraordinary coffee and watch the queer world turn on it's Castro axis."
Philz Coffee,This place it’s the best of the best.  The sweetest hearth customer service.   The nicer people. So cozy.   Very nice coffe and mocha.   I just love it. I cannot put other millions start for it .
Philz Coffee,"I love the coffee although it doesn't seem as strong as it used to be. Although I was the only customer when I walked in, it took almost half an hour to get my cup of coffee. I guess they were a lot of online orders to compete with. The staff is very friendly, but I wish I had known it would take that long."
Philz Coffee,"The website said this peets coffee opens at 5:30 AM. I was there at 5:30 and they were setting up, but it still wasn't open at 5:50 so I left. Maybe the business hours are wrong?"
Philz Coffee,"We had a great experience here not too long ago. We loved the coffee... the service and the choice of quick bites was GREAT! The Baristas are all very funny and friendly, but none better than Nicole (I think was her name) we have had the pleasure meeting her on our last visit, she was personable and so friendly. We will come back again and again! Thanks Philz."
Philz Coffee,Best coffee til now. I tried mocha tesora which is amazing
Philz Coffee,"Best staff EVER! I love these people! I love their coffee, I love their tea, I love all of it, and always want more. They play fun music (sometimes even broadway), it's a great place to get work done. Careful though! Their coffee packs a punch it keeps me up all night if I drink it past 2 pm."
Philz Coffee,"This is a coffee place for coffee lovers. But for novices or people just looking for a quick cup, they don't have the attitude your get at many high end coffee places. They are patient and cheerful even when you aren't sure what you want. The menu board makes it easy to decide as well. Individual brewed cups make for a spectacular cup of coffee. We enjoyed the outdoor seating on this popular street for people watching."
Philz Coffee,"Great java, tea, and tasty morsels!  The staff are all wonderful as well.  All handcrafted drinks as you order your favorites.  Always a great way to start the day, or a mid afternoon pick-me-up.  Best coffee in the Castro.  Thank you to Philz!  😀😀😀 …"
Philz Coffee,"A coffee institution. If you enjoy pour over coffee, this is your place. Knowledgeable staff that can tel you the differences of the coffee beans. They don’t do any type of espresso drinks, so if you’re looking for a latte, head elsewhere. A personal favorite is the iced mocha here. Also, they have quite a few tea options."
Philz Coffee,"Great atmosphere, cool furnish and very friendly employees. The chairs were not comfortable. My coffee was lovely but the chai of my partner was really bad.."
Philz Coffee,I heard a lot about this place and I was excited to try it for the first time. The only drink I had was the mojito iced coffee and this review is solely reflected on that drink. I have to say I loved the refreshing mint with the nice blend of not-so-milky but smooth tasting iced coffee. I ordered with milk and sweetener and it came out perfect.
Philz Coffee,"I went here before work the other day and chilled for a bit. The workers are incredibly friendly and there were obviously a bunch of regulars who come in - they were greeted by name! This was my first time, but it made me wish I was a regular here too. What a great atmosphere! And, of course, great coffee, as Philz is known for."
Philz Coffee,"Ordered a hot coffee and they gave me an iced coffee. They print the order and put it on the cup, it clearly said hot. The fact that they made it wrong isn't the issue. When I mentioned it to the guy behind the counter he said ""oh it's too busy for us to make another one, I'll just refund you."" There were 3 whole people in line. Absolutely terrible customer service."
Philz Coffee,"Really great coffee, especially if you like something a little different. Their flavor combinations are some of the most unique and tasty, but the best thing is they never are too sweet as is often the case with flavored coffee drinks. I recommend the Ginger Snap and the Mint Mojito"
Philz Coffee,"First time at any Philz location. First time ever having a Philz way coffee. I had the Philtered Soul. I must say, it's one of the ""best"" coffees I've had. Others in my party had the Ooh so good. I think mine was better. Service staff was really helpful and courteous. We'll probably visit the place again tomorrow morning. Street parking can be a problem."
Philz Coffee,"Philz built the absolute best coffee shop in their new Castro location. Rich with community, the staff are dedicated to Phil's mission of incredible coffee, one cup at a time. There's limited seating (but definitely more than expected), a few fancy toast options, and cold pressed juice from the Bay Area's favorite vendors. Beautiful day? Snag a seat outside and people watch or just wait for a friend to stroll by. As always, I live for a cup of Turkish, expertly made. They don't disappoint."
Philz Coffee,"Really good coffee, atmosphere is cool and modern and if you sit around you feel like a local."
Philz Coffee,"If you have the time, it's worth the wait for a really delicious cup of coffee. The staff is friendly an informative about subtle nuances of flavor for each bean. The interior is oddly sterile, although I cannot put my finger on why this is the case."
Philz Coffee,I love Philz coffee. The baristas always try to make each cup the way you want it.  This was my first time at this Castro location. It's smaller but there is a lot of seating both inside and outside. Most people just stop by for their Philz fix anyway.  The unicorn theme was everywhere and makes me happy.
Philz Coffee,"Large Turkish, sweet and creamy it's my regular order.  Philz coffee make a get consistent cup. I like that you order with the barista and then go to the counter to pay.  The only issue with this particular Philz is that there no waiting are which other Philz has. So after you pay, you actually don't have a place to stand by the barista to wait for your coffee order. Still great service, but it's crowded here."
Philz Coffee,"High quality coffee drinks plus tasty snacks and very nice servers. Good selection of different types of coffee, including 3 different decaf beans. Bustling shop has seats but isn't really conducive to relaxing."
Philz Coffee,Great Starbucks alternative in the Castro neighborhood
Philz Coffee,"Philz Coffee is the BEST! It just can't be beat. They were doing single drip coffee before it was even a ""thing"". All their locations are great because they serve the most delicious coffee on the planet. 5 STARS!!"
Philz Coffee,"this is my favorite coffee place! i love their mint mojito and their gingersnap. they make each cup fresh at a time and you can drink it right away. IF you bring in your mug, you get charged for the price of a small. When starbucks only gives you 10 cents off. Every staff member is always extra friendly and will do what it takes to make coffee taste good."
Philz Coffee,"This was our first time at Phil's and, oh my gosh, where we impressed. Our barista was amazing genuinely nice person passionate beyond belief about the coffee and very well educated and entertaining too. The coffee was a well-educated person's delight."
Philz Coffee,The best coffee in the world! And I've been to over 25 countries!
Philz Coffee,Amazing coffee and extremely sweet baristas
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee shop in the Castro. It’s one of a few coffee shops in the Castro. But, this location tends to have spotty service. They now prefer you to order ahead via the app due to covid. This commonly means that 30 minutes before closing they shut down online ordering and refuse to take your order in the store even when not busy. I’ve also gone during normal business hours and have seen the doors closed with no sign as to why closed. There are also about 30 signs, postings, and city notices on the door. It makes for a negative experience when you walk by.  If you haven’t been to Philz it’s a unique experience. They only offer drip coffee and tea (and now cold brew). All their coffee are blends. Their signature coffee is made with heavy whipping cream and brown sugar. They also have other milks and sugars you can get with their coffee.  I always find the addition of mint to be odd. But you can ask for them to remove this."
Philz Coffee,"I usually prefer European style coffee over American style brewed coffee, but they have so many types here that I’m almost a convert! Good selection of snacks too. Try the iced mint mojito on a hot day 🌱 …"
Philz Coffee,"Come here for serious coffee.  I don't see it as a really good coffee shop to hang out in, although lots of awesome dogs come by.  But the coffee is amazing (I'm not a big fan of coffee in general, but I really dig their coffee).  The baristas are amazingly helpful and friendly.  I love living right next to Philz Coffee."
Philz Coffee,"The best coffee I've ever drunk, although I'm rather a tea person. Their tea (with honey and mint leaves) is delicious as well! The interior design is not very modern, but the taste of coffee totally rewards this."
Philz Coffee,"Staff is really nice and helpful. I don't know anything about good coffee and the barista guided me when I had to choose. I guess the coffe was good but I don't really appreciate small differences between brews. There's also plenty of space to sit and chill, and the playlist they had playing at the moment was just perfect."
Philz Coffee,Favorite spot in the Castro for coffee.
Philz Coffee,"Despite my initial skepticism over ""one cup at a time"" coffee, Philz has me hooked. The menu board offers a plethora of options, with tasting notes listed akin to wine. The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly. While the Castro location can get busy on weekends, orders are fulfilled quickly and you can pay while your cup is being made. Pros: mint sprigs, free almond milk substitution, day old pastries on sale, vegan bakery options, convenient location next door to laundromat."
Philz Coffee,"Best coffee EVER. People are so nice, I love the vibe and I trully don't know a better coffee than a philz coffee. Iced and hot."
Philz Coffee,"Dancing water black as night.  That was a recommendation made to me by my friend...and it was probably one of the best decisions I've listened to as of late. As far as chains go, Philz is right up there, if not on top. This location is pretty trendy compared to a few other Philz in the city. Definitely doesn't have the charm of a more cozy coffee house but it's still a great location to grab a quick coffee and explore the rest of Castro/Market/Mission Dolores - all within walking distance too!"
Philz Coffee,"Order the iced Mocha Tesorra, and add fresh mint 👌.  You'll wonder how you went without it for so long."
Philz Coffee,"This place is trying too hard to innovate coffee, fancying itself more a bar than a coffee shop. I ordered an iced coffee, which was served in a hot coffee cup with no lid (it spilled in less than 20 seconds). I've found that California doesn't do iced coffee well, but this place especially. Since the ice melted quickly, I could tell it was hot coffee poured over ice, rather than coffee brewed specially to be cold. I drink my coffee totally black, but the coffee was not good, so I wanted to add either milk or sugar, only to find that I'd have to return the coffee to the barista to get anything added. (No thanks!) Positive points for the LGBTQ-affirming environment."
Philz Coffee,"If you haven't been to Philz, it's time to go. I'm not sure what they do differently to their coffee, but the texture and complexity is nothing like I've ever tried before. And if you want a true caffeine buzz, you'll get it here with their medium or light roasts. Philz, please never go away."
Philz Coffee,The main coffee there is really good I realized they're meant coffee sweet creamy mint coffee ice is the delight of the day I always stop in to this place on real basis and get their coffee for desserts
Philz Coffee,"Hey yea it’s a Philz Coffee. I feel like they’re all about the same and if not, they’re doing it wrong. They’ve got some crazy coffee, some of which is really good, some of which is t that good. The pastries here aren’t really worth it in my opinion, but the coffee usually is."
Philz Coffee,"Does not live up to the hype. I always hear my friends raving about how great the mint mojito is, so of course when I was nearby I had to try it. This location is pretty small with only a couple seats inside and outside. I ordered the large ice mint mojito to take with me. The drink was made fairly quickly and looked aesthetically pleasing with the mint leaves on top.  After taking my first sip, I was underwhelmed with how not ""phenomenal"" it was. I just thought it tasted like coffee from Starbucks. After drinking about a third of it, I just decided to give it to a friend to finish."
Philz Coffee,Philz coffee is excellent but expensive. They make each cup individually. They also have great desserts though many times they are sold out. Each Philz seems to have a slightly different selection of food.
Philz Coffee,Large Iced Ecstatic Philz way on hot days. Large Julie's Ultimate Philz way the rest of the year. Watching newbies trying to order is a great pass time while you wait. They haven't idea how caffeinated they're about to be. Ha!
Philz Coffee,"Went in (albeit hungover) to get a morning pick me up. Because my tastebuds didn't know what to do, ordered the mint coffee. Was a BIG mistake. Had to get others to try it because i didn't know if my senses were off, but indeed it was rank, so just stick to plain old and you can't go wrong.  Also had the one thing you don't want to happen in any coffee shop. You go to where it says take your order, the staff member tells you to go down to the barista instead, who says ""no go back to the cashier first"" and you end up  in the middle of a stand off when you just wanted coffee."
Philz Coffee,"I love philz coffee ☕. It's one of my favorite palces in San Francisco. This one, at Castro, isn't the best, because always there's a lot of people. For example, I couldn't take a chair, not even outside. And I had to come back to my place, because the bathroom never was alone. There were 3 persons before me in the wait line."
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee is usually a hit for me because their mint mojito iced coffee usually satisfies my caffeine addiction, but sadly this location in the Castro didn't do it for me. The mint mojito and hot chocolate drinks were both watered down and quite flavorless. Aside from the drinks, the baristas were friendly and personally walked up to each guest 10 minutes before closing to alert them of the time. The store is filled with rainbows and clouds screaming happy unicorns and smiles. Would I drive out here to grab a cup of coffee again, probably not. My local Starbucks will suffice."
Philz Coffee,"Worst coffee ever. Both my husband are big coffee lovers and ordered one medium and one dark roast coffee with milk. Both coffees were so bad, bland, watery and tasteless that we ended up tossing them away without drinking them. And they were not cheap."
Philz Coffee,"Best coffee experience in SF. Hands down. The baristas are always pleasant and the coffee is delicious. Make sure you like cream and strong coffee.  My favorite is Turkish medium cream, medium sugar with no mint. I dare you to try it."
Philz Coffee,"If you have been to one Philz, you have been to all, at this location it is tastefully decorated with local color and artfully designed. Note that they do not do espresso-based coffee drinks, however I only drink tea."
Philz Coffee,"I am European and generally not a big appreciator of coffee in America, but there are interesting choices to try in Phill's. I chose the ice coffee mint mojito and it was actually quite nice."
Philz Coffee,Been to this caf on a Tuesday morning.  Ate avocado and egg sandwich on a sourdough toast and had a Turkish coffee Philz's way with extra mint. Nice sweet and sour combo.  Sandwich was fresh and balanced and coffee was quite an interesting flavor.  Great free WiFi.  The music got a bit loud after 10am.
Philz Coffee,Colorful cafe with some great artwork posted and some nice workspaces while you drink coffee or tea specially made by the baristas.
Philz Coffee,"It is a Philz. Literally, the best coffee on the planet. Why are you drinking coffee from ANYWHERE else? Do your caffeine-addicted brain a huge favor and get the biggest size you can handle. Okay, sure they use heavy cream so your waist line may not thank you,  but it is so worth it."
Philz Coffee,"Rich, full-flavored coffee, made-to-order, cup-by-cup. Friendly and knowledgeable staff who will help you choose a coffee to fit your taste buds. Great pastries and sandwiches, as well."
Philz Coffee,"My go to work spot, though sometime impossible to find a seat. My favorite menu items are the ice chai (sweet & creamy!) it has the perfect amount of sweet and spicy flavor, and the other item I love here is the Kouign-amann I seriously dream about this baby. The staff are always super friendly."
Philz Coffee,"Philz has opened my eyes to how delicious drip coffee can be! I am a huge fan of the tesora, philtered soul, iced gingersnap, and the swisswater. Their coffee is strong and packed with flavor. The menu is categorized nicely so you can pick the blend that's perfect for you. Best of all their baristas take quite a lot of care into each and every cup."
Philz Coffee,Philz is probably my favourite coffee shop in the whole world !! ☕
Philz Coffee,"This will be my inaugural post for Google+ Local, and what a better way to start than Philz! I remember being introduced to Philz in the first week I was in San Francisco, and boy, this did not disappoint.  Every Tuesday, I meet up with my coworker who lives in Castro to carpool down to Sunnyvale to see our client. I have to wake up super duper early just to get to Castro to get to her place, but I recently found out that there's a Philz near her place -- so it totally makes it worth it. You might pass by it first, because you see ""Spin and sit"" or something like that. It's slightly hidden, which makes it a tad bit more special.  What I love about this specific location is that every single barista here is SUPER duper nice and just makes your day a lot better. I'm not much of a morning person, but every single time I walk in here, the baristas are always slinging the sweet nectar of Earth.  I always get the Philtered Soul - some people swear by Ambrosia. It really depends on your palate. I hear the iced mojito is awesome as well (however, I've been sick the last two times I have gone here, so I haven't tried a chilly coffee yet).  Definite recommend."
Philz Coffee,"This place is not for me. You can't add your own amounts of cream & sugar, the baristas do it for you. But if you like coffee with way more sugar than you want, or if you like mint in your coffee, then you might enjoy this place. And the lines are interminable."
Philz Coffee,"When barista is thinking that he is a king of Monaco, not less, it's not very good for your coffee taste. Guys, just be friendly and your coffee will be much better:)"
Philz Coffee,"While i seriously miss the starter ginger scones, philz coffee never fails. Philtered Soul is my fave."
Philz Coffee,"I honestly don't like Philz coffee for a large variety of reasons. The first one is because I don't understand how you can call a coffee 500ml of caffeine. Second, why needing to wait for ever pulling a coffee like that? Also, why dont you guys serve lattes? I know this may be a question of taste but Philz is not good for me. Also this one is located in a weird area in the Castro... not for me, sorry..."
Philz Coffee,Two words - MINT MOJITO!  I've probably said the same thing to all of my friends who have ever visited a Philz or ever wanted to. The Mojito Iced Coffees are simply amazing and with no frou-frou fancy lattes in sight these mint mojitos make you wonder...  The Philtered Soul is also one of my favorites since I'm a huge fan of nutty coffees. Check out Philz Coffee sometime and if you're lucky enough to meet Phil... let me know!
Philz Coffee,Such friendly fun staff half the reason to go is to talk to them!! But the coffee is awesome too. Silken splendor ftw. Can't wait for them to expand to Austin.
Philz Coffee,"I don't really care for coffee, but when you walk into the busy coffee shop of Philz Coffee you are hit by all the fabulous rainbows. OMG so so cool. The coffee itself is wonderful and loved the experience. Just so cute omg."
Philz Coffee,"The Tesora was delicious, and all of the employees are so nice! Loved it and will definitely come back:)"
Philz Coffee,"Although this has moved from 18th over to Castro and become a bit more 'bizzy' etc.  I really enjoy the coffee, it is so darn good.  If you do not know what you want, they will ask you a few questions and help you find the right mix."
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee never disappoints. Aside from the manner in which you order your coffee, something unique about Philz is that your Joe is always served at the perfect ready-to-drink temperature."
Philz Coffee,"philz coffee is my favorite. it isn't for everyone. the large selection of blends gives good variety. reminds me of the east coast, because yiu tell your barista how much cream and sugar to put in. takes a little flexibility and experimenting, but gaeat things come faom persistence!"
Philz Coffee,"I LOVE PHILZ COFFEE!! The best coffee in town, hands down. They only serve drip coffee and have multiple locations but this is the one I go to most. The baristas are, most of them anyhow, very friendly and helpful in making your drink order. My favorites are: philtered soul, philharmonic (with cardamom), mocha tesora, and dancing water. Iced coffees are good too, especially the Mint Mojito and ginger snap!"
Philz Coffee,"The best coffee shop, not only because the coffee is delicious, but the staff is just awesome!"
Philz Coffee,My favorite coffee shop in SF . The menu is so rich and staff always helpful and friendly. The best way to start my day is with my mint mojito .
Philz Coffee,"A nice place to get some coffee and get some work done. The music can be really loud and it's often crowded enough that you can't often find seats for 2+ people, so be aware of that when trying to meet someone here."
Philz Coffee,"Crazy coffee makers, legendary in SFO, recommended by everyone. Really liked their different takes on coffee, feels more like an experimental cocktail bar or coffee laboratory. Friendly staff."
Philz Coffee,"Always great. Staff is super nice and some remember my order. Like any other Philz, it can get packed quickly but still really like this spot."
Philz Coffee,An always amazing cup of lovely. In this case a hybrid Silken Soul AND I picked up 16oz. of Philtered Soul whole beans! My life is complete.
Philz Coffee,"Really bad service, i order my coffee online , and after it was ready,  i went over to pick up my order, and it wasn't ready,  they told to wait at least 30 min , really 30 min for a coffee.  If you don't have the people to make the coffee don't take so many orders.  And besides they always messed up the other people's orders."
Philz Coffee,"This place makes me sad. Pretty location. The coffee and tea are ok. But only just. They could be so much better (as they were in the old location). Crowded. Staff is often good, but sometime look like they could care less."
Philz Coffee,Awesome!! Coffee. Small place but great atmosphere..the coolest part here is whoever takes your order get your coffee..it is almost doing it your self...great place for a good morning sip.
Philz Coffee,The guy in front of me ordered and apricot pastry. The barista said she had extra apricots from her tree and that she would give him some. Love Phikz coffee and love SF.
Philz Coffee,We were visiting the city and were just walking in the area when we stumbled upon Philz.  The staff were super helpful and friendly and the coffee was terrific.  A very nice change from the usual coffee shops.
Philz Coffee,"Always friendly and top notch coffee selections. Love the mint mojito, not an overly sweet coffee drink like so many others."
Philz Coffee,Poorly staff and the outlets don’t work/aren’t turned on.
Philz Coffee,Staff ok. Great location.  Too many Borgs sitting working while nursing an empty coffee cup While real customers look for seating.  Coffee ok. Prefer my coffee wth a conversation.
Philz Coffee,"I've been using Philz for months now, the people are riendly the coffee is great, and I don't feel rushed to spend my money and leave. Thanks guys you make Frisco look good."
Philz Coffee,"If you're looking to get bonkers off the caffeine and live dangerously---pick the Mint Mojito, obvi. Its potency is magically delicious.  When in doubt, their sweetened Chai has a rich creamy substance. Getting near the bottom of the cup is always a treat!  Both drinks have wonderful mint leaves to nibble on."
Philz Coffee,Love their hot chocolate
Philz Coffee,"Love Philz coffee, nice baristas and also like that they have an app to order ahead. Love that it is a neighborhood staple for me."
Philz Coffee,What can I say?   I just love the coffee here.  Try the Silken Soul... it is a 50/50 mix of Philtered Soul and Silken Splendor.  Try it with half and half extra creamy.  It is so goooooood!  I'm salivating just typing this.
Philz Coffee,"I drink decaf, and the coffee is too strong for me.   Very bitter tasting.  The also play loud annoying hip, hop music inside.  Not conducive to relaxing."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee good people! WiFi, good music and a substantial bagel menu make this place aces for the Castro. Only wish they had order ahead!"
Philz Coffee,"this was the only Philz I knew many years back I was long burned out on $-bucks and one day I revisited the castro and saw this place and gave it a try, they had adacric brewed coffee and they did not disappoint, philz became my favorite."
Philz Coffee,Great coffee. Absolutely lovely staff. Great for people-watching.
Philz Coffee,"This is my fave Philz location. The staff is super fun and very friendly, the atmosphere here is very cool. And of course, the coffee is amazing."
Philz Coffee,"If I had to choose between playing with puppies and coffee at Philz, I would choose Philz every time."
Philz Coffee,"Holy Xmas! My sister wasn’t kidding. The coffee here is outstanding! I wish we had a Philz in Ithaca, NY."
Philz Coffee,"I don't get why these guys are so popular. Coffee is fine but never really made me think, ""Wow... I can't believe I don't come here more often."" Guess I'm more of an espresso drinking person."
Philz Coffee,The new bistra the young man made a wonderful cup of Silken Splenda and the bacon Birido was wonderful and you have plugins for people's devices.I felt at home and Sheriff Roscoe did to we went grudges I felt like I was around good people your no one in my book Pilz Coffee you really know customer service thank you.

Thomas Peltier and Sheriff Roscoe
Philz Coffee,So much love for Philz. If you’re nice to the baristas they’ll let you in on some off the menu items !
Philz Coffee,Always enjoy going here. Everything is awesome
Philz Coffee,"Barista was rude and short with me, didn’t bother to call out my drink when it was done either. Completely unhelpful and difficult to interact with."
Philz Coffee,"No, no no no no no.  Please no more Philz.  I see these opening up in random places these days.  Because people just seem to not get enough.  I don't like this place.  And I've tried this location as well, hoping it'd be better than the first Philz I went to.  Nope.  Sorry Phil."
Philz Coffee,"I'm obsessed with the ecstatic iced coffee, creamy. I always love doing some work here too. Always filled with people working and enjoying life."
Philz Coffee,"What a unique, delightful, delicious coffee experience!  I was visiting for three nights and heard this place was great.  It was beyond my expectations!"
Philz Coffee,"Mint coffee is dangerous great. Terrific coffde, great service. A few outside seats to enjoy sushine in front."
Philz Coffee,"One of my all-time favorite coffee shops. They don't have espresso drinks, but if you're in the mood for pourovers, they're hard to beat."
Philz Coffee,Decent Coffee at best. 24th street in the mission has a terrible ambiance and there were tons of fruit flies in the food display case. Sick. 18th street in the Castro has better service and a better location.
Philz Coffee,San Francisco native!  Well except for Phil...his great coffee grew up here though and has spread all over the world!  Visit Mother Ship at 24th & Folsom...
Philz Coffee,Excellent Coffee with my own barista. Lots of options busting with flavour. I Recommend the place.
Philz Coffee,"Love the coffee, and the staff is nice and helpful. They are nice to my mom too, so that's good."
Philz Coffee,"Consistently the best coffee, friendly service, and hip vibe in the Castro hands down. Only downside is cost; It's completely worth it though."
Philz Coffee,Philz is my favorite. They have a nice selection of coffees. Definitely a good staple place to go for the bay area
Philz Coffee,"Always love Philz... Great service, reliable coffee, clean bathroom and seating area. One of the very best in SF."
Philz Coffee,"Great staff, locals and great tasting coffee. The wait for service can be up to 5 minutes during busy periods such as the morning rush."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee. Not a great place to work as it's always packed, but maybe nice to sit for a moment"
Philz Coffee,I'm just not into the coffee poor thing - must be  an antipodean thing but give me a flat white any day. Good choices here though if you are into that kind of coffee
Philz Coffee,A typical Philz coffee experience.
Philz Coffee,"I really like this Philz! The staff is always fun, nice, and attentive. Great coffee too!"
Philz Coffee,"This is a fairly new branch and has some funky decor based around ponies and unicorns. It has the range of usual Philz fare, plus one or two extras from the kitchen."
Philz Coffee,Great coffee with friendly staff! Make sure to get the avocado toast
Philz Coffee,Get the Tesora with cream and sugar
Philz Coffee,HORRIBLE SERVICE. 2 out of three times my drink is totally wrong. ...that is after waiting for 20 minutes to receive it. Garbage time wasters from hell
Philz Coffee,Instead of sweet black coffee and almond croissant I got unsweetened coffee with milk and chocolate croissant! And the waiting time was 20 mins!
Philz Coffee,Great pour over coffee crewed one cup at a time. Slower but well worth it. Good prices as well.
Philz Coffee,Barrister was amazing. His knowledge of coffee was great. Very friendly staff. They definably have a passion for coffee
Philz Coffee,"Its philz, one of the best coffee's in the city. There is not enough seating and usually its full. Has free wifi."
Philz Coffee,"The mint mojito is the best coffee flavor I've ever tasted the staff was friendly and gave good service, a must stop for anyone visiting"
Philz Coffee,"Tis quite the busy spot,but,it's definitely worth the wait...EVERY TIME! Haha mmmm now I'm cravin' a Mocha Tesora w/ a chocolate kouign-amann!"
Philz Coffee,"Very nice little coffee shop, I had the iced gingersnap it was very good."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, great staff, long lines, but I'd say their coffee is worth the wait."

Philz Coffee,Extremely friendly staff - and who doesn't love Philz?
Philz Coffee,"They did a good job with this location. Good communal work tables, bench seatings and a front patio area to enjoy people watching."
Philz Coffee,There should be something abot the way they make coffee that people really like and appreciate it. I am not a coffee drinker can't judge fairly.
Philz Coffee,"Good coffee , great coffee ...but typical San Fran hipster artisenal  crowd and atmosphere ..   the Simpsons would mock this place"

Philz Coffee,The best coffee I have ever had. They use a manual drip process and grind the beans before every cup.
Philz Coffee,"I like Phiz, but I don't love it. The coffee is good, but I dislike the blaring music at this particular Philz."
Philz Coffee,You select from an astonishingly large collection of different roasts and blends which are prepared fresh for each cup with the pour over method.
Philz Coffee,"This is a great location, the coffee is made perfectly to your desire. I recommend"
Philz Coffee,Not like other coffee houses.  Your batista is your friend.

Philz Coffee,"Philz was hopping on a Saturday at noon, and their flavored iced coffees were phenomenal!"

Philz Coffee,"Pricey but good..  unless you're lactose intolerate, cuz they use a heavy cream"
Philz Coffee,Great service. Great coffee. Free Wi-Fi. Nice location.
Philz Coffee,I walked in as a online delivery person not knowing that you have to wait in line to place the order so the cashier when I approached her was very rude in her attitude was very bad I would definitely not pick up an order from there again
Philz Coffee,"I like the coffee, the staff are always great but the line?  Not so much."
Philz Coffee,Really good filter coffee. No fancy cappuccino stuff. Friendly staff.

Philz Coffee,"When ever I visit the Castro, I find myself going to Philz every time.  Good stuff!!!"

Philz Coffee,great coffee
Philz Coffee,Great coffee
Philz Coffee,Good
Philz Coffee,Interesting place
Philz Coffee,"Very good coffees, good atmosphere and well placed. Reasonable prices and good advice"
Philz Coffee,"I ate mint mojito with cream and it was delicious. The part-time worker was Korean. It was nice to hear that he spoke Korean for the first time in two weeks since coming to San Fran, but he couldn't show it. I want to eat again"
Philz Coffee,"We took Philtered Soul for a sample without milk and sugar, especially to feel the taste. A sour coffee, which usually means brewed with the more expensive variety, Arabica. The taste is interesting, strong, rich. Worth it to try. They didn't say anything about the dog in the stroller. There were no empty seats to sit down, all visitors sit with laptops)) The coffee is delicious, but not the best that you have ever tried. I miss the atmosphere a bit for an establishment in such an interesting area. For some reason, I wanted some cute little things like multi-colored straws or napkins. And the guys here hang out friendly, our dog was treated to delicious treats and hung with compliments."
Philz Coffee,"Mint Mojito is a must try if you come to San Fran. It's not a latte, it's called coffee with cream, but it's sweet and delicious because of the cream."
Philz Coffee,"The most representative coffee shop in San Francisco, it is really delicious and much better than a Starbucks coffee. The best coffee I've ever tasted is here and it's called the mint mojito."
Philz Coffee,"Very good coffee to drink a drink made with care (coffee, chocolate or more complex drinks) Correct prices."
Philz Coffee,"They have many coffee beans, very well explained. They pass the coffee by drop and put the sugar before to better capture the flavor. Very interesting technique and the result is very good."
Philz Coffee,The mint mojito latte was so delicious. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and the mint flavor was subtle. It was nice that all the staff were friendly.
Philz Coffee,"I don't know why so many people recommend mint mojito. I like mint, but I wasn't impressed. Since you came to San Fran, I think it only means to try it."
Philz Coffee,"I drank Dark Coffee and Istanbul Coffee, both of which were jmt. The staff were very kind and I liked the freewheeling atmosphere. Hang out with Castro"
Philz Coffee,I was the only one in line and despite this I had to wait for a long time because the two people serving the bar were very focused on talking to a guy and forgot about the customers. POOR ATTENTION
Philz Coffee,Some Koreans come. Mint Ice Coffee is as good as expected. The toilet line is long and the store is not big~
Philz Coffee,"Very American coffee with hardly any flavor, too much water"
Philz Coffee,"Nice, small coffee shop with many cold and warm coffee variations, similar to Starbucks. Thank you. 🇺🇸 🇩🇪"
Philz Coffee,Coffee treat = Philz!
Philz Coffee,The worst Chai tea I've ever tasted. #thymus
