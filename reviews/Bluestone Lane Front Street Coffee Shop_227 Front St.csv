Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"I stopped here on the way to the office during a work trip and I was somewhat underwhelmed. The avocado toast was tiny and had nothing but chili flakes on it— a bit sad. The matcha had very little powder, so it mostly tasted of milk. The staff is kind and the coffeeshop is cute though, they have comfy pillows, plants, and nice decor."

Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"1st time visiting. Purchased a yogurt and croissant, which looked good. Welp! The yogurt was great...but that croissant was stale, and not fresh...as if it was from the day before. Next time ask how fresh is their baked goods before purchasing.  06/02. Changed my previous 1 star rating for I received a response to correct the matter by Bluestone. Thanks Bluestone, and I appreciate the gesture."

Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Had a pretty good Breakfast All Day bowl. Good cafe for coffee and small bites, not so much a real “brunch” place. Very Keto friendly. Cute ambiance — nice furniture and decor."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Cheers Julia!  Thank you for stopping into our financial district cafe and having a wonderful brekkie bowl! We hope to see you again soon!  -The BL Team
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Delicious healthy food that tastes amazing, with unique online order system that is delivered to your table. It is a concept of “contactless” which I really like."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Crisy! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Very busy in the morning but their self service kiosk is helpful. Nice environment but can get quite loud and difficult to talk. The coffee was good though.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Hello Gordon! Thank you for the feedback and we are glad to know that you liked our coffee. See you again soon!
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Absolutely love this place. Very quaint and cozy. I always get the mocha with oat milk. It is velvety and heavenly. I appreciate the fact it is not very sweet. Exactly what I remember a true mocha to be. Please do yourself a favor and get that little round cross bun looking pastry I don't know the name of it but that is addicting. The staff here are great. Very down to earth and not high stung. I visit the financial district location about three times a week it's that good.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Hey mate – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local!
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Delicious. Tasty. A perfect place to start your day with your family on the weekend or business breakfast fluting the week.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Olga! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"We were looking for breakfast and found this place. We had been to a Bluestone Lane in NYC and had enjoyed that visit. This was a much smaller cafe with some seating inside or outside. It is counter service only and the menu was much more limited than the other cafe we had been to. Coffee (cappuccino) was good but the avocado on toast and the smoked salmon on toast were disappointing, served in a cardboard box and pretty small for the cost. We would not try these smaller cafes again as they are more suited to those on their way to work."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Saturday morning breakfast. Walked in spontaneously. Salmon toast, black coffee and a brownie. Everything was really good. Staff is super friendly and even remembered my name when I came back for another cup of coffee. Awesome! Highly recommended."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hey,  Thank you for the review and for your support of Bluestone Lane We look forward to seeing you again soon for your daily coffee stops!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"This place is in the middle of action. Great location, tasty coffee with sprinkles of chocolate. Always clean with great wifi."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Cheers Esther! We hope to see you back again soon!  -The BL Team
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"If you're looking for a smooth, rich good old Australian type coffee, this is the place. The oatmeal is delicious and there's a nice range of juices too."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hey Clare,  Thanks for an awesome review! We hope that Bluestone Lane helps transport you to Australia, if only for a fleeting moment. We hope to see you again soon to enjoy another great coffee and cold pressed juice -- the Torquay and Portsea juices are personal favorites!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Gotta have an avo toast when you visit Bluestone. Love that lemon zing! Free wifi was good but it expires after an hour I think - that was disappointing - but I was able to use the other free wifi in the area which connected easily and signal strength was fine. Power outlet was also in convenient reach along the wall so I was able to get some work done before lunch.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Great place for breakfast! Their bowls and toasts are delicious. A bit pricy though, but it is San-Francisco financial district lol no complaints"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hi Natasha,  Thanks so much for your review and support of Bluestone Lane! We hope to see you in again soon!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"I wish the place stayed open until 4pm but that's just to fit my schedule. It's a busier cafe, there's a good handful of people every time I visit. The smoothies and tea is very good. I appreciate the healthier food options. There's a lot of tables so there's plenty of space to sit and work on stuff."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hey Angel – we love the smoothies and teas, too! Thanks for the review and for being a Bluestone local."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Great coffee and avocado toast.  Very nice staff and location.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Hi there Ian - thank you for the review! I'm glad to hear you had an amazing time with us.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Wonderful experience for here! I cancel my order since I had to leave for an urgent appointment. The team (Kaiser) quickly refunded me but still gave me the Tea (wellness golden latte) since it was already prepared. Thanks.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Good coffee :) Mediocre overpriced food :( Very loud music, not comfortable to chat or read."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Not the beat experience I’ve had at Bluestone Lane. Their New York locations were great, staff were friendly and inviting but can’t say the same for the San Fran (Front street) location.. coffee was very weak and staff were  zombie-like."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hello Rachel,  Thank you for stopping by our Front Street Coffee Shop and for taking the time to reach out to us with feedback. We are sorry to hear that your experience at out Front Street Coffee Shop was not up to standard. We would love to chat with you to find a way to make it up for this experience and implement your feedback.  If you would like to email at feedback@bluestonelane.com we look forward to hearing from you!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"I came here on my way to catch a flight once, and I was wearing an old hoodie and had my suitcase. I think I looked homeless, and the owner immediately offered me a pastry and a coffee for free. It was very kind. I had already ordered the salmon toast, which was wonderful. Also, the place has the cozy vibes that all coffee shops (besides Starbucks) strive for."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Patricia! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Too much cacao on cappuccino so you do not taste the coffee anymore.  A pity.  Salmon toast is OK, not special. WiFi is available"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hi Arie,  Thanks for checking out our Front St Café and for taking the time to leave a review. We aussies are a bit rogue and put cocao on cappuccinos -- We will check in with the team in SF to make sure this hasn't gone overboard. Have you tried one of our flat whites? Hope to see you again soon to enjoy more of what Bluestone Lane has to offer.  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,My wife works near by so she brought me here today. Coffee was good and I was able to get a table to do some work at. Was a bit loud but cool place
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hi Joshua,  We are so glad to hear you got some work done in our Front St location with a delicious coffee in hand! We hope to see you back in one of our locations soon to have another great coffee and something to eat!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"If I could give them a 0 I would. I waited in line for 5 minutes to order a smoothie. After another 22 minutes it still had not come out. I finally inquired and they pointed to my receipt on the counter. The order had not even been started! Even at that point the staff did not seem concerned about expediting. I requested they cancel the order and refund me. There was no acknowledgement that I had been waiting nearly 30 minutes for a smoothie.  It takes me less than three minutes to make a smoothie at home. They seemed to be working on a few incoming order-ahead orders (which apparently take priority - I watched them come in long after my order was placed and get filled) so I was trying to be patient. My fault for not asking about the status sooner. I could have completed a conference call in the time it took to order, wait, and still have no breakfast. It was certainly not worth being late to work for."

Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"I went here twice over the weekend.  1. The coffee is great. If you're a blue bottle fan (I am), this is equally good. 2. I also tried the matcha latte on the second day that I went here, it was good. 3. My favourite here was the avocado toast. Nothing complex, simple bread with generous spread of fresh avocados served with salt and paprika drizzle on top.  My only minor complaint is that they charge you $1 extra for making your drink extra hot. I find that a bit strange. Else the place is a definitely worth a stop to grab a small bite or get a coffee."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Good coffee, but their cappuccino tasted almost like a mocha because of the cocoa powder on top. This particular branch is small, so it's cramped up inside, even just to pick up the order ahead coffee."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Thip! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"This is the right one of these coffee spots to visit as they do a full breakfast menu. I think the breakfast bowls are amazingly good, the coffee is spot on, and I enjoy the fact that they open at 7am for those of us with some jetlag who skipped dinner. I come here pretty often, and look forward to staying downtown so I am nearby."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Nice spot with good strong coffee and healthy options on the menu.  I had a rainbow bowl and added 2 eggs.  It was wonderful.   Spinach, goat feta and tomatoes.  So why not 5 stars?that comes from the staff who were a mixed bag and the pressure tip payment application - you know those applications that ask you to amount and have preset buttons for percentages.   I'm not sure when a counter order from a stuck up coffee jockey who does not make eye contact, smile or greet people became 18% but it's enough to keep this place off my list.  Tips = to insure proper service.   And yep if you want 18% for me to come to you to order and bus my own table at least you can smile."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hey Justin,  We're glad to hear you enjoyed your coffee and food at our Front St location! Thank you also for taking the time to write some feedback. We appreciate it and will implement it into our teams practice!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Clean, quiet. I like the presentation of their food and drink. I got the avocado toast and a golden latte. The toast was very bland. Maybe I didn't like the chunky version of an avocado toast, but it really wasn't special. The golden latte however was yum. From the kick of ginger and cinnamon, I thought it was the best to wake up to."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hey Arthur,  Thanks for stopping by our Front St Coffee Shop and for leaving a review! We're glad you liked our golden latte -- Sorry to hear that our avo smash wasn't quiet up to scratch -- I'll check in with the team at Front St. We'd love the opportunity to make it up to you and to hear your feedback on how we can improve. Please feel free to contact us at: feedback@bluestonelane.com. See you again soon!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"This is my first time here. They say they have free wifi but when you bring it up it asks all these invasive questions (email, first&last name, phone number, and date of birth!). I asked the waitress if that was right and she said yes. So I trusted it and went forward to get my work done. I wasn’t even done with my first email when it kicked me off and said I had reached my data limit. Then it wouldn’t let me log back in again. The associate wasn’t any help either and wouldn’t contact the managers because it was their “day off.” Very disappointed."

Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Typical millennial kind of place with an Australian vibe (avo toast, flat whites, no table service, yes I’m Australian). I ordered Avo with a poached egg. It was good. My order came in a box. I asked for a plate and they gave me a plastic cheese board. Am I getting old? Anyway, the toast was quite hearty and it made me wanna go chop logs. The Flat White was excellent. The PE was done perfectly medium. Good place with about 12 small tables and an obligatory community table."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, RC! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Creative brunch dishes on high quality toast. Their avocado, goat cheese, prosciutto and tomato is delicious. Great place for a quick bite in the morning, some room to sit or take to go."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Would give 6 stars if I could. I’ve been going here basically every morning before work for almost a year now and this place just gets better with time. Coffee shops will always be unpredictable: the morning FiDi crowd is inconsistent. But Bluestone handles it all with ease. Customer service is (and I can’t emphasize this enough) GOLDEN. As a regular customer, conversations with my baristas are a beautiful start to my workdays. Coffee is consistently quality, delicious, and well-balanced. Whether you’re looking for a new weekday routine or weekend plans, Bluestone is sure to fit the bill."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"As an Aussie this place disappoints tremendously. The team behind the counter were great but the food was terrible and the coffee meh. If you want low quality, prepared meals then this is your place. This is in no way saying that the NYC locations aren’t good (they are!)."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hi Marcel,  We are sorry you had a disappointing experience at our Front St location. We would love to chat with you a bit further about your experience to find a way to make it up to you. If you would like to send us an email at greetings@bluestonelane.com explaining a bit more in detail about your experience, we would really appreciate the further feedback.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,My go to breakfast place. Perfect coffee and lot of healthy breakfast to choose from. The staff is friendly and there is a good place to sit and eat peacefully. Does get bit crowded at times but the coffee and food is worth a visit if you are around Bluestone!
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Good coffee, great service, although there is consistently a gang of men doing drugs and harassing passersby (I recently saw a guy who appeared to be on drugs jump out and yell at some women, scaring the heck out of them.) All of this is right outside the coffee shop. The store should do more to get neighbors the help they need and to protect its customers from assault"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Are you kiding!! Best cafe place ever !!. My wife can not get out of the bed with her oat milk capacino extra hot to go !!!! My entire family lovely this place because my wife loves it. More importantly we love it because of the staff. A simple smile and a warm great and a pleasant good bye makes your day!!

We love to hear how much you are loving the location, coffee and our team. We really hope to see you back again in soon for another great coffee and Aussie vibes.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Cute Australian coffee shop.  There’s a nice ambiance with comfy couch seatings and small tables for two.  You can find people working on their laptops and even conducting interviews here. Lots of people who work in the FiDi just stop by here for grab and go coffee.  There’s usually a line but the baristas are really fast and your order is up in a few minutes.  I like their Iced Chocolate, Chai Latte and Red Beet Latte.  The bambinocino is a small shot with mocha (no espresso) that’s suitable for kids.   If you download their app for the first time you got a free five dollar credit!"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Brewed coffee was good. Prices out of line with the likes of Peet's. Space is somewhat small although we found a table right away at 2 pm.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,"Hi Catherine,  We're glad to hear you enjoyed your coffee and we appreciate the feedback you provided. We hope to see you back again soon to enjoy another great coffee.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"

Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,Great staff and service and great coffee (Double Piccolo) and I had the Avo toast which was great. I wish i added a poached egg or two.
