Higher Grounds Coffee House,The coffee is good. The food was cooked perfectly and was tasty. Friendly service. I’d recommend. It’s a place to relax and be patient. Be kind when you show up and you’ll get a tasty experience.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"This is my kinda place to eat. Casual and delicious. We sat in the window seat and tried all the kinds of crepes. I had the Florentine. Nothing about it is fast, so take you time and eat slow. It’s worth it!!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Cash only. This place is a delight! I love the atmosphere, and the crepes! Definitely a highlight of Glen Park. Limited outdoor seating is available and it's in a fun location.  My favorite crepe is the shrimp. In addition to a lot of shrimp, it also has tomato sauce, tomato, mushroom, capers, garlic, spices, mozzarella cheese, and lemon. It is so tasty and I love the capers. Crepes come with a side of home style potatoes and a spring mix salad with a refreshing and light dressing."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"I love this place! One man runs it all, he is truly amazing. The food is delicious, coffee is great. Always enjoy the atmosphere. Cash only so come compared. Definitely a great breakfast spot. Always leave with a happy and full stomach."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"I love this Cafe, great quality nice coffee. Remember to have cash/Venmo when you get there."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"I highly recommend going to this place. The people there are all very friendly and the atmosphere is very light hearted. This place is a one man show, taking orders in the front, making food in the open kitchen and keeping up the coffee. The (presumable) owner runs the shop on his own, so the food does take a bit of time. The customers did not seem to mind though, all of them seeming to be understanding. If you're in a rush, this place is not for you.  I ordered to go, getting a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, and it was very good. The cheese was gooey and melted all over inside of the egg. The bacon bits were plentiful enough that each bite I took, there was always some in it. The bagel was toasted well and was a good vessel for the protein. All in all, a good experience and nice to see local shops doing very well. I would come back and get a sit down meal next time."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Terrific coffee, mixed blends and iced cafe au lait was so good!! Espresso single shot was good too. Shrimp crepe: liked the capers! Friendly owner ! Especially liked the rustic deco and various monthly art work from local artists."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Cute and cozy place, friendly staff, and delicious crepes… tomato sauce is amazing, the food feels homemade and healthy… highly recommend, it’ll be one of my go to places."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,So happy they are back open!! All of the ingredients are fresh and delicious. I've had most of the crepes on the menu and you really can't go wrong though my faves are the pesto and cannelloni. Cash only but there are atms just around the corner. I've lived in the bay for years and this is hands down my favorite place for brunch! Still just as delicious to go for lockdown.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Left really upset and hungry. This man is running a business but didn't have his iPad out to check any door dash orders. I never got my food and had to leave empty-handed running late waiting 15 minutes to receive nothing
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Higher Grounds has become so special to me that I've celebrated two consecutive birthdays here simply to feel at home. The sole owner is also the server/cook/overall problem solver (he also owns two other businesses on the same block). This man is focused, a little introverted, and pushes out 10/10 crepes amazingly.  Higher Grounds is a must-try if you have time around Daly City."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"The place is very small, very busy, but very good. The coffee was absolutely incredible and there were so many omelettes! There were just 2 guys working, but they were hustling! Everything was amazing."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,It was recommended by the insured at my inspection and he told me to order the shrimp. At Higher Grounds I told the person (owner?) that I am celiac so he suggested that he put the shrimp into omelette. OMG!!!! My husband had it in a crepe and said it was the best crepe he'd ever had. This is our new go to when in San Francisco. Also the cappuccino was amazing.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Amazing crepes, good coffee, very nice people. One of the best places to go for breakfast or lunch in Glen Park. I recommend the curry crepe for a savory lunch, and one of the fruit crepes for a sweet breakfast."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Lovely old school joint, pulled off by a single talented employee, with a pot of tea and good coffee. Outdoor oarklet available."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"An institution. Nothing compares. Small homey place. Everything made right in front with top notch fillings and endless options. The best savory crepes in the city, no doubt.  Favorites include the salsa crepe, the pesto crepe (add chicken!), and the florentine. Hand crafted espressos and iced tea. Lots more.  One important note- they only accept cash."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Really nice authentic vibe, delicious coffee & food, one man operation so if it's busy expect to wait a bit, but he handled it very well, was efficient and extremely nice!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Very cozy little coffee shop. I had a bagel with cream cheese and tomato along with a Mexican hot chocolate. Both good.  No credit cards accepted yet (the owner said that might be coming), but they accept cash or Venmo, so you still have options."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Incredible food and a friendly staff. It was fun having such good food and service in a simple, inviting spot. Highly recommend the French toast!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Had the Alla Milanese crepe, which was delicious! The mocha was a generous portion, but not very rich."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Cute if a bit rustic. Food is pretty good and decor is charming. Pricing is reasonable. Needs a little modernization and would benefit from additional space; such is city life. Simplicity can be a workable vibe though.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Soooo goood!!!! Only thing is its so busy so you should wait probably a while
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Darn— our coffee was really a bummer! Ambiance was lovely, as was the location, but this won’t be our stop for lattes in the future 😢 …"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Stopped in to this blast from the past. It’s not a coffee shop (the name is misleading) but it is an awesome brunch spot with tons of crepe options. If I lived here, I’d be a regular."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Super cozy cafe with great breakfast sandwiches!
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"It was great going back yesterday!! It was so much cleaner than before!! I’m happy they are doing some outdoor dining but I wish they had indoor dining. Oh well. 25% capacity won’t do it. Maybe 50% or when it becomes 100% which will be like a year from now depending on what happens. Anyway enough politics I’m glad it’s reopened and the hot chocolate I’ve been getting since I was a child tastes just the same so I’m happy! If you haven’t, come in by, some of the best crepes in the city. Maybe the best in the Bay Area?!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Great coffee and the curry crepe was delicious. A quiet place to read or work. The owner was very friendly and the service was great.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Went on a Glenn park exploration day and a friend of mine recommended to try this place. She specifically mentioned to get the chicken crepe and it was good advice because the crepe was good... Just good not excellent, I think that the dish was missing something but overall I liked the taste and ate it all :) I didn't wait at all to get my crepe and it was brought to my table directly (you need to order at the counter). Overall the staff is very nice and my experience was positive."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,The food is always amazing! Such a treat.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Fantastic crepes. I got the Salsa Crepe which was loaded with incredibly flavorful tomatoes, avocados, and olives. The side potatoes and salad were delicious as well. The one man cashier/cook was quiet but nice and very polite. Would definitely come again!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,I've only ever had the pesto crepe and the croissant French toast because both are so tasty. The folks working there are friendly and fast. You may have to wait for a seat but usually something opens up by the time you get your food.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"An original delicious San Francisco cafe that has stood the test of time. The best savory and sweet crepes and breakfast dishes. I am so excited they have reopened! Take out only for now but go support Monhol and his delicious food!! I didnt realize he had reopened but was able to swing by today! My belly was so excited I did. Call to order, and he'll have it ready in 15 mins. Delicious! Please support them! We don't want to lose this special San Francisco treat!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"A very pleasant cafe open during the day that makes to order crepes both savory and sweet, one at a time on the open kitchen behind the counter.  Very hearty portions, all the savories come with potatoes.  Very good, smooth coffee.  The interior is all rustic wood, plants, glass windows, reminiscent of the 70s in a good way.  Very relaxed, and good place to read or study too.  Prices are very low."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,The food is so good. My bf and I took the train into the city and found this place a few blocks from Glen Park bart station. We ordered a savory crepe to share and there was plenty of food for the two of us because it came with a side of potatoes and a salad. We love this place so much that we stop in every time we are in the city. A true culinary gem.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"This feel like a unique place to breakfast. There were two older gentlemen in a tiny kitchen doing everything. It was like going to grandpa's house to eat. Very friendly service. The food was very home made, nothing fancy. Salad with came with our eggs, along with potatoes and toast. The atmosphere is very cozy but nice."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"The crepes are quite delicious, but didn't seem too filling. Between the 3 of us, we ended up getting 4 crepes and still weren't stuffed! Maybe they are just that good. We loved the Puttanesca, more than the Chicken Delight and the Eggplant, which were both good. We also enjoyed our nutella crepe. We were disappointed that they were out of the French Toast Croissant, otherwise we would've gotten that. Really tiny place so it gets crowded and you might have to wait, but I think the crowd cycles through fast. They ONLY take cash so be prepared to have enough dough - some of the crepes were pricey ($12-$15)."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Was looking for a local spot to stop in for laptop work. This little spot was too busy for that, but my faith in humanity was redeemed by the very kind proprietor and the friendly locals enjoying a slower-paced morning and chatting. Delicious fresh crepe which arrived with potatoes and salad was the best way to start a Monday. Just don’t forget your cash like I did!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Family run crêperie and there's usually only one or two people working the kitchen but it is totally worth it! Grab a seat when you can because sometimes it takes a while for people to leave.  I love bringing people visiting San Francisco to have breakfast here. It's low-key and the food is great!
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Cozy weary traveler coffee shop in Glen Park! Fairly small, but if you can snag a table for a cup of coffee and a crepe it’ll be worth it."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"I generally don’t take the time to write a negative review, but it’s also been a long time since I have received so much attitude from restaurant staff. They were not willing to make simple, small food alterations. The tables were dirty. The hot sauces bottles were all crusted over, presumably from being refilled over and over with out replacing them and the food wasn’t anything particularly noteworthy and the espresso tasted burnt."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"We didn't know where to go for lunch and ended up here about 1:30pm.  The place head a few occupied tables.   The menu is above the counter.   You have the choice of omelettes, crepes, some fresh pastries and coffee.   Order at the confer and then take a seat.   They only take cash here.   If you need there's a Bank of America ATM across the street.   I got the pesto crepe which came with some sad potatoes and a green salad.   The crepe was decent.  This was a nice afternoon spot to chat.   Since it was after the lunch crowd I didn't feel the rush to eat and get out of there."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Fantastic local spot with good food. There is group of regulars here that you can get to know while enjoying crepes and coffee. Just feels like a place lost in time with rotating art on the walls and pics of what Glen Park used to be.  Bring cash or stop by the ATM around the corner.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"[from July 2006]  The decor isn't all that special (actually a little dark for my tastes), but the food is scrumptious and the owner is friendly.  My favorite so far has been a crepe I ""created"":  cheddar cheese, feta, ham, pesto, and onions.  Yum!!!  Oh, and the fresh squeezed orange juice is great and plentiful.  Just know that it's served room temperature, so you won't be shocked when you take your first sip (I suppose you could always ask to have ice added).  The dessert crepes are tasty, too."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"I had the banana crepe with creme fraiche, brown sugar and cinnamon. It was light, crispy and not overly sweet. I also ordered a cafe latte. I love this cozy, family run cafe and would come back again whenever I visit San Francisco. Highly recommended!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Great place. We had an omlete and a crepe (strawberries and Nutella) and coffee. Everything tasted great and was made fresh when we ordered. Service was friendly and patient, the atmosphere was very pleasant. We will definitely try to come again."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Delicious crepes. I go for the savory ones, alla Toscana is my favorite. Cash Only! There's a Wells Fargo and Bank of America (or even convenience store ATM) on the block if you forget. Wish it were a little bigger, seating can be hard to come by, but that's part of the charm."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"This is the best breakfast and lunch place, superb crepes made to order potatoes and whatever else you want is right there in the heart of the Glen Park Neighborhood, across the street is the dry cleaners, across from them is the newly reopened dinner used to be Tiger's, then across from that is Buddies Market where you can find just about anything you're looking for best little neighborhood around SF !"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,I was dumb and didn’t realize it was cash only until after my latte had already been made. I didn’t have cash on me but the folks working here let me keep my drink anyway. The least I can do is write a good review. Planning on going back next time I’m in the area so that I can pay them back!
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Had a banana Nutella crepe and coffee in this neat little joint. Very good. Was just passing through the city but I could tell this is a well established shop with a lot of 'regulars'. Would definitely visit again.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,The sweetest gentleman served us a steaming hot fresh brewed cup of coffee and literally cut the oranges to make my OJ right in front of us. I can only imagine how delicious the crepes must be!
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"This place is fantastic. Unlike some cafes, their sandwich-y / hot food options are great. Get lunch here, then go to Glen Canyon Park!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Great food and service. Only constructive criticism is the dining area is often cold on cold days due to the door being open. I know the kitchen gets hot but keep the customers in mind, guys."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"awesome the putanesca was to die for. delicious, flavorful. we also got the salsa crepe and the croissant french toast. I highly recommend all of them and will most definitely come back"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"The coffee is excellent,  rich and creamy,  and yes , good coffee can be creamy!!! I don't know about the food,  I'm stuck with the shrimp crepes.  Cozy little place."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,Even though we are not locals we make a point to eat here every time we visit.  We like the mom and pop place where the locals eat.  We have tried a few of their dishes and we have always enjoyed what we've ordered.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Really good latte. Nice and friendly service. I recommend it. It's in a pretty little neighborhood. Didn't eat food , but it looked healthy and delicious."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,I found two long black hairs cooked into my crepe. It was disgusting. I showed the owner and he quickly scraped the food into the trash and called me a liar. I was shocked.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Found this place while we were out walking around the neighborhood. The ambiance was comfortable and home-y, the staff was very welcoming and friendly, and the coffee was excellent! A very simple, nice place to hang out!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,"Love this place! Amazing food in a small, cozy spot. (e.g. sometimes hard to get a table). Very welcoming atmosphere. I always stop by when I’m in town."

Higher Grounds Coffee House,Great omelettes and coffee! The chef works all by himself and is very friendly - it’s cash only. Loved the cafe decoration and friendliness.

Higher Grounds Coffee House,"I have been a loyal customer, since I was a teenager. When I had my children, they ate there and now my grandchildren. The food just keeps getting better with time."
