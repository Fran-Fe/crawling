Sightglass Coffee,"Bet it’s great in the summer. Arrived here around 8:15 to grab a cup of coffee and take in the city vibe (I live out of town). It’s 40 degrees and the door is open so while it’s a beautiful place by design, it’s got a cold vibe and was actually cold. Indoor seating is very minimal and awkward so if you’re into sitting for a moment and enjoying yourself and coffee this isn’t the place. The coffee … got the vanilla paste latte w/ almond milk. Very good but got cold within minutes."
Sightglass Coffee,Sight glass coffee is a quaint coffee shop that serves a cup of coffee FULL of flavor. My hazelnut latte was crafted ever so perfectly and the shop is done up super well and everyone was super friendly. A hot cup of coffee is the perfect addition to a chilly San Fransisco morning.
Sightglass Coffee,"Tasteful, elegant space with high ceilings and table seating for writing or typing. Well-prepared coffee, extensive selection of sweet and savory pastries."
Sightglass Coffee,Limited seating. Clean aesthetic. It’s in a cute neighborhood in the Mission.
Sightglass Coffee,My current favorite coffee place! One of the few places here where the espresso based coffee doesnt taste too acidic and its smokey! A bit pricey compared to other places
Sightglass Coffee,Very cool coffee shop in the Mission neighborhood.  Lots of drink options and fresh pastries from a local bakery.  Tried their iced latte with real vanilla. Different than vanilla syrup you get at most coffe shops this was very floral and unique.  COVID protocols are being followed as masks are required in the cafe and until you are drinking or eating your item(s)
Sightglass Coffee,"Never have had a bad cup of coffee here. I typically get an espresso drink and they make it perfect each time. I haven't been disappointed yet. You can come here and know you're getting a good cup of joe. My only gripe is the parking. Not the fault of the place, but I have had to park a block or two away, which I'm not comfortable with. It's only because I don't live in the city and don't know the neighborhoods all that well. But I keep coming back."
Sightglass Coffee,An homage to the coffee bean and its treatment. Perfection is close here. Worth going out of your way for this spot!
Sightglass Coffee,"Really good coffee. Very little vegan options: granola with alternative milk - that was disappointing, I hope they offer more in the future. Their guava pastry is very good according to my friends! The cafe itself is very beautifully decorated and there is both outdoor and indoor seating. Very peaceful spot too."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice coffee, great atmosphere! Had a nice cold brew and enjoyed the place!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Just off the corner of 20th and Alabama  is this nicely decorated coffee shop.  You can walk a few blocks, where they have more parking a d it's safe (REMEMBER not to leave ANYTHING for people to see in your car in the city) They have indoor and outdoor setting (there is more outdoor and its covered too), bathrooms and the line moves quickly.  There are plenty of espresso machines to get you your drink quickly.   The pastry selection is respectful.  If you are looking for a good espresso drink, you will be alright. Side note their cortado is more like a flat white  One cool note is the floor. Of there are not a lot of people, you can see it and it looks nice."
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee was alright, but my overall experience was totally ruined by the rude staff. The cashier lady in particular was very unfriendly and disinterested in taking orders, let alone answering any questions. It was as though my coffee order got in the way of their leisurely time checking their phones.  The whole atmosphere was just so unwelcoming that I almost felt like leaving without the $6 latté.  Obviously, won't be going back here."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of the nicest coffee places in SF, really good Americano and great seating indoor and out."
Sightglass Coffee,Coffee is ok but not at the same level as other SF places like Four Barrel or Blue Bottle. Poor milk frothing and slightly too bitter coffee. Staff is a bit too cool for you to actually engage. The space is very nice though and invites you to spend some time here.
Sightglass Coffee,"There aren't many seatings but among several Sightglass branches in SF, I like this one the most. Nice atmosphere w/ good coffee. A cute place."
Sightglass Coffee,Beautiful coffee and food. Service is prompt and friendly. Nice outdoor seating. Overall great experience.
Sightglass Coffee,A lovely local coffee shop. Good service. Good coffee. Guava pastry is quite delicious. Minimal seating area. Nice atmosphere.
Sightglass Coffee,Love itself. Amazing coffee and pastry selection (but come early for that!). The perfect neighborhood coffee joint. Exquisite exquisite coffee consistently.
Sightglass Coffee,Nice little cozy coffee shop.  Hand made coffee with indoor roasting machine.  First time there and I will go again.
Sightglass Coffee,"As a coffee shop, 5 stars. Love that they seem to rock vinyl all day. However, trivial as it sounds, no wifi means 4 stars. Excellent coffee though!"
Sightglass Coffee,We love that they roast their own coffee and are serious about it. Macchiato was good . Iced vanilla paste had great vanilla flavor but should have ordered with an extra shot. Pistachio croissant was incredible! Flaky with Pistachio nuts and almond paste with raspberry jam. Staff not overly friendly but helpful. Plenty of space
Sightglass Coffee,Really great spot for third wave coffee. Great pour over and a good espresso. Seating is limited. Some baristas are better than others. Overall I like this place.
Sightglass Coffee,"Yeah, whatever. Generally expertly crafted in a great space that's both walkable and there's a good amount of free on-street parking. As you'd expect, it's expensive. They're friendly. The restrooms are clean, though the shared, multi-stall sort. There's excellent seating outdoors 😷😷.  My gripe, and this may be by design, is there is no wifi. Sure, I want excellent coffee and a delicious pastry, but I pay what you ask for the opportunity to do some life administration on your wifi...while sipping your excellent coffee and mawing a good pastry. There's no table service, so why have such a nice space and no wifi? It can still be the community space while some folks get their work done (and it's not that big of a community space with fancy and pricey coffee and goods... it's just for the well-to-dos).  3 stars for a nice space and good roasted bean infusion."
Sightglass Coffee,Cozy little place with a cup of warming coffee. It is my first time there and worth to give it a try.
Sightglass Coffee,I came here as part of Branson's Airbnb coffee tour and I loved the how lofty the space is. Pour over coffee served here is great and loved the Guatemalan roasted beans. Coffee beans are roasted here on site and would be my choice of coffee to go if I'm in the area.
Sightglass Coffee,"Wonderful Chia latte, Vanilla latte, and matcha latte. Cozy interior environment and friendly service."
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent coffee in a sweet little shop. Their espresso was dialed in very well and the drip was tasty!
Sightglass Coffee,"Cold Croissant for $6.75! I specifically asked for it to be warmed up (who eats cold artisan croissants?) I am European and this is considered disgusting or cheap. I was told that they don't even have an oven to heat it up 🤦‍♀️.  Fine, you can sell cold artisan patisserie BUT then charge for it something under $3 not $6.75 ( without tax)!. Don't charge premium for European patisserie and then serve it in barbarian style.  What a hipster disaster.  Matcha coffee was ok."
Sightglass Coffee,"The best coffee in San Francisco! They don't over-roast to keep the complex flavors. I recommend going there at 3pm on a Friday to do a coffee ""tasting"" called a Cupping."
Sightglass Coffee,"Visit: Oct. 9th @4pm  -1 Negative one star for the appallingly aggressive woman barista (female, short brunette pixie cut spoke with a heavy accent) who got our drinks wrong. I was very delicate with her and told her my daughter and my drink was possibly not correct as we weren't tasting nor smelling any vanilla notes in their Vanilla Latte. She rationed out a very small amount of vanilla and when I politely asked for an allotment for my daughter's latte - I mean we did PAY $14 for Two VANILLA LATTES THAT WE DIDNT GET, she barked in a very condescending manner and FLAT OUT REFUSED.  5 stars for Francisco, the gentleman that had originally greeted us at the door, presented us with the menu and ultimately made the recommendation for the Vanilla Latte with a bit of extra vanilla rushed in for the chivalrous save. I was so shocked at the barista's aggressive response, I knew not how to respond in the moment. I handed both drinks to Francisco to inspect since the batista effectively charged me with lying and he could tell the vanilla had been omitted. Unlike his peer, he acted with an air of diplomacy and a heavy dose of kindness in an attempt to circumvent her disgusting behavior.  The coffee is smooth on the palate and non acidic. Very nice - unlike her obnoxious service. Her anger and insults don't pair well with the goodness of their coffee. As the final note, she blasted the music (that was not on previously BTW) in an attempt to drown out me conveying my concerns which made Google Reviews the optimal feedback mechanism.  Sightglass Management, take urgent notice."
Sightglass Coffee,"Small, neighborhood spot I stopped by since I’m visiting and because I’m a fan of the way they roast their coffee. Americano was good, staff was friendly. Only drawback is that it’s small (it’s pretty though) and doesn’t have much seating! Doesn’t seem like there’s any Wi-Fi either."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of our favorite coffee shops in the city, which happens to be across the street from us. There is rarely much of a line, which is a plus.  The space inside is absolutely beautiful, though much smaller than their SoMA location, with only limited seating. The custom shelving, the tiles, all wonderful design features. Their outdoor parklet that was built during COVID is a fantastic addition.  Their coffee is always great. It’s not the best there is out there, but it’s generally 85% percentile or better. Great tasting notes and they don’t go overboard with the brightness like some of the other roasters in the city. One of the few where espresso, espresso-based drinks, quick cups, pour over all are pretty great, rather than some outshining others.  Their pastries tend to be great as well. They source from a few bakeries, and they almost never go wrong."
Sightglass Coffee,What nice coffee roaster. I love here’s interiors!
Sightglass Coffee,"Very limited seating. Had to request my coffee to-go since I couldn’t find a seat. A very small cappuccino for $4.50, not worth it."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good vibes, but there’s No WiFi & they don’t serve chai. So I ordered a macchiato, and it was the smallest macchiato ever. I would recommend if you are there to read or meet with someone but not to camp and work."
Sightglass Coffee,"Always good coffee and good service. I think the service at this location is a little better and more personable than their flagship store (7th ave I think). They have good pastries, including seasonable ones from a local bakery. While the coffee and plain espresso drinks are excellent, they have a vanilla paste latte and vanilla cold brew that are a step above. They taste of real vanilla (because it is) rather than syrup or extract. Also they love my dog"
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite coffee shop anywhere. Every detail is perfect. And the coffee is perfect too, of course."
Sightglass Coffee,"It was a day like any other when I decided I’d stop into this cool, trendy new coffee shop I’ve heard so much about. I walk into this shop at 11:34 in the morning and the bravest, strongest young person is there to ask me what I would like, and follow through to the end. Strong and firm as the Tower of Babble, but with a aire of delicate sensibility, they stood, with poise, to take my order. I asked specifically for ote milk in my cofe, and you know what I got? Exactly what I wanted. That’s dedication. That’s work ethic. That’s drive. There was another person there too who made my drink and they were good too."
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee and space was really good but unfortunately the staff were very unfriendly. I paid for the order and they completely ignored it for no reason??? I asked is my coffee ready, and they were like oh you want coffee we can make one for you. I still don’t understand why"
Sightglass Coffee,"rude, rude, hipster women cashier. every time I come in, this one specific cashier throws shade... always rude, talks down. everyone else is nice and friendly, but this one chick got issues.   it's just coffee... stop being a rude hag you are runing the experience"
Sightglass Coffee,🌞
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee we had in SF. Their espresso blend “Owls Howl” is delicious. Had the best cortado ive had in a while. Would highly recommend visiting any of their locations.
Sightglass Coffee,Very cool setting with great coffee but limited seating and a bit pricey.
Sightglass Coffee,This place is great! I just moved to the area and went in and everyone was so nice. I got the vanilla latte and the potato pastry and both are fantastic! don't miss out on this place
Sightglass Coffee,While a bit that type of SF environment at least their higher prices is justified coffee wise. Had a cookie that was not very good though.
Sightglass Coffee,Their coffee was great and a little cheaper than Starbucks.
Sightglass Coffee,Ok super cool spot. Amazing interior and chill place to hang out with patio seating. Coffee was medium body and easy to drink in a cappuccino. Very good flavor in coffee and cool latte art.
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee here tastes amazing. However, I visited in September and the inside was like an oven, with little ventilation. The decor is brilliant and I love the high ceiling and windows, but it's just not comfortable to stay in for long. Add on the fact that signal doesn't reach well inside, there's little seating and there's no restroom, I can't see myself coming here to just sit and do something for a long while."
Sightglass Coffee,"I felt happy and delighted when I roamed my eyes and found out that the entire shop was clean, comfortable, and stylish. The coffee and the egg sandwich that I ordered was tasty and yummy. I thanked the waitress that served my order correctly and nicely. Also, I will definitely be back in here again and again!"
Sightglass Coffee,"It has a great ambience! Nicely decorated. But no outlet & no Wi-Fi. Not sure if it’s intentionally trying to deter people to work from the cafe, hence one star off."
Sightglass Coffee,"They have a very unique hot chocolate.  It's not super sweet, but it has a very strong chocolate flavor.  The interior is very well decorated, but the seating is limited.  They roast their own beans here, so the coffee has a distinct flavor.  Parking can be a challenge, but it's definitely worth it."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee in SF. Interesting location. Good customer service and great quality coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee we had in the last few days :) thank you
Sightglass Coffee,"Love the coffee, but they should be more mindfull of the environment. So horrible they are importing water from Italy!"
Sightglass Coffee,This siteglass is in a delightfully shaded corner of a quaint neighbourhood in San Francisco. Quite the find! Oh- And the coffee was divine.
Sightglass Coffee,"One of my favourite coffee shops in the city. In a really nice, friendly neighbourhood location. Always a great array of freshly baked pastries. The interior is beautiful. If you definitely want a seat you might need to share with others, which contributes to the overall friendly vibe."
Sightglass Coffee,"Love this café! Sightglass makes my favorite beans in the city, hands-down. The baristas here are nice, and the space is airy and pleasant. Even the pastries (from Neighbor Bakehouse, I believe) are delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice little quiet place for a cup of coffee!  As long as you get there before the neighborhood wakes up....  Very enjoyable cappuccino.  Decor is modern and clean, not a ton of seating.  Sitting out front would be the way to go, on a sunny/warm day."
Sightglass Coffee,Better to order a cappuccino instead of a cortado to which I am already accustomed :)
Sightglass Coffee,Amazing cold brew! It is a very relaxing atmosphere to sit and talk with a friend or read. They have very little seating. Pastries and small bites sell out so come early if you want something to go with your coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"The quality of the coffee is top notch. Both the selection of drinks and the equipment (beans, coffee, merch, as a roaster and supplier as well as a coffee shop) is great. The difficulty here is finding enough seating, and it's not a place that you can work inside of for a long time unless it's not super crowded. Otherwise, awesome -- I will always love Sightglass."
Sightglass Coffee,"Is used to be the best coffee in San Francisco to me. However, their full closure during the COVID-19 shutdown does not bode well with me. Will not go there again. There are many small coffee shops and restaurants who stayed opened and supported local community with their service through this crisis. As a token of appreciation to those local businesses I will shop only there."
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee in area and I tried a bunch of places during my stay in the Mission District.  Very friendly staff and the coffee was outstanding.  I appreciated the fact staff was not snobbish.  I am an avid coffee drinker order beans from all over the country and do all the stuff avid drinkers do to get a good brew.  But I hate coffee shop snobbery.   Coffee is so subjective and their are quite a few shops in the Mission District.   If you love coffee and are in the Mission District you can't go wrong here.
Sightglass Coffee,"So glad there’s a Sightglass out here. A perfectly designed location with brilliant espresso coffee. Loved it on 7th, love it here too."
Sightglass Coffee,"My friend ordered a cappuccino and I had a latte. Both were excellent, although the cups seemed on the small side. Decor has a clean appearance, with high ceilings, allowing plenty of light to penetrate, even at 7am. The reception/cashier guy was friendly and interactive.  The only negative aspect I can report is that, due to an unusual SF heat wave, the front door had to be kept open to allow sufficient ventilation. However, this allowed kamikaze flies to enter, eventually driving us out of the café."
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful place to chill, read, drink coffee. Good atmosphere, not a lot of people working on laptops, which is nice. The pastries are kind of overpriced, but that's par for the course these days, and everything is delicious, especially the kimchee bun. The double height space and interior design are really great."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice little coffee shop. There is some seating maybe enough for 10, but it can get full at times so you probably will just squeeze in with someone else at one of the small tables. All good though. Pastries and coffee are good, per the usual Sightglass."
Sightglass Coffee,Love small coffee shop. Very comfortable
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, but the atmosphere is dry with an air of separation. Seating is limited. The staff stood talking to each other, blocking access to the counter.  . Four stars though they make excellent coffee drinks"
Sightglass Coffee,"The latte from Sightglass was probably the best latte I've ever had. The place is elegant, complex, smells great and is very cozy. This location is small and seating is limited. Coffee and pastries are best taken to-go. Dog friendly."
Sightglass Coffee,"Always great coffee, one of my favorite roast! Great selection of drinks and beans."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee, rude service. I was the only one who managed to say thank you after I spent $20 on a bag of beans, and the cashier didn’t even respond to the thanks 😂 I guess you can’t be hipster without being rude."
Sightglass Coffee,"Staff was good, coffee was good. However I asked for here but got it to go, there was no seating, it was hard seeing the entrance when driving by as it's behind some trees, and good luck finding parking. Wish there was a 4.5 stars, but I'll round up because sightglass is definitely a must go in SF."
Sightglass Coffee,"Exceptional roast quality.  Espresso extraction technique is usually on point, milk always steamed well, foam has great consistency.  Overall great place for coffee if you are a coffee aficionado."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee 👍👌👌👌best flat white in town! …
Sightglass Coffee,"Too expensive and the quantity of coffee is very less. Not enough tables to site either. I had to sit outside. Wanted to get some pastry, but they only had two vegan. Yes literally just two piece in the entire place.  Coffee was good though. Will not return.."
Sightglass Coffee,"Another coffeeshop with small seating area, but with outdoor seating as well. The prices are average for coffee, but I got the pistachio croissant and it wasn't worth it...it was overbaked and hard to eat and cut.  This isn't a place to hang out for a while (nor is there wifi), it's more grab-n-go or just socialize for a minute and then leave."
Sightglass Coffee,"2015.11.27: Spent Black Friday morning here doing work on my laptop.  Love the decor and openness!  People were super-friendly, coffee was strong and not sweet at all, and the pastries were great!  Only downsides: no WiFi and no outlets."
Sightglass Coffee,"Cozy environment, friendly help and fast service. Not sure if there is WiFi Limited indoor seating Outdoor seating with a cover too!  Will be back when in the area."
Sightglass Coffee,"Just had a delicious, fragrant, complex mocha. They also have decent pastries and a few healthy options (chilled veggie bowls, interesting sparkling waters) as well."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great locally roasted coffee. Their single source bean game is strong, and if you have the option I would always go for the single source version of whatever coffee beverage you go for if you want to get a unique flavor experience. Friendly and knowledgable baristas too (this has changed for the better recently)"
Sightglass Coffee,"Cute little coffee shop with yummy coffee for those of you who are discerning. The one caveat: there is very limited seating. So this is great if you want a cup to go, but can make for an awkward date spot. I know this firsthand. 😬 …"
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass Coffee located on 20th St. is my favorite coffee shop I've ever been to, let along in SF. I went there on my last visit to SF and had a great time. The design and attention to detail is incredible. They have two espresso machine's, a small batch roaster, water on tap, tiled floors, great lighting, built in shelfs and great light - medium roasted coffee! Judging on overall ascetics of a shop, this one beats all the rest."
Sightglass Coffee,Love it. One of my favorite coffee shops in SF
Sightglass Coffee,"Attentive, great coffee and even better almond cake (my perdition). The prices were not bad and the designis superb. I'd get here to do some work or chat to my friends. I love their woody decor too."
Sightglass Coffee,Sightglass is still my favorite coffee in SF and the new location does not disappoint! I love grabbing a cup of black coffee (whatever is new and exciting) and an espresso. Perfect any time of day.
Sightglass Coffee,Beautiful location and delicious coffee. I love to get here early when they first open to grab a seat. By 10 am on the weekends it's packed! Would love to see a parklet for more seating! 🌳☕ …
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and even better vibes ☕️
Sightglass Coffee,"I wish this place had WiFi. I really do. The drinks here are your standard pricier coffee fare--I think it's $4 a latte? but they're really good! The space is really neat and open, so you can see all the machinery. It's really too bad about no wi-fi, but it doesn't seem they need it to attract the crowds. One time I came here around 10 on a weekday and the line was out the door because a whole group from a startup did a field trip for sightglass."
Sightglass Coffee,"I have nothing against the cafe, but their front door's handle smashed my finger! Horrible design. Don't close the left door with your right hand, because if you don't let go the other door's handle will smash your finger as the door very quickly pulls itself closed."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good atmosphere, great coffee and wonderful pastries"
Sightglass Coffee,"Look for a forest green-like storefront with black vertical numbers labelled ""3014"" on the left of the entrance, with a window and bench to the right as there is not a sign out front.  The interior decor is impeccable - simple, modern, and cozy just like the coffee and pastries served. Communal seating is available amongst a few interior tables."
Sightglass Coffee,My first time at this location and I really loved the atmosphere. Friendly staff. The coffee and donut were wonderful.
Sightglass Coffee,"I'm rating this as a coffee & working location. It's too small to use as a place to do work, but it has great coffee & service. It has more of a social vibe. It's a nice place for chatting at the bench outside."
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite coffee in San Francisco has to be sightglass. If you’re looking for a great place to catch up with a friend, or you’re showing a visitor around the city, definitely make a stop st a sightglass. The place doesn’t have WiFi which makes it perfect for IRL conversations, not for online ones. On top of top quality coffee, they have beautiful interiors (this one in the mission is on the smaller side) and the loveliest baristas. Though on the pricy side, I’d say it’s worth it!"
Sightglass Coffee,"The masala chai was soo tasty, loved the out doir aeating with trees."
Sightglass Coffee,The coffee here is always perfect. Just as good as a good coffee back home in Australia. And picking up through their window is convenient and safe.
Sightglass Coffee,The coffee here is one of my favorites in the city. I always try to visit when I'm back! Also love the decor and ambiance at this location.
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and atmosphere
Sightglass Coffee,"The service was polite without being overbearing, the staff were professional and timely and the coffee was made perfectly by an expert barista. However, the espresso was good but very very acidic."
Sightglass Coffee,"Very nice atmosphere. Good service. Coffee is delicious. In do wish there were more tables, but it was not over crowded."
Sightglass Coffee,"My husband and I still talk about this coffee place. Probably one of the best we have been to in this country, and we have been to a lot. The most delicious almond milk latte I have ever had."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice decor, but windows and doors wide open made the place feel very cold and damp. Benches are very uncomfortable. Beverages are great, but very small, therefore not very good value. Croissant was not fresh."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sitting outside on the bench is my favorite of all the SF cafe perches. Sightglasd has great coffee, great pastries, and a lovely space inside and out."
Sightglass Coffee,"Loves to close for entire days while not bothering to update their website or Google Maps. Luckily, they post a note on their window so you find out after traveling there."
Sightglass Coffee,My favorite way to start a Saturday. Often get the espresso con panna. I've never been disappointed. Love this little 'hood in the Mission.
Sightglass Coffee,Sightglass typical great coffee. Nice miami vibe and great pastries (e.g. Dynamo Donut). Wait was a little long.
Sightglass Coffee,beautiful artisanal coffee! just like in nz
Sightglass Coffee,"Almost nowhere better to caffeinate in the whole city of San Francisco. Great coffee and snacks, friendly staff, comfortable seating, and plenty of natural light."
Sightglass Coffee,Epic coffee. Super rad spots
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and pastries. High ceiling and lots of light make the small space feel big. Spot your favorite tech celeb popping in for a ☕️.
Sightglass Coffee,Huge hype on the internet about this place but the coffee turned out quite disappointing both the pour over I was served there and the beans I bought for home. If you don’t care this much about your coffee then it’s a nice place to chill in.
Sightglass Coffee,"❤️ aroma when roasting. Variety of origins & blends, excellent pastries, minimalist high quality fitout. Coffee 5. Pastries 5. Atmosphere 5. Service 5."
Sightglass Coffee,Great cortado - best coffee I’ve had in SF ✨
Sightglass Coffee,One of the best coffee fixes in town that guarantees you coming back for more! Not to mention the place is a sight for sore eyes and the service is wonderful!
Sightglass Coffee,"Small, mostly unassuming coffee shop with really good coffee. I was pretty underwhelmed by the croissant I ordered, but that may have been a function of me visiting them in the afternoon."
Sightglass Coffee,Coffee was  pretty. Good. Not a fan of the cold brew. I would recommend the place add some syrups to add just a bit of sweetness.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great for coffee snobs, but a bit expensive for me. I only went here because it was a holiday and my usual places were closed."
Sightglass Coffee,Love this coffee shop. It is definitely on the trendy side of things but the coffee quality is as great as the Instagram pictures you'll get.
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee. This place us buzzing! Lots of delicious pastries too. Another great coffee joint in SF
Sightglass Coffee,"The place is very well decorated but you would have a hard time enjoying it. There's very little sitting, No Wifi, No restroom."
Sightglass Coffee,"Located in a quiet neighborhood, this coffee shop is a great place for a afternoon hangout. Good coffee and comfortable chairs!"
Sightglass Coffee,"This comparatively unknown Sightglass location is just as good as 7th Street and, unlike 7th Street, isn't a massive greenhouse that gets insanely hot during the day.  Bring your dog."
Sightglass Coffee,"Love it! Style, passion, coffee!!!"
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent coffee. This location is smaller than the SOMA space. It can get a bit crowded. You still get the same delicious coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good espresso, house blend and single origin options. One of my regular espresso destinations."
Sightglass Coffee,Cute and fancy coffee shop in Mission. Drinks taste nice and the outside bench on a nice day is amazing. Recommend!
Sightglass Coffee,I like this smaller sight glass coffee shop more than the one on 7th St Soma. It's much cozier. The coffee is always good!
Sightglass Coffee,One of the coffee places that everyone should visit in SF. They also have amazing pastries.
Sightglass Coffee,Very fancy coffee options with great working areas. Perfect place for casual business meetings for small groups.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, great food! Love the outdoor seating parklet!"
Sightglass Coffee,Nice location.  There are a lot of great restaurants near by and I love sight glass coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,I know this is a highly rated place but I was underwhelmed by the flavors I tried. It's not super pricey so continue going if it's in your neighborhood.
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite coffee place in SF so far! Loved the coffee, the service and the amazing interior design."
Sightglass Coffee,"Cool place, good shot of espresso,vintage stereo and vinyl. I would want to be seen here if I were as cool  as the crowd that frequents."
Sightglass Coffee,Decent coffee and good pastries
Sightglass Coffee,They serve coffee and pastries but if you want Splenda or stevia or something sugar free they don't have it. All they have is sugar.
Sightglass Coffee,Great space. Tasty savory pastries. Try the sauerkraut cheddar tart if you're avoiding meat.
Sightglass Coffee,"Second best coffee in the city.  Unfortunately, they don't carry Owl's Howl or other roasts available from the SOMA location."
Sightglass Coffee,"The vanilla iced cold brew (with whole milk or almond milk) is great, as is the hand-pour drip coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,"The smaller sibling to the sightglass coffee on 7th, this place is the go to coffee destination while working in the area. Fast friendly service."
Sightglass Coffee,Holy hell their coffee is so damn good. Always a huge fan of their Latte!
Sightglass Coffee,Food and coffee are great but not a good place to linger. The seating is limited and pretty crowded.
Sightglass Coffee,"Delicious coffee. But beware: limited seating, no other drinks besides coffee/espresso (no tea, for example), and no WiFi."
Sightglass Coffee,Staff are friendly and make me want to come back. Coffee is good too!
Sightglass Coffee,Worst atmosphere because it was a toaster inside. Don’t plan on staying to enjoy the steep prices too long.
Sightglass Coffee,They definitely know how to prepare coffee here and the pastry options are excellent. Try the everything croissant!
Sightglass Coffee,Really good coffee and pastries. Pretty quick too...the line is never ridiculous. Not much seating.
Sightglass Coffee,Not your typical sf cafe.  Best cup I've had in the city.  It's worth the $7
Sightglass Coffee,Gorgeous space and delicious coffee! Truly one of the best in the country.
Sightglass Coffee,Good and friendly service. Nice atmosphere. And pretty decent coffee
Sightglass Coffee,"Most people like it but I find it a bit too acidic. The location is great though, nice and spacious."
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent coffee in a very lovely cafe if not a little pretentious.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, travestious hours. Some of us need coffee after 3pm stop judging me!"
Sightglass Coffee,Fabulous coffee at an excellent price. Also like their taste in tunes.
Sightglass Coffee,Cold coffee was acrid; pastry was stale; no WiFi. ☹️
Sightglass Coffee,"If you are into Coffee and happen to be in SF, you gotta try visit Sight glass. Really nice coffee"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, great everything croissants!"
Sightglass Coffee,Grab your (excellent) coffee and trot upstairs to the balcony seating for some of the best people watching in the city. Hipster bingo!
Sightglass Coffee,"Light, airy, clean atmosphere. Interesting brews. Only thing is that I wish there was more seating..."
Sightglass Coffee,Why is my iced coffee chalky?? Just not good.
Sightglass Coffee,A great place to get a cup of coffee. The vanilla iced coffee is delicious.

Sightglass Coffee,Sparkling ㅡ plum + ketchup taste Blue Moon - Ah Vanilla flavored coffee - Vanilla flavored coffee  Conclusion: So
Sightglass Coffee,"T: Similar to the main store. However, it is natural for coffee that the taste changes depending on the storage of the beans, so I unfortunately did not feel the taste that I ate at the main store. However, the milk's velvety cream was really satisfying. Art was asymmetrical, but the taste of coffee always came first. S: In fact, I ask questions with poor English, and they helped me a lot. Also, like the main store, there are unique employees and I think everyone has more than basic skills. You can trust whoever makes the coffee. C: Since the size of the store itself is not large compared to the number of people, I thought the cleaning was good. But there seems to be a rush hour. Considering the rush time and various points, it seems that the number of employees is appropriate and the cleanliness is appropriate. A cafe that will satisfy you in many ways"
