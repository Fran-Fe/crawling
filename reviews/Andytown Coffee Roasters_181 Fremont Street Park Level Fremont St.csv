Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I’m so glad I don’t have to go all the way to the sunset for andytown anymore! And even more glad there is another third wave option other than Nestle’s Blue Bottle. This location is everything - right on the Transbay Park so it’s a perfect spot to start your morning before work.  They also sell coffee beans (8oz as opposed to 12oz that most shops sell) and a small selection of brewing equipment, mugs, and greeting cards. This is the only place I’ll get a pumpkin spice latte, they partner with oaktown spice for seasonal drinks."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,I got the snow bird with less sugar. Do NOT drink without mixing it. The whipped cream is very good! Otherwise it’s a bizarre but interesting drink. The latte is average.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Get here through the public elevator in 181 Fremont or via the sky bridge. Be prepared for long lines! The coffee is excellent though and they offer a huge variety of beans for you to purchase.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"We ordered coffee and breakfast sandwiches to-go on a Saturday morning. I was surprised to see when we got here that Andytown is on the 7th floor of the building, on the same level as Salesforce park. It has a lovely interior vibe, good for coworking with ambient music and space. The breakfast sandwich was good with thick sourdough bread and warm melted cheese. However, they gave us ham instead of bacon, and I thought it didn’t have enough “filling” to match the density of the bread. Drip coffee was tasty. Overall, felt full and satisfied after. Order ahead experience was seamless and easy."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I love this coffee place. It’s a nice stop for a coffee break while strolling Salesforce park and they have some unique drinks like the Original Bird. It’s like a Sparkling Americano.  I’m a sparkling water junkie so I have to get the Original Bird (espresso, sparkling water, brown syrup, and whipped cream). Unsweetened for me, but add that extra cream because it’s so good and mixes smoothly into your drink with each sip! So yummy."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I recently visited Andytown Coffee Roasters and tried their Original Bird cold brew, and I must say, it completely changed my perspective on cold coffee. Even though I typically don't enjoy cold coffee, the Original Bird was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend giving it a try, even if you're not a fan of cold coffee!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I bought the best cookie I've ever had, ever! Salted chocolate chip. It was also a great coffee (cappuccino) and a really good price."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,The absolute best coffee in downtown SF! My favorite is the iced latte & chocolate chip cookie!!! Thank you Andytown for the best coffee and sweet treats. My new favorite spot!!!
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The cappuccino is really good, a bit on the small side, but so well made! You have to wear a mask to approach the counter, even though you dont have to wear a mask in the building. They will strictly ask you to put on your mask before ordering. They don’t seem that friendly, but the coffee is super good and the surroundings are beautiful. Perfectly place to sit and work too. Will return. The cafe itself is not open for seating 🙄🙄 , but there is seating in the general area just opposite the cafe. It can be busy, so be prepared to wait around for a desk to open to sit at."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I like this place! It’s also comfortable for work: you can find sockets here. Stuss is friendly, and coffee is nice☕️  It’s not so easy to find this place: you need to go upstairs to the salesforce Park and here you will find this coffeehouse."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I recently got many recommendations about this coffee place. People said it tastes so unique. I went to the one near Salesforce Tower. It’s actually inside of the building so you should go 7th floor and it’s connected to Salesforce Tower Park.  I ordered Snowy Plover. It tasted so weird at first. I felt like I’m drinking a cream soda. Once you get used to the taste, I bet you’re gonna like it. I think it’s worth trying at least once."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I love dropping by here, on my way to work. I usually get either an Iced Breve Latte or an Iced Breve Mocha, with extra whipped cream. I’m not worried about the extra calories, heh heh heh. They make their own whipped cream. It’s yummy!  They recently opened up their indoor seating."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The staff were so kind, and open to adjusting our order as needed. I got an oat milk latte with brown sugar syrup and it was divine. The strawberry chocolate scone was perfect- not too dry, but not too cake-like. Great place to grab a coffee before exploring the Salesforce garden!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Beautiful Decor at this lovely new building. I love the circular light fixtures, very modern and cute! The coffee shop is overpriced for the small cup they give you. I ordered a breakfast sandwich to go, but it was too crispy. They overdid it with the crunch, because it came out a little dry. The barista wasn’t too friendly, either. I’m hoping they expand the space into something bigger and add more food options in the future 🙂 Or maybe replace the coffee shop with a café..? Just food for thought 💭"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Beautiful hidden coffee shop, situated next to a rooftop park. Shop itself is beautiful and modern , looks like a nice space to sit and work / study. Had the breakfast sandwich which was one of my favorites. Eggs in the sandwich were almost a poached consistency, which I preferred over scrambled. Macchiato great as well. Baked goods looked great as well but did not try."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"After reading tons great reviews figured time to try them out. Regular 12 ounce drip coffee. Taste was mediocre with a prominent bitter after taste. Very much overrated based on all the 5 star reviews. Scale of one to 10 I would say 7 all day. Big bonus about the location is that it's connected to Salesforce Park, which is really nice in the heart of downtown. Would I buy coffee here again? No"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"What a beautiful location! It is kind of hidden- had to ask the security guard where it is.  Maybe have more signs near the elevators/escalators?  There are plenty of spacious seating inside the cafe and outside. I tried their huckleberry plover (soda float of whipped cream) and their breakfast crunch cookie. The drink was decent but for $6, I expected something more. Maybe should've tried their coffee instead. The cookie was delicious! The combo of corn flakes, marshmallow, and chocolate chips gave me a warm campfire hug on the inside even though the cafe's vibe isn't very warm. It is definitely a quiet place to 'work' if that is sort of your thing."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Very busy. Lovely coffee. Beautiful surroundings.  Love that the owners are from Belfast. I was visiting my son and daughter in law. I live in Ballymena,  County Antrim, N Ireland."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great coffee! Great place to just chill and work as well. I wish they had more latte syrups - they only had a brown sugar syrup. Haven’t had their specialties yet but heard it’s good!  Pastries are solid but they run out towards the end of the day.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee and great food, but was told by the barista that Half & Half is too thick for their steam wands on their espresso machines when I tried to order a Breve Cappuccino. I have worked with many commercial grade espresso machines and feel like they were misleading."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,It’s located on the Salesforce Park level. Great place to grab a coffee and walk in the park!  It’s located on the Northish end and if your coming from lobby of 181 Fremont there is an elevator that can bring your up right where the cafe is.  Coffee is good and they have some breakfast options though nothing vegan.  They have all of their whole bean bagged coffee for sale as well. See pictures for more details.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Wonderful location in the salesforce park if you need a quick pick me up. They’re not always on point with their cappuccino, it’s pricey, and they often run out of pastries quickly. Not open on the weekends unfortunately."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Matcha plover ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - not overly sweet - liked the carbonation
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great place with amazing coffee and lovely views. The coffee is served with beautiful crafted cups and the place is just perfect if you want to see the salesforce park (sadly closed right now). Great for a bit of mental space
Andytown Coffee Roasters,My favorite coffee shop in SFO / financial district. Like the vibe and the salesforce park close by.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Andytown — what an amazing vibe! Killer music selection, super chill baristas (they’re so nice and remember me!). I feel so productive when I work out of this coffee spot. It’s connected to Salesforce park so you can go on a walk after/before you work! Great lighting and decor is super modern. The matcha lattes here are my favorite. This is where you should go work if you need a delightful space to be productive!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Awesome place right at the Salesforce park! They added lunch options to the menu, their homemade jam is just perfect, and if you like bitter-sweet drinks, you can't miss Snowy Plover"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"A lovely, charming shop with great coffee. Tried their pumpkin spice latte a little bit out of season, and boy was it delicious! The seating is nice, great for holding a conversation or just sitting down to do work. Had to buy some merch before I left to remember the shop."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Right by the new Salesforce Transit center, this coffee shops offers a selection of coffee, tea (including matcha) and food.  We went there for lunch: their gazpacho was interesting (more of a spicy cucumber flavor) while their sandwich was underwhelming (gummy texture, chicken had bones in it).  Atmosphere: it was very chill, which is pretty rare in San Francisco around lunch time and staff is friendly."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,This place is connected to the Salesforce transit center park. Really nice space and great staff. They serve an assortment of food here as well as their signature coffee.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Good coffee & nice location!
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Modern environment with tasty coffee!
Andytown Coffee Roasters,The coffee here is amazing. We went back twice during our trip to SF. I grabbed two bags of coffee to brew at home. This morning I tried the Nicaragua as an aeropress and it was delicious! The location of this shop is great since it is attached to the Salesforce urban Park.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great coffee but really hope it opens earlier!!!  Update: place has opened earlier now hooray! One complain thou as two of my coworkers had the same issue as I did... BE AWARE: whenever you order the dripped coffee the lid tend to spill!!! Hope the place can come up with a better solution... or maybe just bring your own cup?
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Espresso, which is the most basic elements of all coffee, is burnt. Burnt badly! It is a really “Unique taste”, in a bad way."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The coffee, pastries, and breakfast sandwiches are the bomb. In fact, everything on the menu is delicious as the other reviews point out.  For my review, I'd like to highlight the exceptional world class custom service the team behind bar provides. Our team works nearby and we do at least a weekly trip to Andytown for lattes, drip coffee, and mocha's. We order the same items most of the time and everyone now has gotten to know the team. It's not just us, we see them interacting with everyone. My team and I feel a genuine connection to the team at Andytown and they make our mornings better with the hospitality they provide.  Go for the coffee, come back for the hospitality."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Andytown is from the foggy Sunset District and today is well known for their coffee and their daily baked goods.  Try their signature Snowy Plover—sparkling water with a shot of espresso, ice, and a healthy dollop of heavy cream. Their scones, soda bread, and corn bread are all worth coming back for."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great cortado at my request + an even better chocolate cookie. Great views and and general a great experience across the board.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great place for meetings as you can walk in the sales force park next door after grabbing a coffee
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"On one hand, Andytown probably serves the best coffee in soma. However, you can can only order pour over from 11:30 to 3:30, which boggles my mind. I was informed that it was too hard to keep enough staff to equip the pour over bar, so decide for yourself if that's a good enough excuse. The drop coffee is a poor substitute (and inferior to the quick cups at sight glass)."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"My Dad and I wandered into this place today and I wasn’t hopeful - I find a lot of the cool coffee places’ coffee just a but thin and sour. But my small drip black coffee was perfectly dark and balanced. But what really caught my eye were the baked goods! Again, I am picky but the salted chocolate chip was perfection - soft but crispy on the outside with the right touch of salt. My 84 year old Dad approved. I went back to get a strawberry Chocolate scone for later and that was also delicious. All of the scones looked great and I will be back to try the rest! They are baked in house and definitely a reason to check this place out."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Best coffee in all of downtown. Love their cold brew.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The ""Snowy Plover"" ($6) was excellent - like an espresso float. With a stroll around Salesforce Park, it's a nice afternoon treat, and a convenient excuse to meet up with your favorite Facebook employee."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,This coffee chain has the best whipped cream I’ve tasted.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Talk about ambiance! Love grabbing a coffee here and taking a stroll around the park.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,This is a great little cafe accessible from the Salesforce Rooftop garden. It’s great coffee and atmosphere inside. One of my favorite cafes on this rooftop garden.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great location away from the crowds and right in the Salesforce Park. Highly recommend their espresso... Served the way it should be with a sparkling water to cleanse the pallet. The chocolate chip cookie with sea salt is amazing !! If you get the cappuccino however ask for it dry otherwise it's more like a latte
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Decent coffee, nothing else. Pastries and yogurt bowl were way waaay below average.  However main  shock was with the internet, how come you are a cafe and happen to offer dail up speed internet? Took ages to load any given page, dreadful."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Right next to the Salesforce rooftop garden. Great atmosphere and good coffee.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Good coffee in interesting place. I believe coffee would be more delicious in a normal mug.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Enter at rooftop (Level 4) of the Transit Center. It's inside the connected building that has diagonals (not the Salesforce Tower). Or you can enter on street level at 181 Fremont. Really good coffee. Pour overs only available around lunch time. There's always a long line around 12:30-1pm though. Pretty easy to find seats even during the busiest times. Staff will not kick you out right at closing, which I really appreciate."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Delicious latte! The coffee shop it self has very good seating good place to do a bit of work, read a book, and have casual meetings. It was a but hard to find, but you can just ask the security people in the lobby where the elevator is."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Pastries are good with coffee but not without, staff can be a little unapprochable depending on the person and skill level varies as well. Espresso is medium roast while I prefer light. All in all, still a better option than home coffee."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Beautiful spot that looks out on the been transit center park. But, Andytown has always been a Dave if mine to visit when in the Sunset. So happy they have a place downtown now. Coffee is great, service amazing, and their baked goods are a for sure win."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"This place is as amazing as the original Andytown on Taraval, and as brilliant as the branch on Lawton. I’m better, it is air-conditioned.  What you don’t have to go out to the Sunset District to get a coffee.  The downside... it’s on the 7th floor, and the passenger elevator breaks down frequently."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"This shop is well situated on the upper deck of the Salesforce transit center. It's a great location to escape the daily grind of the city without having to go far. The seating is plentiful, too."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Such a nice space!! Good food and coffee
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is due to the restricted service hours for pourover coffee, arbitrarily placed to avoid those who expect the highest accountable brewing method for their morning fare.  Not the wisest service choice I have ever encountered, but they hardly used to exist at all in culture.  The baked goods are excellent, the service is polite and unpretentious - an astonishing thing for downtown San Francisco for the most part.  I bring my old boss to this place every couple of weeks for coffee, and without a pourover available, I am saddled with the drip method for my coffee and thus a smaller array of beans.  While everyone on Earth right now is agog over citrusy, African single origin or blend beans, it is not the only flavor of coffee on earth and a good Indonesian or Columbian bean would be a welcome alternative to citrus heights real estate prices.  The Lone Comic Defender of Creativity"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Located on the roof of the shopping center, next to the roof garden. Beautiful place!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Really nice ambiance for working, and their matcha lattes are amazing!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Loved the coffee, loved the view from the Salesforce Park even more!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great roof top experience at Salesforce garden
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! New vibe right downtown with tons of place to work and meet friends/coworkers. They also have feee WiFi (unlike the Andytown in Sunset).  Try the snowy plover - espresso, soda water & whip cream - tastes like a coffee creamsicle 😎"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Excellent 3rd-wave coffee. Location will be great for transbay bus commuters once the new terminal reopens, but a pain until then (although also doesn't open until 9)."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Amazing coffeeshop. The sweets are also amazing, they all have some twist that show the expertise of the bakers.  The space is also very modern, with greenery among numerous high rises."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Snowy plovers and cookies are really tasty!
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The place is not the easiest to find. It is on the 7th floor of the building, right next to this beautiful urban garden by the Salesforce Tower. The decaf coffee was excellent and another drink with soda and whip was excellent. My go to coffee place now when I am in the area."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee but I had the WORST most bitter iced tea of my life here. $5 iced Earl grey is to be steeped for 2 min, not boiled kids!"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,It is very tricky to find this cafe since it is inside the Facebook office building. You need to take the elevator to the 4th floor to get there. It is by the Salesforce Park.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Latte lacked creamyness, but definitely a nice spot to grab a coffee and stroll around Salesforce park"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Tasty treats, good coffee, personable, cheerful team, good place to recharge and then enjoy the park."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Great cappuccino! Lid did not close properly, so be aware."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Be warned: you must go through Salesforce Park to get here but it will be well worth the trip from street level. Their coffee is delicious!
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Cool, friendly baristas, lovely park outside. Coffees (including soda water mixes), teas, a few snacks."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Back and better than ever. Breakfast sandwich is amazing, even in the afternoon. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seats."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Loved the matcha plover -  can be made vegan without whipped cream
Andytown Coffee Roasters,I had the Mocha with Oat Milk and whip creme. It was delicious and the creme was sweet to level out the flavors!.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"The 4th in the crown @ Salesforce Towers.... Exceptional coffee lovers locale and now with the luxurious  dinning Commons and soon to open garden esplanade and expanded menu, heaven awaits your downtown escape..."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Great matcha drink. Was productive while working there on my laptop. Nice access to the park.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Amazing, best ever corn muffins, triple berry.  Beautiful up there in Salesforce Park."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Coffee is on point, there is a bit of a line though as people are discovering this gem. Perfect to grab a coffee and sit outside in the garden."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"I can’t find this place at all. I’m not sure it even exists. I went into a few buildings and asked, as well as walked along Salesforce Park."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Finally a downtown co-location... great food options they have added to this branch, both pastries and lunch sandwiches"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Love coming here!
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"Has a pretty view of the park, little tricky to find, but worth it once you get there."
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Closed.  Thanks for updating your opening hours (NOT!) and wasting my time.  NICE ONE
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Walking the Salesforce Park and drinking a Matcha Plover is heaven.
Andytown Coffee Roasters,Love Andytown!  My fav: - matcha
