Hollywood Cafe,"Good food, Burger was very good, I would add more salt and some spices, but this is me. My wife’s chicken wrap was really good, my son’s grilled cheese also. I like that they adding fruits to every food. People working there are very nice and kind.  Update 2/23/23: Went for 2nd time and I was not disappointed, food in this restaurant is really good. If you are near by, go there and have a breakfast!! You will not regret it!"
Hollywood Cafe,"This place is Divine!  We came here absolutely starving after a red eye flight. They sat our party of nine rapidly on mother's day.  The food was beyond expectations. I got the breakfast wrap and it was made with the freshest and healthiest of ingredients, and it actually tasted amazing! The oranges were to die for. We were all very satisfied.  It was a little hard sitting outside by some loud traffic, but worth the food.  Would come here again."
Hollywood Cafe,"I came on a weekday around 11AM. It wasn't too crowded with a couple of customers. I sat outside and ordered ""Audrey Hepburn"" for 20.99$. The service was excellent! Super friendly and made me feel very welcome. They got me in a good mood and made me feel very cared for. The food was delicious, very good fruit and the pancakes were fluffy. I did not get a chance to go again, but I would when I visit San Francisco again. I would definitely recommend giving this Café a try and hope, your experience will be as good as mine. I can't say anything about the inside because I didn't go in."
Hollywood Cafe,"They charge 18% mandatory “gratuity” on your bill no matter the party size; even for 2 people. Other than that the ambience is very nice, food is good (7/10) and servers are friendly.  I would suggest the owner that the customer will be happy to provide a 18% for a good service but it feels a bit odd when you slap it on us."
Hollywood Cafe,The food was very average.  But the price is very high. For three people I paid more than 80$. You pay half the price when you order a Lift Taxi to Chinatown and eat dim sum or anything there.
Hollywood Cafe,"We stayed at a hotel nearby and felt like a traditional breakfast place. When we found this place, we weren’t disappointed. We had a traditional eggs, bacon, hash brown, and toast breakfast with a couple breakfast cocktails. Nothing bad to say at all! Food was great, cocktails were delicious, and our son loved the crispy bacon. The service was also excellent and we left with a long lineup by the door (which speaks for itself) Thanks for the great meal!"
Hollywood Cafe,"The cafe was a great choice for breakfast as it was right next to our hotel. The breakfast options were plenty, the service was real quick and the staff was friendly."
Hollywood Cafe,"Totally recommended. Nice place, good vibe and for a busy place, good service. I had the chilaquiles and they were completely different from what I’m used to but they were very good I must say. I also had one of their pancakes which was also very good. I got there early and the place was already packed and there was a short line. Anyways it was just me and got placed in a very short time. By the time I left there was a longer line but based on my experience is totally worth it and they don’t take that long. Coffee was okay though. Also this restaurant is close to many things so I consider it a good option to start your day."
Hollywood Cafe,"We waited only 15 minutes. As we were 6 we had to split into 2 tables otherwise it would have taken more time as they only have one big table inside. The food was great! We ordered omelets, sandwiches, and pancakes. The coffee was great too and they served super fast."
Hollywood Cafe,"so-so. quick and easy location for folks staying near the waterfront. the food is OK, but left a little something to be desired. like most things in the area, it’s meant to cater to tourists.  i got the breakfast burrito. potatoes, scrambled eggs, and some ham rolled up in a tortilla. can’t go wrong."
Hollywood Cafe,"The food and service were exceptional. They have a lot of patrons but you would never know it by the quick service. People are attended to very well and timely, almost like an eat and go. It is a little crowded but they handled it very well by setting up a makeshift awning over the sidewalk."
Hollywood Cafe,"Straight forward breakfast food here. Tastes good and presented well. The atmosphere, food and service were all good, albeit pricey."
Hollywood Cafe,Loved the breakfast here. I had the Denver omelet with a side of fruit. Omg ! The fruit is amazing. They don’t give you a small amount. It was a good portion and so fresh. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice which was so good. My bff got the Marylyn Monroe breakfast which is fruit and French toast and she also got a latte. She said it was good. They’re extremely busy so we had to walk up to the counter and get our check. They did end up messing up on the check and I paid someone else’s check which if it wasn’t for my bff I would have paid $114 on our food which I’m like what the heck did we eat. Lol They did apologize and found the right bill. Overall experience 10 out of 10. I was curious to know how there lunch is.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food , service and atmosphere. I ordered Ube latte, Marilyn Monroe, which is one of the cafe's favorite, and my husband ordered meat lover omelette. Highly recommend this place."
Hollywood Cafe,Nice place for breakfast. There was no wait to get seated and the food was pretty good.
Hollywood Cafe,"Fantastic breakfast, this shrimp salmon benedict was every bit as good as it looks! Thank you for a great meal."
Hollywood Cafe,"A very nice place to take your breakfast or lunch, people are queing up here! I really enjoyed the eggs, fast and good service, warm heaters outside, so a nice place I should have been earlier during my stay!"
Hollywood Cafe,Great portions! Order the fruit as a side. Ripe deliciousness. EGGS BENEDICT TO PERFECTION. No frills place but if you want good food and service. This is the best in Fisherman's Wharf area.
Hollywood Cafe,"This is our go-to spot when in town to site see.  They always have a great fruit selection, and French toast and Pancakes are good.  Eggs Benedict is good.  Staff is super friendly and very attentive."
Hollywood Cafe,"The staff are extremely friendly and kind. The food quality and quantity are both excellent! I'm from Illinois, so of course the prices were shocking, but after eating at several places in San Francisco, I quickly realized that the Hollywood Cafe prices are in line with or competitive with other restaurants in its class. My family was traveling with extended family from the Netherlands. The waiter was so kind to convert a menu item to accommodate our Dutch family. They made an American version of an ""uitsmijter"", which is a sandwich made with a piece of ham and a sunny-side-up egg on toast. My group was so impressed with their food quality and attention to detail, that we went for brunch again the following day. We didn't even have to talk to anyone... they RECOGNIZED our group, and started setting up a table for 9. Wow!!! The food on the second day was every bit as yummy as the first day!! Special compliments to the fresh squeezed orange juice and the hot cocoa... Yum! Thank you so much to the welcoming wait staff!!"
Hollywood Cafe,This is a wonderful breakfast place! The service was so fast and the food was delicious! There were plenty of options and the addition of fruit to each plate including my side pancake was so refreshing! We left feeling satisfied but not weigh down/overstuffed. Highly recommend!
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent food and lots of seating choices, especially outside. Our waiter was fast, efficient and accurate (usually you can get 2 of these). Fresh squeezed orange juice and good coffee. Their fruit garnishes were extra delicious vs the tasteless perfunctory fruit you typically get at restaurants."
Hollywood Cafe,"Fantastic food, came for brunch/lunch, got breakfast food. Really good quality of food, service is quick. Nice atmosphere, clean, plenty of seating. Paid between 20-25 dollars per person"
Hollywood Cafe,"Great pancakes and french toast for some solid comfort food.  The coffee was strong, waiters were attentive and service was slick.  Nice atmosphere, good food, good value (for SF)."
Hollywood Cafe,"It was really delicious breakfast . Big portion, a lots of fruit in the plate. Friendly server. They have vegetarian option which is really tasty. But smelled a little bad inside."
Hollywood Cafe,"So freaking delicious! I am writing this as I just finished the meal!!! I had the dulce French toast - with fried banana and candied walnuts, and a side of hash-brown. Freak of nation, so delicious and so filling !!! Saved as a favorite…"
Hollywood Cafe,"The food is adequate but basic. The coffee is delicious and the servers are great. It was like going to a Denny's but with a smaller, local vibe.  My six year old said the bananas were excellent and he especially enjoyed the syrup and butter."
Hollywood Cafe,"Very friendly staff and great food. Located right near the trolley line.  The sandwiches and wraps were very good, as was the French toast.  Salad was fresh with fruit! A little pricy but worth it."
Hollywood Cafe,Combo breakfast was fantastic. Kid meals were great too.
Hollywood Cafe,Some of the best breakfast I’ve had! It was a short walk from my hotel which was convenient. I ordered a simple breakfast and a vanilla cappuccino. Kept it simple but this breakfast packed a mouthful of savory taste!
Hollywood Cafe,"I found the food to be very good and delicious. Unlike other breakfast restaurants, they have a wide variety of options that you can choose from. Fruits and vegetables are included in every meal as well. The place is clean with healthy foods. There is a lot of patience and kindness shown by the waiters. It is highly recommended that you try it out. I imagine urban living to be like having a nice breakfast, chatting with friends, and sitting by the not so busy north point road on a Saturday morning."
Hollywood Cafe,"Fruit bowls wow!!! And delicious food in general. Wish i knew about this place the first day we had breakfast would’ve came here everyday instead! Portions are very generous, got the chilaquiles not the Spanish actual type at all but they still tasted very good. Hashbrowns are nice and brown crunchy yummy, and again fruit bowls wow!! A great mixture and very fresh fruit! Space indoors is roomy and there is outdoor seating as well. Heat lamps are used inside and outside if needed and service is very kind and pretty quick for the amount of customers! Will definitely come back again. Oh and decor is very cool! Lots of pictures all over the walls very nice."
Hollywood Cafe,"Absolutely phenomenal! I really loved the breakfast here, and how they all pretty much come with fresh fruit. The best part is the fruit is not just melons, it's loaded with grapes, all kinds of berries and some banana slices. The food was all perfectly cooked too. They have a mimosa flight which is fun for a girls brunch. Also the Hollywood hash browns are amazing. There topped with bacon, mushrooms and cheese. The staff was very friendly and the food was quick too. Even if there's a line this place is definitely worth waiting for."
Hollywood Cafe,Stopped for breakfast for 3 people. Pretty expensive we thought but normal I guess for San Fran.  Receipt total 68.00+  Don’t know what the open food charge was all about. Thinking maybe because we had a water. Closed water just carrying it with us. We don’t recall drinking anything we brought in.  Steak was more like a hamburger. Hash browns cold and meh.  We had a latte spill and the waiter was very quick to respond and very attentive.  Served it’s purpose. Close to hotel.
Hollywood Cafe,Vegetable omelette was pretty tasty.  Stuff with veggies.  Loved the hash browns seriously.  Yummm.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and delicious for sure.  I loved all the colors on my plate.
Hollywood Cafe,Huge portions and delicious food! Kids had chocolate chip pancakes. We had eggs Benedict. Get there early and it’s worth it. Friendly staff! Yummy grapefruit mimosa!
Hollywood Cafe,"Wanted in a long line, but it went pretty fast. Food was really good if you can tell but the empty plates. The burrito was scrumptious!  And my hasbrowns were anything but boring. I appreciate that it has flavor without being overdone. The beverages are freshly made which is a super plus. DONT LET THE LONG LINE SCARE YOU."
Hollywood Cafe,We googled best breakfast near us and this was the most recommended.  We were not disappointed.  The menu was exciting and diverse.  The portions were extremely generous.  The service was prompt and friendly.  It was nice to sit on the side walk in the fresh air and enjoy a delicious breakfast to begin our day.  The prices reflect their pride in their food and service though we would definitely eat breakfast here again!
Hollywood Cafe,"We got there on a Sunday around 11. We had to wait in line 20+ minutes but it was worth the wait.  The service was quick and the food was great.  We ordered blueberry pancakes, buttermilk pancakes and a three egg ham and cheese omelette."
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent and efficient service. The eggs Benedict were delicious. Even with a line we were seated quickly. The outdoor tables are sheltered so it was enjoyable to dine outdoors.
Hollywood Cafe,"Amazing brunch spot for delicious yummy breakfast. Friendly staff. There’s usually a line up on weekends. Very well located. The restaurant itself is small, outdated and has sketchy washrooms but who cares when they have tasty meals!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Their pancakes are amazing. As pretty too look at as to eat. The bacon was yummy, yes I know all bacon is yummy, but theirs especially. The Eggs Benny in the other hand was just good. I found it to be a bit bland. I still devoured it, but I had higher hopes! Good dinner style coffee too."
Hollywood Cafe,"We got the hash burrito and the 2 egg breakfast with bacon with the upgraded hash browns (Hollywood style). The hash browns are absolutely to die for! Everything else was amazing, so don't get me wrong, but we were fighting over the hash browns. :)"
Hollywood Cafe,"After six plus years, we accidentally ended up here for breakfast. This is a fantastic little street side cafe with an extensive yet simple menu."
Hollywood Cafe,Very nice. Come early. Even in the early morning there’s waiting.
Hollywood Cafe,Very good breakfast here. Good portions and quick service. This was definitely a good choice.
Hollywood Cafe,"We had nothing to complain about, the food was perfect!"
Hollywood Cafe,"The place came highly recommended as a breakfast place. I must say, this is not the most elegant place I have ever been to- as matter a fact, disappointingly simple- the food makes up for it. Large and tasty portions, and while you do have to wait a little bit, everything seems to be fluid once you order. The Staff is interesting. They are not overly attentive, as they are on some places, bit they are always there if you need them and also helpful and friendly when engaging ina brief conversation. There is a satisfying secrecy in knowing that all those people who are passing by have no idea how delicious the food is, because of how the place looks. The restroom is also a shared public one.  Not ideal for a date 😄  however of you want good food I definitely and highy recommend it 👌"
Hollywood Cafe,"I have dietary restrictions. The staff took my order accurately, and my food came out just the way way I asked for it. The Hollywood Hashbrowns are really good. The fresh fruit bowl here is much nicer than the one served across the street."
Hollywood Cafe,I freaking amazing here and the service is one of the best. I strongly recommend trying them out whenever you have a chance. The food is that amazing here and their prices are pretty great too.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great diner food selection! The eggs Benedict were on point, just as the sauce! The little fruit pieces were nice as a mini desert :) Waiters were ninjas that kept my coffee cup filled at all times :’)"
Hollywood Cafe,"Great option for a late breakfast/ brunch. Pancakes, omelettes and wraps are all delicious. Veggie omelette is filled with onions, mushrooms, arugula and peppers - very tasty. Regular pancakes comes with fruits, the Audrey Hepburn combo is essentially the same (much more fruits) but $5 more so if you don’t want a large fruit bowl, regular pancakes are as good. Hash browns are a different take - thinner and crispier - but delicious nevertheless. For something unique try the Hollywood Hash! Definitely worth a visit."
Hollywood Cafe,Very good place for breakfast! Service was fast and professional in a clean comfortable atmosphere! We had eggs Benedict and pancakes and sat on the patio and it was a great experience!
Hollywood Cafe,"There's a reason this place is so popular! Friendly, quick service turns around the line and keeps tables moving. Fruit bowl is a specialty and not just berries and bananas! There was watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, grapefruit... You get the picture. Hearty, meaty meal options for the carnivore and healthy, fresh options for others. We had the Rancheros with fresh guacamole and the Marilyn Monroe French toast with fruit. Both delicious!  We ate here and around the corner at Eight AM and preferred Hollywood Cafe for the better menu, but both were amazing and recommend you go to both like we did. Don't let the line deter you as, again, it moves quickly and you can read the menu in line so you know what you want when you get seated. There are so many choices! I wish we had tried the sweet bacon. Next time..."
Hollywood Cafe,"Trying new places is always scary, especially when you have preferences or stick to your usual. But this place has had by far the BEST eggs Benedict EVER! The English muffin wasn't soggy and I finished everything on my plate. Thank you Hollywood cafe for your delicious food and tasty lemonade! Will be back for another bite!"
Hollywood Cafe,"There was a line up to get in but we didn’t wait too long as we requested to sit outside. The host wanted to make all 5 of us to sit around one table. We argued and he eventually let us take 2 tables. The portions are huge. Share if you’re not too hungry. Burritos are great. Again, they’re huge!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Super small place, decent food, but very crowded, and you feel like you're eating with the table mates next to you as if they are sitting at your table."
Hollywood Cafe,"super tasty breakfast with excellent service, your coffee is always topped up! needless to say we ate here a few times. it's not the cheapest but were are on holiday!  closes after lunch!"
Hollywood Cafe,"This place was awesome. Great breakfast with super generous portions. Their two egg breakfast scramble was easily three eggs. Hash browns are great, crispy the way I like them. Their staff was also very friendly and helpful!!!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Exceeded my expectations! A good lesson for me in ""not judging a book by its cover"". At first glance the outside dining ambiance was unimpressive and the menu was limited and pricey, but once the plates came, wow! The serving sizes were generous, the plating was so pretty, and everything tasted amazing. I had the avocado toast w/scrambled eggs (soo pretty). I can't wait to try the shrimp eggs benedict tomorrow and maybe even a mimosa with the fresh squeezed OJ everyone raves about. 😊"
Hollywood Cafe,"Food is good. Fresh orange Juice. I'm not used with the way things go in america  but a tip was claim and ""gratuity 18%"" of the bill was already included in the price."
Hollywood Cafe,One of the Best Mushroom/bacon burgers I have ever had. Large portions great food. Not fancy on the outside but don't judge it from that.
Hollywood Cafe,Service was great when we went on a weekday. The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was great. Spoilt for choice for the brunch variety. Definitely will come back here to try out the lunch and dinner. Absolutely love their Hollywood hashbrown
Hollywood Cafe,"Love their hash brown, perfectly golden and crisp outside and soft inside. The crab eggs Benedict and French toasts taste good too. Service is okay and the staff is friendly.  The missing star is the restroom. It’s not in the restaurant but you have to walk out the resto and find another entrance (and don’t forget to ask the waiter for the access code). It’s not really the problem. The problem is that the restroom is pretty messy or I’d give 5 stars."
Hollywood Cafe,This place is overrated. Did not live up to the hype. You will be very disappointed if you come here. The quality of the food was subpar. Pancakes were not fluffy and the omelette was bland. Please find somewhere else to go.
Hollywood Cafe,"This is very rare and most people love our food. There are many items that you can try and we are so sorry that you were not happy with us. Our staffs are working really hard to make sure you are happy dining in with us. Hopefully, you will give us another chance and our staffs can go through the menu with you."
Hollywood Cafe,"Thick chewy tasty pancakes, loved it!"
Hollywood Cafe,"good food, very fast to serve. fries are real, fresh. service isn't fast, you have to call for them for anything including bill."
Hollywood Cafe,We got the Hawaii burger and the berry salad with grilled chicken. They serve both breakfast and lunch and they close at 2pm. Get there in the morning early to avoid the long lines. We both ordered grapefruit juice and it was perfect not being too sweet or sour. This place is across the street from our hotel the Hyatt at fisherman's wharf.
Hollywood Cafe,I don't know what to say but since we came here restaurant are fast with cooking food I haven't wait a long time to get my food since I eat around San Francisco. This place is amazing with breakfast stop by check out this restaurant. I'm from Seattle WA and San Francisco is doing a great job with fast cooking amazing 😍. Good breakfast people work here are amazing doing a great job serving!!
Hollywood Cafe,"Came in early and the place is already filling up at 730am! Ordered their crab omelette, and based on the portion I got salad instead of the regular hash brown. Such a good choice! The portion was outstanding and I really enjoyed my omelette. The crab meat, though not super fresh, was fresh enough for me as to not having that annoying strong seafood taste which usually stemmed up when the seafood was set long. The avocado goes well with it, and the whole thing was lightly salted. The overall taste was very balanced and the ingredients great. My friend ordered eggs and bacon sandwich and he enjoyed it. The only complaints was that they gave too much fruits haha! The side toast was ok, goes well with the omelette. Service was good and fast. The staff was friendly. A very good experience overall."
Hollywood Cafe,Best breakfast we had in San Francisco Definitely the place to go for a perfect breakfast and start your day strong :) Thanks
Hollywood Cafe,"the food isn’t extraordinary by any means and the service wasn’t the best. don’t get the orange juice. the french toast was pretty decent. overall, it’s a decent place to get breakfast if you’re sightseeing and don’t care to get a fancy breakfast or stop at a fast food place."
Hollywood Cafe,Had the eggs beni. Mine was ok but the hashbrowns were funky. My wife's had a big hair on her eggs which were returned and refunded. They were busy and the service was soso hence I would have to think twice in giving another try with so many breakfast options in the area.
Hollywood Cafe,"We walked right in and got a seat but lines do form outside. It’s a cozy place but you do have elbow room. The food is okay - the omelet is made weird, meet on bottom and egg set on top. My beacon egg and cheese was gooood!  They did have issues making eggs. I’d come back, but they’re expensive!!!"
Hollywood Cafe,"We went here for breakfast, as it came highly recommended, and were pleasantly surprised by a short wait for a table. The quality of food here is exceptional. You can't go wrong with any of the eggs Benedict -- I personally tried the classic, turkey, and salmon while visiting San Francisco on a weekend trip. The banana chocolate Pancakes, and doche French toast are also very sweet, a.k.a. the dessert of breakfast. You can go for a flight of mimosas if you feel like it, or a refillable coffee. This breakfast spot is conveniently located next to fisherman's wharf, where there is plenty to do, so it's a great place to start your day if you're exploring SF. Otherwise, it's just an awesome place for breakfast food. Finally, the staff here is very warm, friendly, and efficient. Thanks for your time! 😄"
Hollywood Cafe,"Hi, Evan. It's wonderful to hear you enjoyed your meal and service with us. Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience and sharing with us! We look forward to your next visit when you are in the SF area again."
Hollywood Cafe,Very good place for breakfast. Delicious meal and courteous staff. Expect a wait but the staff are super efficient.
Hollywood Cafe,Such delicious food. The fruit bowl was amazing. Very fast service. Would definitely recommend
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place to get some breakfast. There was a little bit of a line but it moved fast- I think we ended up only waiting 10-15 minutes. Had the eggs Benedict, blueberry pancakes, and washed it all down with some bloody Mary's. It's worth giving it a visit."
Hollywood Cafe,"Amazing food. Bacon, fruit, and crab Benedict were best I’ve had. The mimosa flight is awesome. Really impressed by the quality here"
Hollywood Cafe,One of the best breakfast places everything is always nice and hot and arrive is very fast .
Hollywood Cafe,"What a breakfast 😋 set us up for most of the day. So much choice on the menu. We sat outside did have a look indoors not that much "" Hollywood"" as such. Excellent and efficient service 👍"
Hollywood Cafe,Great breakfast and brunch. Waiting line can look scary but moves fast. Good service.
Hollywood Cafe,"It was really nice Sunday breakfast, there was a queue but we sat in a short time. Servers were very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious. I had better service and food than i expected. Thank you!"
Hollywood Cafe,Hands down best breakfast I've had. Absolutely amazing! Great service!
Hollywood Cafe,"Fast service, and the mushroom gravy was amazing."
Hollywood Cafe,"My family and I ate here every morning while being in San Francisco. Very good breakfast, especially the French Toast and Pancakes. Definitely would recommend."
Hollywood Cafe,"Best breakfast in San Francisco near Hotel Zoe.  We went there twice.  Everything is delicious, but I especially enjoyed the classic benedict."
Hollywood Cafe,"Good Morning SFO, fresh orange juice and freshly brewed coffee. Lots of breakfast options,you can custom with pancakes or waffles whatever you like, staff is very helpful and friendly. Ranchero tacos are great,with few eggs and sourdough bread with fresh house-made butter."
Hollywood Cafe,I got the dolce French toast with no powdered sugar. It was delish. Quaint breakfast nook near fisherman's wharf.
Hollywood Cafe,Waited in a short little line once they opened...come hungry...the Ranchero was a fabulous lightened version...yummy fresh fruit
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place for a scrumptious breakfast.  The fresh fruit makes every plate standout.  Busy and a bit pricey, but worth it!"
Hollywood Cafe,Thank you so very much for your kind words and we are very happy to hear that you enjoyed dining in with us.
Hollywood Cafe,"A tiny little brunch spot with yummy food ! I had their fresh orange juice and tried a two-egg dish called Rancheros which came with a side of toasts and hashbrown. Loved the food and the vibe of the place!! Only down side of this cafe is it closes pretty early and has a long wait on most days, so make sure you come on time and have time up your sleeves."
Hollywood Cafe,"Busiest place I've seen, waited outside 10 min before opening at 7am and 10 people showed up to get a seat. My eggs benedict were delicious special ordered with avocado and tomato. However, chilaquiles sold at this place are NOT authentic chilaquiles: totopos on the side of scrambled eggs with the cold salsa on top is not what I expected. The bread and coffee's good."
Hollywood Cafe,Outstanding... !!!! Our First time there .. We had our Daughter's Birthday Breakfast there before going to the Pier and The Aquarium... Excellent Food .. Big Portions.. Great Service... Thank you so much guys ... CHEERS and SEMPER FIDELIS.....!!!!!
Hollywood Cafe,"Visiting my daughter at college and our first choice for breakfast was unexpectedly under renovation. Found this nice little place on phone search. Only had to wait 10mins in line. Service was great, pleasant and food came out quickly after we ordered. We both had French toast, eggs and sausage. They added some good tasting fruit (bananas, strawberries, blackberries and orange slices) on the side. Everything was good! Pricey like most things in SF."
Hollywood Cafe,The food was amazing and well presented. We went during the week and there was about a 10 min wait. We were seated outside but the weather was perfect and we were wearing sweaters.
Hollywood Cafe,Nice well served breakfast
Hollywood Cafe,"The Hollywood Cafe was a great stop on our adventure around San Francisco.  My wife and I had no idea how busy the place was going to be and when we arrived the line was outside on the curb.  The wait was only a few minutes despite the long line and after ordering, our breakfast was out in minutes.  The BAT Scrambled Eggs and Morning Wrap were a good way to start the day.  With a longer line by the time we were finishing our food and the wait staff's overly attentiveness we did feel a bit rushed, but that did not sour the overall experience.  I would definitely recommend the Hollywood Cafe, especially if you plan to continue your morning at Fisherman's Wharf."
Hollywood Cafe,"I had the egg breakfast with bacon. While this on its own was pretty good, I went a little extra to get my hash browns ""Hollywood"" style. That was phenomenal. If you eat here, I highly recommend doing that. This place had a slight waiting line outside before being seated. Don't let that discourage you. It moves fast, and is proof that they do a tasty breakfast."
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent food and service. Very quick and all the food was delicious.
Hollywood Cafe,Wow one of the highest rated places for breakfast and it's under rated! Great service and food was special. Just check out the pics of the steak and eggs and the crab Benedict. Nice presentation that was totally unexpected. Can't wait to go back.
Hollywood Cafe,"Fantastic service. Can accommodate for vegan/vegetarian options. The food here is great! For seafood lovers, would recommend crab Benedict."
Hollywood Cafe,One of the best breakfast diners in SF..pancakes are amazing
Hollywood Cafe,Pancakes were as expected- fluffy and delicious. They have seating both inside and outside. There is no waitlist and you wait in line to be seated. We showed up on the later side of breakfast around 11:30 am and maybe only waited 15 minutes to be seated.
Hollywood Cafe,Vibrant atmosphere with excellent customer service.
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious and generous breakfast!!. Kind and attentive staff.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food and decent serving size. Not cheap, but then nothing in SF is. Service was quick and efficient. Hash burrito was awesome."
Hollywood Cafe,"Cute little diner in the tourist area. We had no wait for seating, delicious food, well cooked. There is a movie theme going on, if that's not obvious from the name."
Hollywood Cafe,Third time here. Everything has been delicious. Could eat the sour dough toast all day. My wife and I always stop here whenever we are in San Francisco.
Hollywood Cafe,Great food !! Wish they opened earlier and stayed opened later . We would have ate there breakfast lunch and dinner !! Fast service as well
Hollywood Cafe,The food was really great! Everything tasted awesome. The kitchen was open to see which was really cool! Service was okay. You basically have to ask for ice even just for water. All in all a pretty great little place.
Hollywood Cafe,"Best breakfast ever!! The food was so fresh and delicious!! Great customer service. We had the crab Benedict and the crab omelet. The coffee was tasty, and their fesh fruit was so fresh and sweet. Love, love, love this place!!"
Hollywood Cafe,Breakfast was delicious. Service was quick. Will definitely return.
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent food and service loved it.. they have a great selection for breakfast.. fresh fruit.
Hollywood Cafe,"Hands down the best hashbrowns I've ever eaten! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The omelette was also the perfect ""fluffyness."" The staff were great and didn't mind making something not on the menu to accommodate my food allergies."
Hollywood Cafe,"Way Over price, Not that great, server was NOT friendly at ALL,    Daren’s Cafe around the corner or Boudin.   Is WAY Better choices."
Hollywood Cafe,The breakfast was absolutely great. Nicely located near the tourist attractions but far enough not to be crowded.
Hollywood Cafe,The food is very nice but definitely not worth the long queue. No different from any other American breakfast
Hollywood Cafe,"Absolutely fantastic!! Not only was the service friendly and prompt, the food itself was beautiful and yummy.  I’m glad we chose to stop here for breakfast!"
Hollywood Cafe,Food was pretty good service was not to bad I just wouldn't ask for a coffee from here again. Gratitude was automatically charged for a party of 5 18%
Hollywood Cafe,The best breakfast in San Francisco the food was excellent an the staff the same 10/10 every morning simply THE BEST
Hollywood Cafe,"A great albeit expensive breakfast place in a prime location.  We waited for about 20 minutes and line for table moved quickly.  Service was brisk but friendly.  Fresh OJ and coffee were excellent along with my benedict and girls pancakes.  Meal was expensive, but you are in a tourist location so I'm not sure what people expect.  What they can be fairly sure of is a great meal and service."
Hollywood Cafe,"True to its name there are photos of old time Hollywood stars on the walls. We went for breakfast. The pancakes looked pretty but, they were a bit rubbery. The fruit was nice and fresh. I also had a side order of bacon. Can't go wrong with bacon."
Hollywood Cafe,Food is good but they close 90mins before what google maps show so plan accordingly
Hollywood Cafe,"Friendly staff, great food! The fresh fruit was a real treat. The bacon was perfect.  Pancakes were large, the scramble was filling and the omelet was filled with plenty."
Hollywood Cafe,Amazing breakfast.Great customer service. Beautiful sunny day to eat outside.
Hollywood Cafe,Breakfast sandwich can feed 2. We ate here twice and split both days. Very attentive waitstaff on coffee refills. Outside seating in “COVID-19 cover” built on street.
Hollywood Cafe,"Worth the wait. Terrific breakfast items- not ""wow"" or ""unique"" but simple food, made well, with nice portions and speedy service. Their ""Sweet Bacon"" - steeped in orange juice, maple syrup, and a few secret ingredients is a must have, unless you prefer crisp bacon ONLY. Coffee was a nice blend, served very hot. Everything was priced well. Not a value, but what in S.F. is??? Go and enjoy."
Hollywood Cafe,"Pretty good little cafe  Decently Priced, Good Food, Good Service  The banana chocolate chip pancakes are good"
Hollywood Cafe,"Words escape me, partially because I’m in a state of slumber after the size of that breakfast but mostly because it was awesome! Hash burrito containing what must have been a 10-egg omelette, ham, cheese, hash browns, avocado, fresh tomato salsa - wow. Delicious refillable filter coffee, orange juice and attentive service.  Nothing but 5* from all of us. This is a must do for anybody wanting to experience an American breakfast."
Hollywood Cafe,I ordered salmon scramble egg with house coffee and the taste was amazing! Especially the hash browns they serve are so crispy! Definitely visit again!
Hollywood Cafe,Small place inside but food was a perfect presentation and delicious! I will go back when in town.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place. Delicious food served hot and scratch kitchen style , prompt service.  Perfect for lunch, brunch or Lunch!!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Delicious and attractive food, attentive service and reasonable prices for brunch or lunch. 6 kinds of eggs Benedict! Amazing huge hash browns!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Wow this is a fantastic breakfast venue, so generous with their servings. Fresh pilled on food with wonderful selections. The ‘hash browns’ are enormous - they literally cover a whole plate.  We were recommended by the concierge at our hotel and we couldn’t believe our luck. This place is popular and it’s easy to see why.  The value for money and freshness of food is “top noch” - best value I’ve found. Service is friendly and fast.  Do yourself a favour and try this place when your down near Fishermans Wharf in San Francisco, I’m sure you’ll be pleased."
Hollywood Cafe,"I came across this place while heading to the Fisherman's Wharf in SF. I Googled them and saw they had excellent reviews so I went for breakfast. I'm glad I did. The food was excellent, good, attentive staff. Not much more I could ask for. I went early so I was seated quickly, but they definitely get busy with a line, so be prepared to wait. I will definitely return on my next trip to SF."
Hollywood Cafe,"This place is sneaky good. It's a small place that's located a block off of the main tourist area. The food is very good, with healthy portions and is one of the more reasonably priced places in the area. The service was great, food was quick and an overall great experience."
Hollywood Cafe,"Good food, good service. Would visit again."
Hollywood Cafe,Not sure to understand why this is a famous place for having breakfast. It was fine but nothing you can't find anywhere else.
Hollywood Cafe,"Amazing place for breakfast. Convenient location in Fisherman’s wharf. We went there for 5 consecutive days and breakfast and service was always excellent. Whether it’s the fruit bowl, French toast, eggs Benedict or omelette out 3 teenage boys where always happy! Not cheap but very generous portions."
Hollywood Cafe,"Small place, good service, I've had better french toast, but food in general was good."
Hollywood Cafe,Very very good address. One of the best breakfast that i have eaten. We find there lot of choice with a large portion. Very good ambiance. I love it !!
Hollywood Cafe,Great service with generous portions. Cost was actually a little cheaper than most in the area. Wait time for seating was less than 10 min. Best breakfast I had all week.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great breakfast, very friendly staff 🤗"
Hollywood Cafe,I really loved this little place. I went there every day I visited in San Fran. Lovely and delicious.
Hollywood Cafe,Enjoyed breakfast here. Crab omelette was superb and a pleasant surprise considering I’m not the biggest fan of crab.
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious breakfast!! You have to queue a bita for a table but it worths.... When you are almost finish the waiters bring you the bill informing you that you can pay when you are ready.... they are pushing you to fisnish your breakfast in a very nice way as they have people quequing outside.....
Hollywood Cafe,"Good food, kind of pricey. If you get the chilaquiles, don't expect to get what you would get at a Mexican restaurant. The chorizo is served as a sausage and the chips are placed on the side (tostitos) 🤷🏻‍♀️ …"
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious breakfast and the best assorted fruit bowl with our meal.  Fast service.  Seating inside or out.  Open kitchen.
Hollywood Cafe,Food was good but they charged 18% tip without asking!
Hollywood Cafe,Breakfast was exceptional My wife and I would recommend this place for Breakfast! It is definitely 4.5 star restaurant  The servers are excellent and quick
Hollywood Cafe,The place is all about food and feeding you as you like it...  Super service!!!!!?
Hollywood Cafe,Great brunch/breakfast selections. Very good Dungeness Egg Benedicts!
Hollywood Cafe,One of best place to have breakfast in SFO near pier41.
Hollywood Cafe,"I really like that they are very generous with their portions, and that the price is actually very affordable for what I'm given! Friendly servers and great recommendations too!"
Hollywood Cafe,Pretty good food but I felt it was a bit over priced.
Hollywood Cafe,"Short wait for great food. Very fun menu with some amazing choices in breakfast. I wanted to order a little but if everything! I ended up getting the Smoked Salmon Benedict, and it was amazing!"
Hollywood Cafe,The breakfast here is Amazing!
Hollywood Cafe,A nice place for breakfast and brunch. The menu was good and the staff was super polite and helpful.
Hollywood Cafe,"Very tasty! Recommend the Dulce French toast. Inexpensive for the area, but if you don't go early, they have a line out the door."
Hollywood Cafe,Amazing as always! Pro tip: get here right at opening to ensure you don't have to wait in line. The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. I recommend the mimosa flight and pancakes.
Hollywood Cafe,Food was delicious and the service was great. A little cramped but overall fantastic
Hollywood Cafe,I had the Vivian at Hollywood and omg. The size of this croissant was huge but so good. It was worth every penny!
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent breakfast. Tried turkey benedict. Nice refill coffee too. expect 30 mins queue.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great menu of brunch/breakfast selections - Healthy Plate, Denver omelette, and iced coffee were all excellent. The outdoor seating with tables well-spaced apart and shaded made for a relaxed experience."
Hollywood Cafe,"We had a delicious eggs Benedict this morning, service was fast and amazing!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Foods really good, just make sure you have time to wait. It's about a 30-40mins wait even if you're the 2nd table that sat down since they opened"
Hollywood Cafe,"Food portions were generous but my Chilaquiles were lukewarm and lacked flavor.  Eggs were hidden at the bottom with chips at the top and some type of ""spicy"" which was not spicy sauce.  Decor was a few pics of old time celebs-not really a good representation of Hollywood. Too pricey."
Hollywood Cafe,Great spot for brunch!
Hollywood Cafe,Solid eats. We ordered food to go and it was piping hot. I had the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and it was absolutely indulgent.
Hollywood Cafe,Nothing fancy but a great little spot for breakfast. I’ve been here four times and the food/ service never disappoints.
Hollywood Cafe,Best blueberry pancakes I’ve ever had and look at that fruit salad on the side. It was expensive but totally worth it. I think it was like a $17 breakfast but I guess SF is just expensive. Very busy. Was lucky to get a table. Great service
Hollywood Cafe,"Had the eggs Benedict with Dungeness crab. Was pretty amazing; a ton of chunky crab meat, eggs cooked perfectly. Side of crispy bacon and sourdough bread was worth it too! Only things I'd change is to get the hollandaise on the side (didn't add much, in my opinion) and ask for crispier hashbrown."
Hollywood Cafe,"The line for breakfast was 30 min, we order lots of food, I order the Huevos Rancheros and I was impress by this plate! Everything was so good! I’ll return to eat to this place! Service was extremely good!"
Hollywood Cafe,Got the breakfast wrap. It was so good but too much for just 1 person. The french toast my friend got looked delicious as well.
Hollywood Cafe,"Surprised to see any negative reviews: queues for a reason, well cooked and presented food with some interesting quirks (the misagaru legume latte with high fibre multigrain soy and honey: healthy and tasty)"
Hollywood Cafe,"Complete SF tourist trap, but a charming one. The food really is quite good (especially for an area where most of the places catering to tourists are overwhelmingly mediocre), but it's definitely priced for clueless vacation spenders.  There's almost always a line of tourists out the door, but the staff is friendly. The decor is dated and needs an update, but it's ""historic"".  I'd go here more often if they had North Beach prices instead of Pier 39 prices, but there are far better deals within a 10-minute walk."
Hollywood Cafe,"Awesome! Amazing! Get there early, lines form quickly! They make every attempt to get you seated asap, but it gets busy.... because it's GOOD!!"
Hollywood Cafe,Top spot for breakfast. Found this through other good reviews online. Food was fantastic.
Hollywood Cafe,Big portions and delicious! Hollywood hash browns are the go. Go wary of you don't like to wait - We got there just after 7am and already a small wait - by 7.45 there was a queue! Worth it though
Hollywood Cafe,"Finished my food too quickly to get a photo, but it was instagram worthy. French toast and eggs benedict were top notch and the service was great"
Hollywood Cafe,"A simple place but breakfast was very good, nice service."
Hollywood Cafe,Very delicious breakfast.  Wait time wasnt too bad during a busy weekend day.  Service was fast and friendly.  Hearty servings.  A good place to go.
Hollywood Cafe,Very good breakfast!! Huuge and delicious hashbrown!! Get there early or you'll have to wait in line!!
Hollywood Cafe,Best breakfast I've ever had! I come every time I'm in the area.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great Food, near the wharf area, only open til 2."
Hollywood Cafe,Fantastic breakfast but better be there early as it is hard to get a table otherwise. There is a reason why people queue to get in as the food is delicious!
Hollywood Cafe,Very busy restaurant  worth the wait.grat food and friendly staff.
Hollywood Cafe,"The food was incredibly good, especially the eggs! Took a star off for the price, though. It's very steep for the amount of food you get (which is enough for a meal, but for $23 a person I'd expect to be getting some leftovers out of it).  Good for a one time visit while here in SF, but not a ""breakfast every day of vacation"" place imo."
Hollywood Cafe,Omg the best eggs benny iv had. Hands down. Great service too thank you!!!!
Hollywood Cafe,You must eat here! Get there early although the wait was short for a relatively large line around 9:30am. Food was great!
Hollywood Cafe,Was sceptical about place since terrace is very bad built but food and staff where excellent.
Hollywood Cafe,"The best breakfast in fishermans wharf yet.Great range of variants on the menu, well prepared and good size plates.good service and well priced"
Hollywood Cafe,Best breakfast food I've had. The crab omelette was so good. The french toast was very flavorful. The orange juice is freshly squeezed. The fruit is fresh. Plating and presentation was so pretty. The price isn't high for the portions and quality you get. There was a line and all tables were full and we still got seated and served in less than 30 minutes. I've had to wait longer than that just to get seated in places that come nowhere near as good. You can tell they put thought and effort in everything they make. I recommend this place to everyone.
Hollywood Cafe,"My favorite breakfast joint in San Francisco. Expect to wait for 20-30 minutes on a weekend morning but the wait is worth it. This place is open only for breakfast and lunch, so plan accordingly."
Hollywood Cafe,"We came here after looking at the positive Google reviews … and we weren’t disappointed. The food was brilliant, very generous portions and the staff are lovely. We would definitely come back!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent spot for a nice breakfast.  I tried the vegetarian omelet.  Let me add that I am not vegetarian so this was a new idea to have an omelet that did not have bacon and sausage.  But, I gave it a try and have zero regrets, it was delicious!  Highly recommended."
Hollywood Cafe,Very good quick service restaurant. Very accommodating.
Hollywood Cafe,"The food was excellent and well presented. The staff was friendly and attentive.  As many other restaurants in San Francisco, this place has added additional outdoor seating to accommodate visitors that do not have proof of vaccination.  Our table was technically on a parking space in the street in front of the cafe but because of the temporary patio roof and partial wall, combined with the outdoor space heaters made the dining experience very enjoyable."
Hollywood Cafe,Goooood and fresh! As you can see my plate is empty and I needed to take half of my sandwich with me because the portions are big:) The service is very nice 🙌🏼 …
Hollywood Cafe,Was goo normal breakfast place. The portions are big
Hollywood Cafe,Very friendly staff and they have kept the outdoor sitting area very clean. I tried to orange juice and a hash brown with two eggs sunny side up and it was delicious. Even though there was a long line we got a seat waiting 20 minutes. It was fast.
Hollywood Cafe,The Hollywood Café is a very nice breakfast restaurants you can eat all day every day very good food we had in two weeks vacation like every second day our breakfast or brunch there when you are not early you have to wait a very long time out at the front door because it's a very busy business
Hollywood Cafe,Arrive early as the queue is long enough if you arrive late. the breakfast is good and fast serving.
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent place for breakfast!  We got there early and there was a line to get seated but it moved very quickly!  The service was great and the food was delicious!
Hollywood Cafe,Perfect start to a busy day !!
Hollywood Cafe,"Service could have been a little bit quicker but, wow!  Really delicious!"
Hollywood Cafe,"My husband had the Crab Eggs Benedict andI had a veggie omelette. Both were excellent. There is no choice for breakfast potatoes. You get hash browns, which are clearly not homemade as they were shaped in a perfect rectangle. They tasted like fast food hash browns. Also, I asked for corn tortillas instead of toast, because I can't eat wheat. First the waitress said there would be an extra charge, but we explained that toast is more expensive that corn tortillas. Then she wound up bringing me a flour tortilla!  I did not bother asking her to fix it, as she did not come back to check on us. There were people who refilled our coffee often. It was just mediocre coffee. So this place is a mixed bag, for sure."
Hollywood Cafe,Crab omelette was awesome but portion was quite big for both of us. They do serve pieces of breads before your mains.
Hollywood Cafe,Always so good and never disappoints. My wife and I always visit here when we travel to SF.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food, friendly staff and definitely worth a visit. Get there early to avoid the queue."
Hollywood Cafe,Wonderful food and service. Had the Crab Eggs Benedict.  Only suggestion I have is opening earlier during Dreamforce. Would have loved to eat here more often!
Hollywood Cafe,"Truly lives up to all the positive reviews. Great drinks, food and service. We arrived around 11:30 AM on a Sunday and didn't have to wait for long at all."
Hollywood Cafe,All of us got food poisoning!!! Look at your receipt for that additional percentage added. Not recommend.
Hollywood Cafe,"Good food, nice atmosphere. Prices are in line with the rest of San Francisco, which is to say not cheap. Lots of locals were eating here so clearly they know what they're doing."
Hollywood Cafe,Pretty cool place. Cozy and nice staff. The portions were good as well. Very enjoyable experience and would go again for the delicious food.
Hollywood Cafe,Amazing place great food! Just watch out for the burrito it doesn't like to stay in burrito form.
Hollywood Cafe,"The breakfast was excellent, and service was on point. Restrooms were not cleaned properly however. Overall a good experience."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great little place for breakfast with nice, quick service."
Hollywood Cafe,"I recently stayed at the Marriot a block away from this little gem while I was in S.F. for work. I must say that this restaurant is every bit as good as the best breakfast restaurants in Portland, Oregon where I am from and maybe even a little better! The lady that took my order was very kind and personable and double checked to make sure she had my order correct which she did! I think it was literally 6 minutes from ordering that I received my food with a smile and a thank you, this place gives excellent service to say the very least! When I opened my to go box after walking the block back to my room I was pleasantly surprised with the hottest, freshest, tastiest breakfast I think I've ever had! The fruit was very fresh and good and chilled as it should be in its own little foil pouch. The scrambled eggs were hot and steamy cooked  to perfection! The ham steak was nice and thick and cooked perfectly as well but the French toast was AMAZING! Seriously some of the best French toast I've ever had! I highly recommend the Hollywood Cafe, you simply will not be disappointed!👍"
Hollywood Cafe,Great food  and quick service. Breakfast burrito is tasty. The chicken lunch burrito is quite good too.  Lines can form - especially for Saturday breakfast.
Hollywood Cafe,Great diner.  Portion was reasonable for a tourist area
Hollywood Cafe,Very very tasty breakfast. It may get busy if you reach past 8am.
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious American food combined with warm hospitality from friendly servers. People were literally standing in a queue for a bite.
Hollywood Cafe,"Food and service is good, but the restrooms are really gross. If it is any indicator of the cleanliness of the kitchen, I don't want to come back... can't give 5 stars if they skip cleaning  I understand sometimes people are gross but they were out of hand towels in both toilets, and soap in women's toilet. Some doors didn't close. Lack of general maintenance."
Hollywood Cafe,This place is a must for anyone visiting SF for the first time. Waiting time in the queue was around 30 minutes.
Hollywood Cafe,Audrey Hepburn. Pancakes and fresh fruit. Always a winner combo.
Hollywood Cafe,Such a fantastic breakfast. I ordered eggs Benedict with shrimp..avocado .. Asparagus...and it came with wonderful crunch hashbrowns. Service was great. They were busy but they were very friendly. I highly recommend
Hollywood Cafe,"Great American breakfast, get there early to avoid the wait. Nice staff."
Hollywood Cafe,Got seated fast enough.  I ordered the dungeon Egg Benedict which was great.  Love their hasbrown.
Hollywood Cafe,Nice quick breakfast diner. Quite crowded with high churn...great if you want a quick turnaround...not a match if you're looking for a relaxed breakfast.
Hollywood Cafe,"Nice cafe, very good and American food nothing special in flavour. The service was great."
Hollywood Cafe,Fun array of mimosas! Plus we enjoyed the breakfast food. Came here while wandering the wharf area. Friendly staff!
Hollywood Cafe,One of the best breakfast places I have ever been. LOOK AT ALL THAT FRUIT! Highly recommend!
Hollywood Cafe,"Big portions! Friendly service. Get a fruit bowl, best we ever had! Omelets were also great as was the french toast.  Pancakes were 'meh', but still good. Overall would go again."
Hollywood Cafe,The server was a little shy but did everything single thing right. No mistakes in the food. The veggie quesadilla the was so delicious and was the best thing that we ordered. All the other order were either satisfactory or more. I would stop by if I’m in the area.
Hollywood Cafe,Above average breakfast food. The staff was top notch. Friendly and responsive.
Hollywood Cafe,"So so, not the greatest taste experience and a bit pricey"
Hollywood Cafe,Nice location and nice customer service here. I love the breakfast with refreshing fruits!
Hollywood Cafe,"I had the dungeness eggs Benedict and absolutely loved it! So yummy! My husband had the chiliquilles and wasn't as enthused. It's not traditional Mexican style; they put the chips on the side, rather than being part of the dish. He did say that the chorizo had good flavor. The service was quick and friendly, and the decor was cute."
Hollywood Cafe,The service was great and friendly. Food and coffee were just okay though.
Hollywood Cafe,"Fast and pleasant service, food was great!"
Hollywood Cafe,Wonderful place with wonderful food. Must go!
Hollywood Cafe,"Service was fast & friendly, the restaurant is clean & pleasant. I ordered the breakfast wrap - the ingredients were fresh and interesting, but it was totally bland! (Hence the 2-star review.) If the eggs and other wrap ingredients had been properly seasoned, this easily would have been a 4- or 5-star review. Hey cooks - season your ingredients properly!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Arrived on Sunday morning around 8:30am and got the last inside table. When we left around 9:00am, there was a line of about a dozen outside.  The place is efficient and the quality of food is high. Menus were on the table when we got there and service was prompt and friendly. There’s a nice kids menu along with a variety of food with many healthy substitutions available. Egg whites, mixed green salad instead of hash browns, and a few others. Most of our plates also had a few large strawberries and about half a banana.  Great place for breakfast, especially as an escape from hotel restaurants. Just get there early or be prepared to wait on a weekend."
Hollywood Cafe,What a great size plate. You will definitely get your monies worth. The staff is awesome and friendly. Food was delicious and I highly recommend the Hollywood hash browns........To die for!!!
Hollywood Cafe,Thank you so much and we are so happy to hear that.
Hollywood Cafe,"Get there early! They fill up quickly, but it's because the food is so good! Had a great breakfast. I got the eggs, ham steak, and hashbrowns."
Hollywood Cafe,Way over priced. Food was just alright nothing WOW.
Hollywood Cafe,"Needed to do takeout and the items were presented just like they would have been in the restaurant. Excellent attention to detail! The food was great! Had the vegetable omelette which the eggs are folded over fresh cut vegetables and shredded hash browns. The flavors were spot on! The blueberry pancakes were tasty and had fresh blueberries, bananas, and strawberries on the side. Also they are open early!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Hollywood Cafe is a cute little diner with great food. However, there were so many gnats flying around we had to move to another table. Although the food was decent (nothing more or less special than any other breakfast spot), the prices were a bit high. $76 for breakfast for 3 (1 adult and 2 kids)."
Hollywood Cafe,Thank you so much and We will make sure to solve that problem. Please come see us again when you are in the area!
Hollywood Cafe,"I went here for breakfast and there was a line. We waited about 30 minutes to get inside and the servers were very efficient.  I would have to say it might be the best run breakfast restaurant I have ever been to. The food was great, the theme was also well chosen, great presentation with the fruits and all the workers were so efficient we didn't notice how packed it was.  We got plates off the ""favorites"" menu and everything was very good. The hash browns were really good. Everything perfect."
Hollywood Cafe,Fantastic French Toast combo! A must try! Fabulous customer service!
Hollywood Cafe,"This place is so good we came back the next day!  The food is absolutely delicious, fresh fruit, good coffee, the best friendly and fast service we could have asked for.  Everyone is so nice and it's perfectly clear that service is their #1 priority besides the fantastic food.  I can't say enough about how we enjoyed eating here.  Yesterday we ate outside and were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the street was.  If you're in San Fran, stop by and get a meal before you head over to Fisherman's Wharf!"
Hollywood Cafe,Great spot to grab breakfast. Staff is friendly and attentive. Be sure to try the scrambled egg chilaquiles.
Hollywood Cafe,Breakfast here was good! The food was great and service quick. You do have to queue but the line moves quickly.
Hollywood Cafe,What a gem. Best breakfast we have found in the Fisherman's Wharf area. We have been going there for 6 days and will do so until we leave San Francisco in another week. Staff friendly & food amazing.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great cozy little place for breakfast... Love the B. A. T. (Bacon, avocado, tomato with scrambled eggs)  and the orange marmalade, too! Everything was prepared fresh to each order. Service was quick and friendly. Be sure to get there early and you won't have to wait in line. This place is worth the wait even if the line is outside on the sidewalk. We did have a good breakfast at other local eateries  but this was definitely our ""hands-down"" favorite!"
Hollywood Cafe,"I ordered a burger, which may have not been the best choice at a brunch place. Regardless, when it came out it looked fantastic but did not taste as good as it looked. Lacked in flavor but not bad. Good spot if you are staying nearby"
Hollywood Cafe,"One of my favorite local spots for breakfast/brunch in the city.   The staff is very friendly, accommodating and attentive.   The food is excellent and is always quick to the table."
Hollywood Cafe,Thank you so much and we love to have you here always.
Hollywood Cafe,Had breakfast everyday when staying across the road at the Hyatt Centric. Food is plentiful and well prepared. I enjoyed it all. The staff are friendly and competent. The good is served reasonably quickly. This place does get very busy with a queue outside at breakfast and lunch time. I chose to go as soon as it opened then there was no waiting. If your don't like being up early it clears up for brunch.
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious food and fast service. Would most definitely come again.
Hollywood Cafe,Really good breakfast food and in a great location.
Hollywood Cafe,"We waited and got seated and I told the server of my allergies. He recommended not getting the hash browns and offered to sub out for sliced tomatoes or mixed greens as a side instead.  I got the vegetable omelette because I was not sure if the .eat was gluten free. I was afraid of cross contamination, but I did not have any issues and the food was very good The fruit bowl is a $3.99 up charge that you could also get as a side. It did look very good with quit a bit of fresh fruit."
Hollywood Cafe,Once was not enough!  While visiting San Francisco we stumbled upon this amazing place not far from our hotel near Fisherman's Wharf!  Portions were amazing as was the taste!  We loved our breakfast so much we came back a 2nd day!  Service with a smile as well. Don't miss their fantastic coffee!
Hollywood Cafe,Amazing breakfast!  Get there early or there will be a long wait!
Hollywood Cafe,"Understand COVID and the restrictions and how it has impacted business, we felt rushed, food was under cooked,  and had no flavor. Would not recommend and felt very tourist trap like. Breakfast was over $60 and we would have eaten better at McDonald's."
Hollywood Cafe,"Food and service are good but not extra. I had the blueberry pancakes which were light and fluffy, but they are smaller and you only get 2. The bacon was really bad, hard and not tasty at all. The fresh fruit was a nice touch. If you're in the area it's fine but I wouldn't make a special trip."
Hollywood Cafe,"I consider this place a bit of a greasy spoon. The portions are large and the food I had was very greasy. I had the hash browns with scrambled egg whites, chicken apple sausage and a croissant.   I couldn't finish my food because it was too much and not so delicious. Avoid the chicken sausage, it wasn't good.  The speed of the service was excellent."
Hollywood Cafe,Give me the banana vanilla sauce recipe plz
Hollywood Cafe,"Oddly shaped, nice restaurant with good food and friendly service. The indoor decor is themed and fun and the outdoor seating is covered and faces the street. It was a little too windy to sit in the shade so check the weather if you're hoping to sit outdoors. The food was great but a tad overpriced for what you get. One waiter made a small, snark and the bathroom was very dirty, but otherwise it was quite nice. I recommend stopping by here for a bite."
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious breakfast in the heart of San Francisco. Every time I’m visiting SF I have breakfast here.
Hollywood Cafe,"Literally the best French toast I have ever had in my life. It haunts me to this very day. If you're in San Fran and you NEED French toast, don't go anywhere else, it won't be as good as this French toast. Trust me."
Hollywood Cafe,"My son and family visited this spot on vacation. So when they surprised me with 3 days in San Francisco. We went to Hollywood Cafe yesterday for breakfast. EXCELLENT! From waiting in a line of about 20 and being seated in about 10 minutes. To the efficiency of wait staff, servers  and runners. Service was swift but not rushed. Food was delicious I had eggs and sausage with a Hollywood hash browns. A fresh hash brown covered with mushrooms tomatoes bacon and cheese. Yum! Also had a bitter Mimosa and my son a soju Bloody Mary. Both drinks we made and served beautifully. He enjoyed A special called the Vivian Leigh. A large egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant and today he chose morning breakfast wrap as well with the Hollywood café hashbrowns that were so delicious. If I ever get to San Francisco I will not have breakfast anywhere else. Don’t ever let the line are you from waiting they are well well oiled machine Coffee was strong and plentiful. It was so enjoyable we returned again this morning before returning to LA. Today. Again ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Don’t let the line intimidate you it moves very quickly and worth it."
Hollywood Cafe,Thank you so much for your kind words. And we are glad and happy to hear you enjoyed dining in with us. We can't wait and always welcome you whenever you are in town. Have a safe trip home and see you again soon.
Hollywood Cafe,"If you go on a weekend be prepared to wait approx 30mins in a line. They have EXCELLENT food and service. You must show proof of vaccination to eat indoors, but there is outdoor seating of you're not. Masks ARE required. Would love to go back!"
Hollywood Cafe,"We had a party of two in the rain so we walked up and were seated immediately. Even so, while waiting for food the line to be seated moved quickly. A very homey, classic breakfast place with great choices and fresh food. Eggs Benedict are yummy!"
Hollywood Cafe,The Audrey Hepburn breakfast is outstanding!   Delicious pancakes coupled with very fresh fruit.   A real winner!
Hollywood Cafe,The hash browns and egg benedict were very delicious!😋 …
Hollywood Cafe,"Good, but overpriced breakfast.  No complaints since we prioritized convenience over cost."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great options - had breakfast here but could see that the lunch options served out also looked amazing (soup & salad). The fruit bowl on the side was a happy surprise - the quality and volume was impressive! Highly recommend as the wait time was much shorter than other places we tried. Also despite his busy it was, I got a number of offers to have my coffee topped up - exceeding expectations!"
Hollywood Cafe,"One of the few places we went to more than once during our stay.   Great breakfast,  great service!"
Hollywood Cafe,"We arrived at the good moment (09:30) because it seems that this restaurant can be quite busy. The staff was friendly, each person weird in their own way...(but at the end it’s almost cute). Vintage Hollywood decoration was nice, the food was served in big proportions and the coffee was on free refill. Big up for the delicious hash browns."
Hollywood Cafe,"a bit overpriced, but good. not friendly for my gluten free friends"
Hollywood Cafe,We were staying at the Hyatt across the street and our first morning noticed the long line at the café so we were curious enough to go there the second morning. We didn't have to wait long because it was later in the morning. The food was fabulous and the servers were nice. I didn't get the fruit bowl but I saw someone else get it and was SO much fresh fruit - unbelievable! Our omelets were hugs and very tasty! Their coffee is great too. Overall I know why they have such a big line every morning! Wonderful place!
Hollywood Cafe,The wait for your turn at this place is worth it. The coffee and the breakfast option are just too delicious.
Hollywood Cafe,This was our first stop of the day after flying in from out of town.  Service was quick and the food was good. Highly recommend the fruit bowl!
Hollywood Cafe,"Wraps are great, good food, basic setting."
Hollywood Cafe,"Insanely amazing breakfast. I cannot brag about this place enough. Fantastic, friendly service. The Salmon & Shrimp Eggs Benedict has some quality ingredients that you wouldn’t normally find. And their fruit bowl also has some very unconventional (albeit amazing) fruit... to go along with the typical fruit there is kiwi, blackberries, raspberries, grapefruit, I mean, really good watermelon in December. Yes, I just typed that much for a fruit bowl!"
Hollywood Cafe,The food was so good.  The service was also spot on.  You never needed to get anyone’s attention.  Coffee was constantly  refilled as was the water.  The presentation of the food was photo worthy!!  Loved it and would definitely recommend!!
Hollywood Cafe,"Thank you for the kind words, Wendy. We appreciate you letting us know how much you enjoyed your meals! We look forward to serving you again."
Hollywood Cafe,Great breakfast with plenty of choices.
Hollywood Cafe,Good choice of staples for breakfast. Food was tasty but some overpricing in my opinion. They wanted 11 bucks to add a side fruit bowl to my meal.
Hollywood Cafe,"So I was torn on whether to give this place three or four stars, I would have rather given it 3.5 if there was that option.  I've decided to go with three stars for a couple of reasons, I'll start with the good stuff.  PROS: - Food portions are large and delicious! - Their fruit platters are amazing. - Had their omelette and Hollywood hash browns, delicious! - Wait generally isn't too long if you're a party of four or smaller. - Quick service, I mean really quick.  CONS: - No real clear direction for newcomers on getting seated, you just walk in and try to find a waiter or put your name on a waiting list. - Tables are very small, we had a group of four and there was no room to place anything on the table after we received our meals. - For a group of five or more, expect to wait upwards of 30 minutes around 10am, and make sure the entire group is there or they will skip you. - Feels like you're rushed all the time for them to move on to the next customer. - The real reason I gave it three stars, the giant hair that was sticking out of my omelette.  Overall, this is a good place and I would love to give it four stars, but the hair in my food really killed it for me.  I would go back, much better option than the restaurant across the street from it as well."
Hollywood Cafe,Crab benidict was pretty good.
Hollywood Cafe,Fantastic brunch.  Worth waiting outside in the cold for!
Hollywood Cafe,"A great breakfast diner that I unfortunately only found on the last day of my trip. The Blueberry Pancakes were perfect and the hashbrowns were a good portion for the price. Stop in and check it out, but get there early - the place filled up quick."
Hollywood Cafe,"I ordered the cheesteak burrito and was not disappointed. It was delicious and a very large portion. I was a little underwhelmed by the pancakes I received. I was hoping the order would be larger. Overall quick service and good food. The waiter we had was very nice, too."
Hollywood Cafe,The food is wonderful! The service is wonderful! The prices were a little shocking considering I am from a small town in Missouri. My Mom and I shared a combo and it was the perfect amount of food.
Hollywood Cafe,"Food looks great and portions are big. BUT it's overpriced and lacks flavor. I ordered french toast and it literally was just a soggy bread dipped in egg...there was no vanilla, cinnamon or any other flavor to it. It was not crunchy nor caramelized! 13 dollars for 3 half slices of bread and a bit of fruit is overpriced to say the least... My partner ordered crab eggs Benedict. It lacked salt and hollandaise was tasteless.  Maybe we were unlucky, but from my experience this place seems like an over-hyped cafe with ridiculous prices when compared to the quality of the food."
Hollywood Cafe,"Alright I got the chilaquiles , and that wasn’t good the hot sauce was sour they made my food into a dip sauce as in the tortillas were on the side and the egg inside wasn’t that good the chorizo was meh. Don’t get the chilaquiles  get pancakes or something else."
Hollywood Cafe,"Awesome breakfast selections, large servings as well. Queues may be long but they move along pretty quickly.  Hands down one of the best breakfast options in San Francisco. Eggs Benedict with Dungeness crabs are great, do try the sweet bacon as well!"
Hollywood Cafe,Summer say it's a tourist trap but the chilequiles and sweet bacon were wonderful!
Hollywood Cafe,"I was a little sceptical when I arrived as the place seemed like an average diner. It was fairly crowded, which was encouraging, and I managed to get a seat outside.  Service was fast and efficient, and my coffee was refilled very quickly. I ordered the combo pancakes with ham steaks, and I was surprised by the size of the dish, complete with a large selection of fresh fruit. It was an excellent meal that I struggled to finish and which left me full for most of the day."
Hollywood Cafe,"Hands down best customer service we received from any establishment in the Bay Area, honestly maybe in all of California. Portion size are awesome, food was prepared fast and prices were reasonable. Everything tasted great!!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent little cafe near many attractions. Just a couple of blocks from many sights and shops, it's a perfect breakfast and lunch spot to get your day started or for a mid day break for a bite to refuel. I wish I had gotten some photos of our food, because it was truly fantastic looking and tasted great. More impressive when considering how quickly they were able to prepare and plate. Excellent portions, especially for the price. It is a very busy cafe, so if you don't mind the noise of the city, I would sit outside. We didn't have to wait for an outside table, but it would have been a few minutes for a table inside. The service was on point. Fast and friendly service and they had one staff member just freshening up coffees. Even brought brand new cups full of coffee and took the old ones when a fresh pot finished it's brew. I can't say enough about Hollywood Cafe. They are top notch. I look forward to eating hear again the next time I'm in San Francisco."
Hollywood Cafe,"Although they only seat parties that have everyone present, their service is otherwise great. The wait staff check in every so often and are quick to attend to requests.I ordered the crab meat omelette ($17.99) and it was delicious. It came with a side of hashbrowns, which were crispy and to die for and two slices of oranges. I ordered this dish expecting imitation crab meat, but was delightfully surprised with a heaping serving of Alaskan crab meat and avocado."
Hollywood Cafe,Cool place to have a very American breakfast!
Hollywood Cafe,"Food without doubt delicious even the quantity is sufficient to fill one's apetite but at the end bringing bill to the table is so unexpected, is kind of pushy making one leave and not let enjoy/feel the ambience around ;) having said this its a must visit place for brunch when in SF. go for it guys"
Hollywood Cafe,"I was wanting to try something new and thought I may enjoy some sunny outdoor seating and breakfast. I was excited to see that they had several tables open when I walked up and stood behind the couple in the line queue (thinking we couldn't be waiting long as there were 3 open tables set and ready to go!). I was horribly wrong. Myself and the couple who was there before me stood there for several minutes and was passed countless times by servers. I smiled, made eye contact, and was not once acknowledged. Nobody even had the courtesy to say ""hello"" or ""we will be right with you"". The atmosphere was not very nice at all, and I had plenty of time to watch lackluster plates being served to those who had been seated. After more than five minutes (I kept track on my watch) of being blatantly ignored by servers clad in hideous yellow shirts, I left. As a local, I will not be recommending this cafe to anyone. As a person in the service industry, I am disappointed with the way I was dismissed as not even being worthy of a greeting when servers passed me several times, saw me waiting for several minutes and had nothing to say to me, but plenty of time to talk to each other...... There are plenty of great restaurants here in North beach, where you will be treated well. Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage fire."
Hollywood Cafe,"15 min wait despite a long line, but definitely worth it. Great breakfast, especially the crab omelette and the breakfast wrap. My daughter loves the chocolate chip pancakes. Very friendly staff."
Hollywood Cafe,"The Best breakfast joint near Fisherman's Wharf. Just be advised there would be a minimum 15-20 min wait time depending on the crowd size, But the wait is worth.  All the items on the menu was very good and filling. Pankcakes, French Toast and even Omelet is served is fresh fruits which is really good.  The best part is the hash brown that you get, crisp and evenly. Even the jam kept on the table seem to be fresh and not a packaged one. Over all a very good place, just make sure that you start a 20 mins early just in case there is wait."
Hollywood Cafe,"Really good food, prompt and polite staff."
Hollywood Cafe,Great brunch close to Fisherman's Wharf
Hollywood Cafe,Its ok nothing special.
Hollywood Cafe,"We hunted around for a sit down breakfast, and after several misses came across the Hollywood cafe. We started with amazing coffee, and ordered the avocado bacon and tomato scramble with Hollywood hashbrowns which is topped with grilled mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. So delicious! The eggs were amazing. And they fresh squeeze the orange juice. The service was great. If I could give 10 stars I would. When in San Francisco,  we will definitely eat here again."
Hollywood Cafe,Yum!  The food is delicious.  The outdoor seating is nice but you'll be eating in front of people because there's usually a line.  I'm the staff isn't extremely friendly but they are attentive.  Still going with five stars because the food is phenomenal for breakfast.
Hollywood Cafe,This was our favourite breakfast spot for my wife and I. There was always a short line up but it moved fast and the service was excellent. This is a cute place with old pictures of iconic actors and actresses inside and there are a number of tables outside for a street cafe feel. This is a must for breakfast when in San Fran and I bet you go more than once!
Hollywood Cafe,The food was served hot and quickly.
Hollywood Cafe,Food and service was great. Only thing I can say is the portions are to small for the price you pay.
Hollywood Cafe,"Fantastic breakfast!  The hashbrowns were done so well, both my friend and I thought they were the best we've had.  The omelette was very tasty and kept me full while wandering around Fisherman's Wharf during the morning and afternoon."
Hollywood Cafe,Breakfast was fresh and very tasty. Fast service. Outdoor seating is great on a beautiful day!
Hollywood Cafe,"As someone whose favorite meal is breakfast, I can say this is absolutely - hands down - one of the most delicious breakfast places I've ever been to. It's nestled in the heart of San Francisco's tourist mecca, Fisherman's Wharf - DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU! The eggs are fluffy and cooked to perfection, each plate blanketed with a heaping portion of hash browns, and the bacon extra crispy and thick cut. I've never tasted fruit more fresh and sweet. The french toast is spectacular, as well! LOVE coming here on the weekends, but expect to wait 30 minutes or (MUCH) more if you arrive during peak times. Shortly after opening or near closing seems to be the best time to go. HIGHLY recommend!"
Hollywood Cafe,Tasty and really good portions. It is a really good option. Service is fast and friendly staff.
Hollywood Cafe,"Honestly, it was just OK. My food was disappointing, and while the Gregory Peck advertised itself as homemade ground sirloin, it tasted more like a hamburger patty than sirloin."
Hollywood Cafe,Hollywood cafe was an alright restaurant. The service was semi decent although the food was pretty good. Everything was very pricy and hardly anything on the kids meal. Would not recommend if looking for a cheap place to eat.
Hollywood Cafe,This place has the best Dolce French Toast for breakfast!!! Very fast service and great food. I definitely would recommend it to anyone. I’ve been here 3 times on my vacation to San Francisco and have yet to be disappointed.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place for breakfast or brunch. Big servings so you don't have to worry about leaving hungry. Nice staff and don't be put off if there's a line outside, the wait is usually short and worth it. Pancakes are great!"
Hollywood Cafe,Good breakfast/brunch food. A nice place to sit with friends and have mimosas on the weekend or a quick bite. It's a nice diner about 10 minutes walk from the piers.
Hollywood Cafe,Very Good. Fresh ingredients in the Denver Omelette. Sourdough toast was great. Place looks a little dumpy from the outside but don’t let that stop you. Reasonable pricing as well.
Hollywood Cafe,"If you've woken up hungry this is the place to go. I was there last week. Despite the bad weather we still had to add our name to the wait list before we could get a table. It was so busy even though it was 8 am! We ordered a fruit salad, pancakes, coffee, tea and chocolate. Great service, overwhelmingly big breakfast, cheap prices. Be sure to plan in some waiting time if you think you might be in a hurry."
Hollywood Cafe,This place was recommended by my friends and I was surprised to see long queue even at 7.30am. it took 15-20 minutes to get a table. Service was quick and I really enjoyed the breakfast. Quantity is huge so check your hunger level before ordering.
Hollywood Cafe,Comfort issues is the only reason I give this place a 4 star review everything else was perfection. Staff super friendly
Hollywood Cafe,"Great breakfast Cafe in San Francisco.  The restaurant itself is old, a bit run down and very crowded, but you would expect this for a real, old fashion breakfast joint.  But the food is awesome!!! Which is real reason you would go anyway.  I highly recommend it!  The best party is the OJ, it's real squeezed.  Enjoy"
Hollywood Cafe,I came across this cafe when I was looking for breakfast before a city bus tour. I saw a long line to get into this cafe the day before and it made me curious how good they were. I got there once they opened. I didn't have to wait to get in. I had San Francisco omelet. It was great. The door was wide open and it was windy (as expected). One thing that you would need to know it that there is no bathroom available at this cafe. Staffs were very nice.
Hollywood Cafe,"Diner for breakfast and lunch.  Food is two stars, service is 4 stars.  Lots of tourists here thanks to the close hotels and Fisherman Wharf. This is basically a private version of IHOP or Denny's.  Very good service but food is prepared to appeal to children, lots of sugary toppings on most things and even when ordered plain things are still very sweet.   If you want dessert instead of breakfast it's probably a good place for you.  Did enjoy the fresh fruit they offer as a side or bowl and the coffee was above average for a diner.   Fairly expensive for breakfast but the service is well staffed and friendly.   Better food close by unless you have kids with you want to make happy."
Hollywood Cafe,Very good customer service and good food. It is a bit pricey but it’s ok!
Hollywood Cafe,"Quick service, courteous staff, many choices, delicious, fast meals to our table. If there's a line, its worth the wait, cute Hollywood decor"
Hollywood Cafe,"Nice place , crowded on Saturday but we got seated right away which is more than I can say for other brunch places where the wait time exceeded 45 minutes. The food was ordinary but the coffee was good. The place is decorated with old  hollywood images and the 80s soundtrack contributed to the vintage vibe."
Hollywood Cafe,"The food here is fresh, hot and delicious! The service is top notch. I will visit here every time I'm in town!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning at 715 and got the last inside table. Since it was crowded it did take awhile for food but to be expected. Food tasted great, hash burrito was awesome and the kids pancake meal was huge."
Hollywood Cafe,😋Breakfast was delicious and nice presentation. Portions are big. Fast service. Staff is nice and friendly. Recommended 💯Definitely will come back 🙂. ( Restrooms are screaming for makeover) …
Hollywood Cafe,"If you want to start your day right, you need to order your breakfast at Hollywood Cafe. The prices are not cheap, however you can expect a big portion of food. I can definitely recommend the pancakes. Those were absolutely fluffy and on point. Every order comes with a littly bit of food decoration."
Hollywood Cafe,"We found this eatery on Google Maps and the reviews gave us the green light. The food was very, very good and the service was in the same vein. I'm glad we check with Google Maps. Just all in all, a very nice experience."
Hollywood Cafe,"I thought their food was good.  It certainly wasn't bad, and the service is really friendly.  The only thing I didn't like was that the chips that came with the chilaquiles.  It looked like it came out of a bag.  I prefer homemade tortilla chips instead of corn.  My sister got the eggs florentine and she loved them.  My dad enjoyed his lox too.  The restaurant is located in Fisherman's Wharf, so it can get pretty crowded with tourists staying in nearby hotels.  My sister and I sat outside and enjoyed the food and sun."
Hollywood Cafe,30 minute wait - line goes out the door. They gave us a menu to look at so we were ready to order when we sat down. Food was delicious and it was a much better place to eat than the tourist traps on the pier. Highly recommend.
Hollywood Cafe,"Probably one of the best place in San Francisco to get breakfast! Be aware that there may be a line but it's worth the wait.  I ordered the Chilaquiles, which I honestly don't remember the contents, but I remember  that it's one of the best breakfast entrees I ever had.  My experience in Hollywood Cafe was positive. The customer service here was also superb and continually asked my friends and I if we ever needed anything."
Hollywood Cafe,"The place is very lovely, and the food is exquisite. It's a must-try when you're in SF."
Hollywood Cafe,"Had the orangish French toast and the scrambled eggs and cheese sandwich (I was hungry!) and both were very good, although not quite worthy of five stars.  The French toast was really drenched in egg batter (which I love), but didn't have much of an orange flavor.  It was served with yogurt, which I thought was a bit strange, but ended up being really yummy (with the French toast).  The sandwich was good - plenty of eggs and cheese, but wasn't anything really special.  Very prompt service as well.  A little on the pricey side - $24 for the meal with coffee and orange juice."
Hollywood Cafe,"Well worth the wait!!! A small quaint breakfast nook with food that makes your taste buds explode with delight!!! Don't pass up the Hollywood hashbrowns they are a meal themselves. Large portions, great coffee and quick service! I highly recommend."
Hollywood Cafe,"The food here is super yummy. It is a long wait,I waited about 20nminutes but it was totally worth the wait. I had a crab eggs Benedict which was so good. I love the food. The service is really fast and friendly. We sat outside at one of the little tables along the sidewalk."
Hollywood Cafe,Great food and great service. I enjoyed it here and I think the price was worth it. Defiantly go here if you want some good food and service.
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent place to eat if you like large portions and enjoy heaping sides of fruit. Get there before it opens or risk waiting in long lines as this cafe is often overflowing with customers. Often you can feed two with the amount of food you get here, but it's tempting to order separately just to get more of a taste for the food. Be sure to try the sweet bacon and get a cup of hot chocolate if you're seated outside."
Hollywood Cafe,Tried this place while on vacation and ended up going back 2 more times for breakfast. Food is fresh and of the best quality ive had at any breakfast place. Staff is very friendly and attentive. I don't see how you couldn't be happy. Great place.
Hollywood Cafe,Rude employees. We were new in the area. Walked into the cafe and the lady an employee yelled at us to get out and wait outside. We stepped outside then another employee walked up to us and asked us to wait further down the sidewalk. We were so confused didn't understand why we had to wait so far away they had no signs up stating this. They need training on customer service. I can't rate the food. We left and took our business around the corner.
Hollywood Cafe,"You bypassed the sign to please wait to the left and entered the building without proof of vaccination, which goes against the mandatory San Francisco Health Order in restaurants before entering.  The line was formed there to wait for staff to ask if you would like to eat inside (verify proof of vacation) OR to eat outside (no proof of vacation necessary) before entering.  The line is designed with social distancing in mind and to form against the front side of the building—away from the front door and patio.  Furthermore, you were asked to please wait outside for assistance.  To eat indoors, you must show proof of vaccination, regardless.  It’s an unfortunate misunderstanding it appears and we do our best to accommodate and understand all situations. If you asked for qualification, the staff would have been more than happy to explain the process to you since you were unfamiliar."
Hollywood Cafe,"Very good breakfast place that opens at 7am. Portions are large (with fresh fruits), had the ""Marilyn Monroe"" two days in a row and really enjoyed it. When we left around 8am, there was a line waiting to get a table."
Hollywood Cafe,We expected a long line on a Saturday morning at 9am based on the reviews but we got seated quickly. Breakfast burrito and French toast were both excellent and everyone is right...the freshly squeezed OJ is excellent!
Hollywood Cafe,"The food was excellent but it took a very long time to come out. It may have been an issue for just that day, perhaps they were short in the kitchen. I didn't ask."
Hollywood Cafe,"Thank you, Angela for your visit and feedback. We are so sorry that the food took too long to come out. Hopefully you will join us again and try more items from the menu we are sure you will love as much as most of our customers do. And yes we were short of staffs on that day."
Hollywood Cafe,"Easily the best French toast breakfast I’ve ever had. On the higher price side, but well worth it. Service was impeccable as well."
Hollywood Cafe,Food was fresh and tasty! I have thought about their bread and jam for days now! Avocado toast was tasty...I would ask them to toast the bread a little more next time though. Fruit bowl is fantastic!
Hollywood Cafe,"Really great spot!  Huge piles of fruit with most meals.  We were able to take that to go and have plenty for tomorrow.  Their food was great!  Not my number 1 spot in the city but, a really great spot!  I love their old Hollywood theme and it definitely had a wait so come early!  When a place has a wait I don't mind waiting cuz I know it's gonna be amazing!  It was a relatively easy place to find parking and we waited about 30 mins to get breakfast.  It's a little chilly if you sit outside but, other than that everything is pretty great!"
Hollywood Cafe,"This place is about service and presentation. I stayed across the street and visited the place based on a review. The food was great, cooked to perfection. Presentation was impeccable and the service was around me every five minutes to check if I’m ok. My cup of coffee was filled all the time (I can drink 4 cups for breakfast). They offer takeout, which is perfect if you stay in a nearby hotel. They open earlier than the others and this is an extra advantage."
Hollywood Cafe,"The wait wasn't long and food portions were a nice size. Over all the food taste was terrible. I had pancakes, eggs and bacon while my husband had the breakfest wrap. The eggs were under done and the pancakes were over done. I could barely cut through them. Very disappointed."
Hollywood Cafe,This place should stick to what they are good at which is crepes. Our group ordered crepes and Garlic fries to share they were absolutely swimming in oil and undercooked. So much so it was nauseating to eat more than one bite. Service was sub par as well as the person at the register was very rude and impatient. Reminds me of Katz’s Deli in New York with all the rudeness and none of the quality.
Hollywood Cafe,"Wonderful experience!! Fast service and the food was hot and made with love. Thank you for making this experience wonderful!!  My husband and I will def be back when we visit again., A couple from Cleveland, Ohio. 😊😊 …"
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food, great service"
Hollywood Cafe,"A pleasant experience - the food was excellent (I have never tried the combination of garlic and honey on my fries, but it works :D!) and the service was good. However the place was a little crowded and I did not enjoy the movie-themed inside of the place, because of that."
Hollywood Cafe,"Food passable, barely.  Service is wanting.  Service charges add significant amount to bill.  If you can walk a little farther to almost anywhere will find a better place for breakfast"
Hollywood Cafe,"This was our second resort since another place was way too long of a line. My wife wanted breakfast and it was already 1PM due to wasting time wondering if we should wait it out at the other place. We ventured in to ""HOLLYWOOD CAFE"" already thinking this was going to be ""whatever"" because it wasn't our first choice.  Well I was silenced because our first experience here proved us wrong. Being so close to the wharf--one of the major tourist spots in SF, we were expecting high prices, small portions, and average quality. We were surprised to see portions were plentiful, prices were very competitive, and the food was great!  I wasn't feeling breakfast so I ordered the California Burger. MAN IT WAS SO GOOD! Especially at the price. It was $11-12. It was a good size burger. I'm a fat boy and I was satisfied at half of the burger, so finishing up the rest--I was done! It comes with fries, but not boring fries-- but CURLY FRIES!! SUPER DUPER POINTS! The ingredients were all fresh tasting and the bun tasted almost croissant like. It had a hefty amount of avocado and SPROUTS! It was just great!  My wife's breakfast was good too. Bacon was on point. French Toast was good.  Key thing with this place is they do not SKIMP out on things. Each dish comes with loads of fruit!! Not the usual few pieces you would expect, but a good portion. I've seen other tables who ordered an actual side of fruit and it was shocking to see how much they give.  This placed surprised me, mainly because we were so bummed we couldn't go to our first choice restaurant and we had the mentality that anything else wouldn't compare. But we were wrong, and I'm glad we came. Although this is right by one of the biggest tourist area's in SF, the quality and value were excellent. You normally expect overpriced and average food in tourist areas, but this place was neither.  Hopefully things don't change. I would definitely go back.  PS, the service was great btw. Only hiccup was our original waitress who took our order messed up. 2 in our party said we wanted a side of FRENCH TOAST, but they gave us FRENCH FRIES (which are curly fries btw-no complaints its awesome) . So we thought that was the side of fries for the 2 burgers that we ordered, but it wasn't. The manager said we can keep it which was nice. But our waitress gave us the cold shoulder the rest of our time there. To the point she didn't wait on us anymore. Mistakes happen, she didn't apologize, nor were we mad about it, but had to point that out. It was her mistake though, she probably wrote it wrong and got confused, as she asked us when we ordered the burgers if we wanted salad or french fries. It happens, no big deal."
Hollywood Cafe,Great food...And the BEST service. They were super busy but very impressed with their friendly and efficiently service. The owner should be proud. They work really hard.
Hollywood Cafe,The Hollywood Cafe is terrific. Our meal was more than we expected. Food was well made and delicious for a reasonable price. Staff were also quick and attentive.
Hollywood Cafe,"Thank you so much for your kind words, Albert. We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us. It is great to hear you liked our food and service! Please stop in again soon."
Hollywood Cafe,Extremely not impressed. This place is super busy and I cannot figure out why right now. I ordered a Denver omelette and this omelette was the farthest thing from an omelette. This was more like a bland egg pocket. All they did was cook three eggs and placed and BUNCH of HARD/ UNCOOKED ONIONS AND BELL-PEPPERS with cheese and served it to me. I could barely chew the bell-peppers. Obviously quantity is more important than quality here. I hate paying for okay at best kind of food! See the pictures of my bell peppers and onion omelette
Hollywood Cafe,"Very helpful staff. The food is excellent. An excellent replacement for hotel restaurants, especially breakfast. You can eat outside for those looking for a Covid19 friendly alternative."
Hollywood Cafe,Easy and quick spot for breakfast. Big space so you will certainly get seated each time.
Hollywood Cafe,had breakfast here every day of our trip.... great food... cant go wrong... bonus... mimmosa... cheers
Hollywood Cafe,"Brunch with family twice because of location But, food and service were great! Busy location with enthusiastic staff."
Hollywood Cafe,Great Breakfast!  Wish we had got the breakfast wrap because it looked great from what we could see a other tables.  No complaints and would go back!   Great coffee too!
Hollywood Cafe,If you have to wait in line you should. Our breakfast was hot and delicious. Service was outstanding. We had breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was so good we are going back tomorrow.
Hollywood Cafe,"I had pancakes and a fruit bowl. The pancakes were really good and that fruit bowl was gigantic. I was barely able to finish it. My husband had the Hollywood Hash brown and that took up the whole plate, he said it was delicious. He also this scrambled eggs in a croissant, one of the ones named after an actress, and there was nothing left of it. We had to take all his fruit to go."
Hollywood Cafe,Great breakfast. All good and fresh
Hollywood Cafe,Great place for a quick breakfast. The line out front indicates the quality of the food as does thr people talking about what they had yesterday. The menu is varied and the service is good.
Hollywood Cafe,Such a hidden gem! Wow!! The food was amazing. Really an amazing local place to visit!
Hollywood Cafe,My family and I visited Hollywood Cafe on Monday September 28th and also Tuesday. Both experiences were great. Staff very attentive. Food was great. Love how well they care for you in this critical times.
Hollywood Cafe,"Line out the door at 9:30, but moved quickly.  Heaping bowls od fresh fruit with some meals.  Accommodated custom order with graciously and accurately.  Very friendly wait staff.  Foid was enjoyed by us all"
Hollywood Cafe,Im glad I got there early. It gets full quickly. I wanted outdoor seating and only waited 15 minutes. Service was fast and they were very friendly! The good was delicious as well.
Hollywood Cafe,"Found this great place just 100 yards from our hotel.  My wife had the avocado salad with side of honey garlic fries. Me, because we'd been up since 3am and my body still needed breakfast, I had eggs, bacon and hash brown. All very well prepared and lots of it."
Hollywood Cafe,"The food was really good and the portions are generous. I just took off one star because the lady that came to attend the line was super rude. She asked how many and inside or outside and we said inside and she just said ok it's a long wait and continued to the next party. So my friend said oh can we change it to either, and the lady shushed my friend to stop talking. So rude.  Got the eggs Benedict with salmon and shrimp  and Hollywood hashbrowns. They were so good. I also asked for hash to be extra crispy. The toppings on the hash was omgahhhh tasty. The poached egg was cooked perfectly and was amazingly gooey. The salmon was a little too salty.  My friends ordered a side of fruit and it was so much fruit, very generous with portions.  We sat outside and the sun was really burning into my legs so careful if you don't like being hit by the sun."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great brunch, right along the lines of what I expected to spend for a busy brunch place, our food was fantastic as were the mimosas, we ate outside and it was a great day to do so there was a small canopy that covered the eating area from the light rain and we had a great time.  I highly recommend the mimosa flight and the gregory peck it treated me right for the beginning of a great vacation day."
Hollywood Cafe,Food was yummy. Small and cozy restaurant. The public washroom is located outside the restaurant.
Hollywood Cafe,"It’s overrated. French toast was unimpressive, I’ve had better at Village Inn and I don’t even like Village Inn lol... The cheesesteak burrito I had was very oily and bland... but the fries were good!"
Hollywood Cafe,It's very rare and most people like our food. Hopefully you will give us another try and we could help you with the menu.
Hollywood Cafe,"Arrived by myself at 1210 on Sunday. Got really lucky with a sidewalk table immediately. No wait. Five minutes later and there's a long line already formed. Ordered the Healthy Choice brunch, which was totally stunning. So much fresh fruit.....  And eggs. Delicious."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great breakfast, get there early or be prepared to wait in line (it moves fairly quick). They have a pretty delicious sounding array of omelettes, pancakes, French toasts, and benedicts.  The sweet bacon looked inticing but I didn't get any. I got the hash burrito and it was good! Hit the spot. Especially with a little Cholula hot sauce. Mmmmm. Pancakes were pretty good too, the fruit that came on the side was probably the best thing about the meal! I'd go again and definitely order a fruit bowl or something."
Hollywood Cafe,"One of my preferred spots for delicious Cafe food. got there near six, it wasn't packed at all. staff treated us so nice. prices are appropriate for the quality. atmosphere is similar to a place in columbus i loved."
Hollywood Cafe,Ate here on day six of our SF visit and so far my favorite meal. My meat lover's omelette and wife's Audry Hepburn pancakes were delicious including all the sides that came with it. Also some of the best coffee we have had since being here.
Hollywood Cafe,"""kind waitress, we'll be out of here soon"" - me  ""good"" - kind waitress  The bad service I experienced here is nothing new but never have I experienced such rude attitude from a waitress. The bathrooms are filthy, the food is mediocre, and the service is the worst!  Certainly a tourist trap which would explain all the high reviews but this place is crap compared to the SF breakfast heavyweights such as Dotties and Mama's. Both places have much better food and service."
Hollywood Cafe,"Decent but not exceptional. It will warrant a second try.  The menu was either traditional or uninspiring. I'm not sure which. But the execution was above average. The service was excellent, prompt and courteous.  The place is a bit small and awkwardly shaped. The outside seating is a nice touch and makes it look nicer than it is. Most importantly, the space seems very clean."
Hollywood Cafe,"Food was mediocre, flies were landing on my food so I couldn’t even eat some of it. Only good thing was the mimosa"
Hollywood Cafe,Food and service were great!
Hollywood Cafe,Great fresh food! Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious. Service excellent!
Hollywood Cafe,I've never been before but it was crowded in the food was really good service was great as well we outdoors on the sidewalk in their enclosed semi enclosed area it was good I'd go again
Hollywood Cafe,Tiny pancakes and no combination plate for them. I had to order an expensive side of bacon. The fresh fruit was the best part of everyone's meal.
Hollywood Cafe,Good place to grab a little breakfast. Friendly staff. Deco and atmosphere leave a little bit to be desired but well worth a visit in my opinion.
Hollywood Cafe,Last place we ate at in San Francisco before our flight. Hollywood Cafe came highly recommended to us by our Uber driver and the food did not disappoint thankfully! I highly recommend this restaurant 👌 …
Hollywood Cafe,Good real food that tastes great. When i ordered french toast with a fruit bowl i was not disappoint. The fruit bowl was a legitimate bowl of fruit over flowing with plenty to choose from. The frebch toast was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Very much would recommen.
Hollywood Cafe,Unexpectedly Great food at a convent location.
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent breakfast, decently priced. Very busy. If you plan on having breakfast arrive right at 7am. Otherwise be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. But worth the wait.  Also try Joannies which is about .4 miles away for a similar breakfast."
Hollywood Cafe,I had the old fashioned eggs with Hollywood hashbrowns. It was excellent! My wife had the club sandwich which was also very good but she did not like the honey garlic addition.
Hollywood Cafe,"Had perfectly made eggs Benedict for $13.50. husband had crab omelet for only $15.00 which is very reasonable. However, the crab was a bit on the fishy side which is the reason for 4 stars. Service was great and line moves quickly."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food, great customer service, and great location! Even thought they were busy, they still managed to bring out the food within 15 minutes! They operated very seamlessly! DEFINITELY  RECOMMEND!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Disappointing breakfast. Scrambled eggs over cooked (lots of brown spots).  Not good. Hash browns should be fluffy, not hard and compressed into a flat potato puck requiring a sharp knife to cut. Toast was good. Overall it was like having a ten-year-old try to cook you a good Father's Day meal and being somewhat overwhelmed by the task."
Hollywood Cafe,I love the rancheros from the menu and the friendly staff from the cafe 🥰 …
Hollywood Cafe,"food was awesome, service exceptional"
Hollywood Cafe,"Whilst the food looked nice, after an extensive wait and no acknowledgement from any of the waiting staff, we left and went to dennys. Have visited similar restaurants with queues out the door so important to have someone on the waiting staff who looks assertive and in control to be sure ppl get seated accordingly. We put our name on the list on arrival but after half an hour of waiting and no communication from any of the serving staff, we'd had enough."
Hollywood Cafe,"Very tiny restaurant with an often extensive wait. The food was good but not worth standing in the cold for. I think a lot of the people come here because of the hype. I had pancakes, eggs, toast, and hot chocolate. Nothing im my meal was that special. If there isn't a wait, sure go for it. If there is, try somewhere else."
Hollywood Cafe,"If you're looking for a place with awesome food and great wait staff and customer service, this is the place! The staff was very nice and respectful and quick to seat us and the food came out quickly and was amazing!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Fantastic breakfast at a pleasant sidewalk table.  It's (mostly) out of the wind, so if you have a sunny day it's a great outdoor spot.  Very touristy and expect to wait, but the food was worth it."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place for breakfast.   Hashbrown patties were lame, for a $25 breakfast entre."
Hollywood Cafe,"Simple, Fresh and Homely place. Great service."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great service, generous plates and delicious food! We where 2 days in a nearby hotel and after our first breakfast we decided to go back the next day."
Hollywood Cafe,"The food here is excellent. The ingredients are fresh and some menu items are somewhat of a different take on classic favorites, but are delicious. The seating area is rather limited, but if you have to wait it is well worth it"
Hollywood Cafe,"This is one of the best places to have breakfast in San Francisco for sure. I have been here twice and have tried couple of items from the menu and none of them have disappointed me. The restaurant opens at 7AM and is open only till lunch time (1:45PM) and it is almost always crowded. My first visit was just 10mins after it opened (7:10AM) and it was crowded (I was able to find table only because I was alone).  Food: They typically start off with serving coffee which is again great and much essential to kick-start your day.  Food is central to any successful restaurant and Hollywood Cafe nails it hands down. In two visits, we have tried vegetarian omelette and BAT (sans bacon) (typically served with hash browns and toasted sourdough bread), vanilla-banana french toast, veggie burger (served with french fries). The food is absolutely delicious and makes up for an amazing breakfast. Especially the deep fried food, which can easily turn very greasy, wasn't very oily and great in taste.  Ambiance: The ambiance lives up to the name as you see framed photos of hollywood stars on one of the walls. The place is, however, a little cramped. At any place, you would be sitting just centimeters away from your next table. However, the glass wall on the road side makes up for the required natural light which doesn't make the space suffocating. There is a sitting arrangement outside as well for those who want to have their meal outdoors.  Service: The service is quite good for the amount of rush they receive. Our order didn't take much time to arrive. The guy who normally serves coffee checks in regularly if you need a refill and makes sure your mug is never empty. The staff is quite friendly and calm, although quite eager to serve you a check once you're almost done with your meal without checking if we would like to have something else.  If you're visiting San Francisco then Hollywood Cafe is a must in your itinerary."
Hollywood Cafe,"At first sight I had a good impression but then I didn't enjoy their service. I was squeezed on a quite narrow table (what was still quite OK for me as I was alone). I had to leave my jacket on, as the doors were kept open. It was not actually freezing, but it wasn't very cosy. The eggs benedict with bacon didn't come with bacon, but with a kind of a round shaped slice of ham/sausage (what I really didn't like), but ok...  I still hadn't finished my cappuccino when they were already encouraging me to hurry up, because there was was a long line... When I paid the guy at the cashier wouldn't even wait a second to let me sign the receipt and give it back to him but already ran away. The first time ever that I decided not to leave a tip when in the USA! The prices are ok for US-standard and considering the zone (to Europeans they still seem quite high), but still one would like to have the time to finish his coffee...In the end I didn't even bother to complain about the  barbecue issue, because I had the impression no one would care. Maybe I just had bad luck, but my experience was not good..."
Hollywood Cafe,"I am a huge fan of Hollywood Cafe. + Outdoor and indoor seating available. Outdoor is dog friendly + Friendly servers + Great selection of breakfast and lunch foods + Omelettes are good + Mimosas (and mimosa flights - orange, mango, grapefruit) + Club sandwich is good + Benedicts are good + French toast is good + Note also their french fries are super crispy and delicious"
Hollywood Cafe,Great food and the line was worth the wait
Hollywood Cafe,Got the scrambled eggs and chorizo. Fantastic!
Hollywood Cafe,"I keep reading all the positive reviews that have No supporting description as to what made it good, great, or amazing.  My experience on May 8th was totally different than everyone else's and the Kitchen staff and Management failed. I ordered the Ham and Cheese Omelet and asked for it to be soft and Not overcooked.  Unfortunately the cook only knows one way and it is to cook the life and flavor out of the Omelet and the accompanying hash browns.  The Ham and Cheese Omelet was dry, had little cheese or egg flavor.  I sent it back and asked if they can make me some scrambled eggs instead.  I watch the cook in the front right take my omelet put it in a pan, add butter, a little more cheese and break it apart by hand.  Plates said concoction and server serves it to me.  Hmmmm,  I get it, Hollywood Café and this is a joke right?  No this was real.  I tasted the dark brown hash brown that resemble the Home Depot Model 10372031 door mat and it was dry, had No onion or other detectable flavors.  The servers were great, attentive and doing the only thing they are paid to do and that is handle service and not cook.  The two pieces of fruit that garnished the plate were plump and tasty.  After going on the Hollywood Warner Brothers studio tour and seeing how some things are fake in TV and Movies, I have to believe that most of these reviews are Fake or from people who I wouldn't place much value on their opinion when it comes to food."
Hollywood Cafe,Honestly it was amazing!! Every person at the table loved their food. We came from out of town and stopped in and the service was so super fast and the employees were very nice! The fifteen minute wait was definitely worth it!!!
Hollywood Cafe,Good food and very nice Thai staff!
Hollywood Cafe,"Standard good brunch. The decorations inside were charming. Chicken sandwich was good, the chicken tasted pretty fresh. Crab omelette was filled with an abundant amount of crab, which was nice."
Hollywood Cafe,"It was our first time here and we left very full and very happy. Service was Great and fruit was amazing. The food was to die for. My spot for the next time we are in SF. You won't be dissapointed. Did I mention they are fast and always check up on you even if they are busy, I loved that about them.  I recommend this place, definitly!!!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Tourist trap. Food is very good but then it's hard to mess up breakfast. The wait is ridiculous. Several times we just went to another diner and got immediate seating. When we finally got into this one, the food wasn't any better or worse. But the prices sure were higher."
Hollywood Cafe,"Long list of choices on the menu. Great service, great food. A bright cheery place to start the day. The banana topped French toast was a terrific treat."
Hollywood Cafe,"There was lots of people waiting. I had to wait about 30 minutes, but the food was great! I loved fruits coming out with almost all of the menu. I recommend menu titled with Hollywood stars' name:)"
Hollywood Cafe,"Wonderful food, very fresh. The service was fast and great. The coffee was delicious.  We we're very pleasantly surprised...we will be back every time we're in the bay area."
Hollywood Cafe,"Food is good and tasty. The fresh fruit with the pancakes tastes perfect even better than syrup. Fresh,cold orange juice is the perfect mate for any breakfast plate."
Hollywood Cafe,One of my favorite breakfast places in the city. Line can get long but the wait is worth it. Food is awesome and service is always wonderful.
Hollywood Cafe,"This place is amazing . Food was excellent. Compliments to a great server, Toby. I will be coming back when I'm im town! Thanks Toby!!"
Hollywood Cafe,It's good.  Not spectacular but good.  But it's tough to stand out in the breakfast place crowd.  I'd go back.
Hollywood Cafe,"being in such a touristy area of san francisco, you're expecting to get ripped off...but they're reasonably priced.  the french toast is the best! get any menu item as long as french toast is one of the items. i got the french toast and fruit, my wife got the french toast combo w/ the hash browns and chicken apple sausages.  fresh fruit is not standard orange slice fare either. i got blueberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, banana. i dipped my fruit on the syrup given to me for the french toast. tasty. orange juice at this place is good too. get there early.  very crowded."
Hollywood Cafe,Great food and fast service. The fruit is delicious and plentiful. The crab omelette was outstanding. Definitely our favorite breakfast place in San Francisco.
Hollywood Cafe,"Packed crowd, but the staff hustles to turn tables over quickly. You won't wait too long to get a table even with a long line. Food was breakfast staples and reasonably priced... especially for San Francisco."
Hollywood Cafe,We loved this local cafe. The food was good and we enjoyed the feel of this cafe. Great breakfast find. The only reason we don’t give 5 stars is the French toast wasn’t as good as we hoped.
Hollywood Cafe,Very nice breakfast place a couple of block from Fisherman's wharf in San Francisco. The food is delicious. The service is fast and great.
Hollywood Cafe,"I've eaten breakfast here several times, and each time the food is fresh, the fruit is piled high, the hash browns are monstrous, and the atmosphere is diner-classic. Breakfast is exactly consistent each time I've been. I consider Hollywood a Wharf classic."
Hollywood Cafe,Delicious French toast with plantains and berries! Would fly to San Francisco just to have breakfast here again...
Hollywood Cafe,The food is fresh and well prepared. The service was good. We ate here three days in a row. The wait time for a table was around 20-30 minutes. Worth it.
Hollywood Cafe,Good. Nothing really special though
Hollywood Cafe,"Good Breakfast. Everything seems fresh and it tastes great. Little bit over priced, but still ok. sometimes staff seems a little bit to push on time. Come early to get an available seat."
Hollywood Cafe,"I went there and the pancakes were chewy like if they were frozen, and they made me feel un welcome. Plus they charged us almost $30 extra in tips, and taxes, they didn’t tell us that they charge the tips already until we got out tab.. I wouldn’t recommend this place at all.. TAKE MY ADVICE..!"
Hollywood Cafe,Lovely breakfast friendly staff nothing was a problem for them.
Hollywood Cafe,Best breakfast very fresh a little pricey but worth it
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food! Perfect bacon, good coffee, and lots of fresh fruit available. 4 stars only because of the long wait standing outside (about half an hour). Worth it!"
Hollywood Cafe,"I've eaten at a ton of breakfast spots around the country and also in the Wharf area of San Francisco, this is the best in the area and one of the top 3 I have ever been to. Hashbrowns were top notch and  service was on point."
Hollywood Cafe,"I just love when they randomly switch their opening time from 7am to 8am. Very convenient!  Why is the floor sticky when they just opened?  Why is the waitstaff just arriving for work 1 minute before they open?  Why is the manager/owner(?) wearing a latex glove on only ONE hand?  Why did my waitress need to look at the menu to know what the “Mairilyn Monroe” came with?  Why is the waitress rude and angry only 12 minutes after opening? If she’s this sour this early in the day, imagine her demeanor at 10 or 11am. 🤬  Why did it take 17 minutes for my wife’s cappuccino to arrive? Were they growing and grinding their own beans in the back? And when it arrived, why was it 40% foam, with only 60% coffee? She literally had to spoon up the foam to get to the coffee.  Why does this cafe think that “steak tips” means a hamburger patty? Even IHOP knows how to do this correctly.  Why do the “hash browns” look and taste like a wet blanket?  “Join me...perhaps you can help solve these mysteries.” —Robert Stack"
Hollywood Cafe,"Eye watering prices (£ to $ didnt help) but great food, quick service and superb coffee. Go 😊"
Hollywood Cafe,Wait was average however eating outside was a bit miserable. It was about 1100 and the sun was baking on the plexiglass and it was like a sweat box food was good.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place for breakfast. Go early to get a table and don´t be surprised if you already see people lining up in fron of the door 10 minutes after open. You usually don´t need to wait too long, so don´t let that turn you away."
Hollywood Cafe,I pick up Postmates orders here from time to time and they're always very helpful and friendly. So if you don't want to stand in a long line that's there on almost every Saturday and Sunday and maybe all week use Postmates and stay in your home or hotel room and have it delivered to you.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great restaurant with reasonable prices considering how generous portions are. I really enjoyed my coffee, fresh and hot, and different waiters arrived to refill it. Service was really good, the staff was attentive and courteous."
Hollywood Cafe,I don't like sitting outside my food gets cold very fast. Food was okay and the service was okay too.
Hollywood Cafe,Very good pancakes!
Hollywood Cafe,Honestly I don't understand the appeal. The food was very just ok. I can't figure out why it is so highly rated. There has to be better breakfast food in San Francisco at a similar price point.
Hollywood Cafe,"What a surprise!  One of the best breakfasts that we found in San Francisco.  Healthy options, all fresh ingredients.  There's a line that forms early, but it's not a terribly long wait, and well worth it."
Hollywood Cafe,Oily....fatty...tasteless .....Burrito hardly warm. Worst meal I tried to eat in SF....and that is saying a lot....
Hollywood Cafe,"Best place i had breakfast so far. The service was outstanding, the food was great. Portions are big but my son had seconds."
Hollywood Cafe,Scrumdiddleumptious.
Hollywood Cafe,Cool cafe to sit down and enjoy great food. Try the gregory peck and salmon-shrimp egg benedicts.  Most dishes range from USD 8 to 19.  You can also order online and get it delivered to your doorstep - this is a cool feature for tourists in nearby hotels.
Hollywood Cafe,My husband and I are planning our entire trip to San Francisco around being able to have breakfast here every morning before we start our exploring. We love this place! The food is incredible!
Hollywood Cafe,"Pretty average, I guess Americans would love this kind of diner, but I found it not special, especially when theres that amazing Brazilian place around the corner. The issue is that the food misses seasoning in my taste, it was bland"
Hollywood Cafe,"We randomly found this place, while passing by looking for breakfast.  WOW! the food here is amazing.  LONG LINES! but totally worth the wait.  we almost left the line till someone told us that it's ""worth the wait""  ITS TRUE! will visit here again"
Hollywood Cafe,"Great find! across from our hotel. Super fresh, great service! The fruit cup was awesome! Why did we eat in the hotel for breakfast? Small place but worth the wait!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Don't come here unless you're hungry! Plates full of food, fresh fruit - all of it great!. Service is both pleasant and FAST! Coffee drinks superb! Go early if you can!"
Hollywood Cafe,"All I’m going to say is I ordered the very expensive (for what it is) Avocado Toast on Postmates. I received a slice of mediocre multi grain like bread with (6) little slices of avocado in the middle and a poached egg, that’s it, nothing else. I called the restaurant to ask if that’s how they usually serve it or if it was a mistake, They confirmed that that’s what you get. I couldn’t help but asking the person on the phone if they had ever had an avocado toast anywhere else and he said yes but that’s how they served it there. I will not order food from here again."
Hollywood Cafe,Service NOT good at all Coffee was disgusting And the crab omelet horrible they dont do anything with it just take it out of the can and put inside the omelet.... Never again will i be going here and overpriced food thats NOT good at all
Hollywood Cafe,This is very rare to hear. People love our coffee and the crab omelette is one of the most popular dishes here. We are so sorry to hear that you didn't enjoy the food. We are trying and working really hard to make sure you enjoy dining in with us. Please give us another try and we can help guide you through the menu.
Hollywood Cafe,Great food! Oversized omelettes and French toast that’s guaranteed to please your kids. Great place at fisherman’s wharf.
Hollywood Cafe,I would recommend this place for breakfast.  Surprisingly great breakfast! The waits may be long and the atmosphere is lacking. But the food was filling and delicious.
Hollywood Cafe,The food and service was outstanding. This cafe has the best fresh fruit plate I have ever seen or tasted. I would highly recommend going here.
Hollywood Cafe,Food is delicious. Great variety on the menu. Outstanding service!
Hollywood Cafe,"I didn’t like the food , it didn’t taste good at all, I was charged $20 for only French toast and eggs and a cup of milk and they charged me almost $15 in tips and taxes and I asked them to show me proofs of policy where I had to pay a lot in tips and they couldn’t find anything. I don’t recommend this place at all."
Hollywood Cafe,"Food, coffee and service were good."
Hollywood Cafe,If you are staying in Fishermans Wharf you're gonna want to eat at Hollywood Cafe for Breakfast. with a menu that includes healthier choices such as their fresh fruit bowl. Many Other places on Fishermans Wharf have outrageous prices for breakfast. not at Hollywood Cafe. Very relaxing atmosphere to get you fed and ready for your days activities.
Hollywood Cafe,"Very rude, worst service ever.. I really didn't expect such behaviour from a highly rated restaurant.. We were a group of 10, booked our table the day before.. some of us arrived earlier, so not waste any time the first group wanted to order.. Hi, can we order please.. Where are the rest of the group? On the way.. No, you can order when the rest are here! But we will order for them! No,, u booked for 10, I will only take the order when the whole group is here!  We left after this conversation.."
Hollywood Cafe,Convenient location. Good food
Hollywood Cafe,"Good, but kind of expensive (even for San Francisco) in return for the amount and quality of food received. It was okay but nothing special."
Hollywood Cafe,"Nice food, fast service.."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great atmosphere and fast service. Especially early in the morning. Great location to Fisherman's Warf. The food was absolutely delicious and came with more than enough, and the sourdough toast was amazing."
Hollywood Cafe,Absolutely a great place for breakfast!  Food is so good and fresh.  The fruit bowl is amazing.  Service is exceptional.
Hollywood Cafe,Great food! Mimosas were delicious! And service was relatively quick. Would eat here again.
Hollywood Cafe,"Very disappointed. Chai latte was tasteless, French toast was cold, bacon was not bacon, holandese sauce had too much lemon, syrup was tasteless. Don't understand why this cafe is so highly rated."
Hollywood Cafe,very good service and very good breakfast
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place for breakfast... egg benedict with salmon was amazing. Even though there was a queue, service was fast and didn't have to wait too long"
Hollywood Cafe,Very delish breakfast! Super friendly and quick staff
Hollywood Cafe,"Queues, queues, queues, but the food is worth it. Especially those pancakes with tons of fruit and maple syrup will help you start your day with a smile. An unexpected delight of San Francisco."
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food, awesome pancakes. Excellent service"
Hollywood Cafe,I love this place. Don't let the waiting time discourage you. I waited 5 minutes but the service was fast and great.  The food and coffee were excellent.
Hollywood Cafe,"Fantastic food and great location, we only heard about this place on our last day but wish we'd found out about it earlier. Staff we're brilliant and so much fresh fruit with the order it was great, if your in town check it out!!"
Hollywood Cafe,This is my second experience with Hollywood Cafe. Both times the food has been very good and very fresh! The service was also fast and friendly. This will be a regular stop when I'm visiting the Bay Area in the future.
Hollywood Cafe,"This place offers really good as well as healthy breakfasts. We were attracted by the queue of people waiting outside. It's really worth the wait, give this place a try if your nearby!"
Hollywood Cafe,Nice breakfast in interesting atmosphere. Close to fisherman's wharf and recommended by locals. Busy with conference and toast left off but quickly and politely given.
Hollywood Cafe,Outstanding!  Went yesterday.   Best breakfast I've had.  Worth every penny and the wait! Try the Dolce or Eggs benedict.  Going back again today!
Hollywood Cafe,Probably the best breakfast in the highly touristy areas around fisherman's wharf. Portion sizes are decent (not enormous like the typical American meal)  Eggs Benedict is my recommendation
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent diner with friendly staff and tasty breakfast.  My breakfast favorite is the eggs Benedict, but everyone in the family had a great meal"
Hollywood Cafe,"Busy place, but it's worth the wait.  Great food, huge portions and excellent service. Definitely recommend!"
Hollywood Cafe,"When that one child is adamant about breakfast on Fisherman's Wharf and the rest of the family wants lunch this is the spot to go.  Eggs Benedict with hash browns, BLT with fries, Huevos Rancheros, and Bittersweet Mimosa (grapefruit) hit the spot."
Hollywood Cafe,We will make darn sure we make time to have breakfast in between fun time it is such a great place you just don't get quickness and personal confirsation !🚜🍳
Hollywood Cafe,Best ham and cheese omelette I’ve ever had. We ate there every morning on our week-long SF vacation.
Hollywood Cafe,"Amazing customer service and of course the food. The french toast is no joke, definitely my go to breakfast spot."
Hollywood Cafe,Loved the place. Nice location. There was a cue outside the cafe and the wait time was 20 min. The food tastes good. The quantity of food was very good.
Hollywood Cafe,Sat down and waited 20 minutes had to get my own menu me and my family ended up leaving went to a restaurant down the street and we're seated given drinks and took our order in 15 minutes
Hollywood Cafe,"We are sorry to hear you didn't enjoy your time with us. The scan menu is on every tables and normally you will have to wait in the line to be seated or wait to see the hostess. Hopefully, you will understand and give us another try. Thank you so much."
Hollywood Cafe,"Was there couple years ago, awesome as ever with hollywood theme"
Hollywood Cafe,The food was decent and the service was professional.  Prices are way too high.
Hollywood Cafe,"Good food.  Good service.  Early morning wait was fairly short.  Waiting for a table,  one stands in line one the sidewalk,  thank goodness we had fair weather."
Hollywood Cafe,"Love it!  Everyone complains abt the Q. It's not that long of a wait. I went there every time I visit SF, it is super fast actually.Jst max 10 mins wait. They serve very fast after you order too. The hash brown is to die for! Jst 1 block from Powell-Mason Cable Car Last Stop."
Hollywood Cafe,"Large-ish portions, avg run of the mill tasting breakfast. PERFECT location for business. Surrounded by multiple hotels for a line in the morning that is perpetual. The sourdough is good though."
Hollywood Cafe,Food is consistently good and overall a nice breakfast spot
Hollywood Cafe,Good place to eat breakfast usually packed people wait outside but fast to get a table if you have a small group. I recommend the hash burrito has a special creamy sauce.
Hollywood Cafe,"The food and service is really good, but be prepared to wait outside. The breakfasts are large and worth the price."
Hollywood Cafe,The service was friendly and prompt. Excellent food! Highly recommend anything that includes the fruit bowl. The fruit was very fresh and flavorful!
Hollywood Cafe,"Service was great, food was delicious. The hot chocolate was a little grimy & the prices were a little high, but it is what you would expect for a San Francisco tourist trap."
Hollywood Cafe,Food was great! Ordered the steak and eggs. Steak ground and in patty form. But it was great flavor
Hollywood Cafe,"Great service, great food, big portions; & good prices for the area. If you are hungry this is the place to go ; can't go wrong!!! Everything is made fresh, you could actually see them prepare you food."
Hollywood Cafe,"The food, the service, the location...all 5 stars!"
Hollywood Cafe,It was very good as far as the food goes.....space not so much; however  my family and I shared a table with an Austrian couple travelling the U.S. and enjoyed their company! So all and all a good visit!
Hollywood Cafe,Family loved their breakfast! I had the chilaquiles.  Fantastic!  We will return.
Hollywood Cafe,"Excellent! Good food, fast service. Bottomless coffee. The only problem is that it's so popular that you might have to wait in line for a table."
Hollywood Cafe,Food was great! They are only open for breakfast and lunch.  We came close to close and server was in a hurry to leave but the food was great and fairly priced.  Always a line for breakfast.
Hollywood Cafe,Best place to have a pretty breakfast! Very busy but staff is polite
Hollywood Cafe,Great place to eat. Be prepared to queue for breakfast! Great variety of food and atmosphere great too.  I hope you enjoy as much as we did.
Hollywood Cafe,"Great place for breakfast (as other mentioned, very generous portion of fruits), highly recommended if. My only complain is the coffee - it was really terrible, avoid at all cost."
Hollywood Cafe,Everything was great! Best breakfast in FW! We tried several things in the menu and they were all very good
Hollywood Cafe,We really enjoyed breakfast here. All the food was fantastic and the service was great. I especially enjoyed the banana waffle.
Hollywood Cafe,"We start off by waiting in line, but it moves quickly and the food is worth the little wait. We were served quickly and the food was delicious! We may sneak back over there again for breakfast before we head home."
Hollywood Cafe,The chilaquiles are very good! The service was friendly and fast!
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent breakfast place. I reached around 7:50 am. By the time I finished my breakfast it was 8:30 and there was a huge queue of people waiting. And very inexpensive.
Hollywood Cafe,Not a bad place for a quick meal. Kind of a step above fast food. Everything seemed close and crowded. OK for a quick reasonably priced meal in SF.
Hollywood Cafe,"Delicious breakfast foods, great service, reasonable prices. All dishes were very good and the fruit was fantastic!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Great food and even though there is usually a wait, they turn tables around VERY fast.  We went at 9am on a saturday morning and only had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated outside."
Hollywood Cafe,Went here for breakfast numerous times in 2016. Brilliant food.
Hollywood Cafe,Fast service once you get a seat. Amazing food! Try the sweet bacon. Arrive early as this place is a favorite and lines up quick.
Hollywood Cafe,Very disappointed! The food  were very average for the price they charge. It's not worth to wait for a long time here. You can find any other better restaurant in this area .
Hollywood Cafe,"Food was good for a strong breakfast Seems like everything came with fruit Portions were large The pancakes filled me and the lil one The wife got an awesome breakfast sandwich that was large, with good presentation The eggs Benedict was beautiful and the teenager loved it!"
Hollywood Cafe,Had breakfast here. Huge portions with good prices. A good place to go if you're looking for a hearty breakfast in the area.
Hollywood Cafe,Great breakfast spot. Fresh fruit. Service was prompt and freindly. Kinda tiny and a little gimmicky on the Hollywood stuff. Cheaper and better than the IHOP on Beach and Powell.
Hollywood Cafe,I like this yummy
Hollywood Cafe,"A great place for breakfast if you are staying in one of the local hotels and want a cheaper option. Friendly, attentive staff with prompt service."
Hollywood Cafe,"Vivian Lee and Gregory Peck breakfast plates were excellent. Good value, a lot of food."
Hollywood Cafe,"First come serve. We arrived at 9:30am, waited 15 mins. Great food & lots of it!! Great service!! Would visit again!!"
Hollywood Cafe,"This place was my favorite!  Their customer service was amazing and their food was incredible, highly recommend it.  The wait wasn’t to bad, moves quickly."
Hollywood Cafe,We stayed across the street at the Hyatt Centric. We saw this place and second guess it because of its small size but every morning the line out front said something about this place. We waited in line not to long and then had fast and amazing service from everyone. The food was sooo good.
Hollywood Cafe,"Delicious food and super nice wait staff! Be careful though, a line forms very early in the day so make sure to time your visit."
Hollywood Cafe,Amazing food at incredible prices. Extremely polite service and comfortable decor. The only slightly negative thing in a hugely positive experience is their restroom facilities. They are in an adjacent building and not in compliance with the cafe's decor
Hollywood Cafe,This place is great...very good taste and service
Hollywood Cafe,Best Service. Perfect food. And the staff makes it easier for you to alter food options according to your choices. Veg options available.
Hollywood Cafe,Really good food.  Plenty of outdoor seating.
Hollywood Cafe,Excellent place to have Breakfast
Hollywood Cafe,Soooo good. Fresh fruits with breakfast . They have a kids menu. Fast & friendly
Hollywood Cafe,Thank you so much Libby and we can't wait to serve you again soon.
Hollywood Cafe,Good food but alittle expensive. 80$ for 2 adults 2 kids breakfast.
Hollywood Cafe,"Went here b/c of the reviews and it didn’t disappoint! Super busy, worth the wait. Only downfall was the water, yuck city water, but food amazing!"
Hollywood Cafe,"Delicious! Had the combo, french toast, two eggs with bacon! Cooked and served timely...yum, yum!"
Hollywood Cafe,Great food. Highly recommend
Hollywood Cafe,Their service was fast despite being in the middle of a rush. And when we got our food we were not dissapointed. This is a must visit if you're in San Francisco!
Hollywood Cafe,Really great breakfast and the staff had excellent service. Loved it.
Hollywood Cafe,"Thank you so much for your kind words, Mark. We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us. Please stop in again soon."
