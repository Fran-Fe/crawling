Four Barrel Coffee,"First and foremost, this shop is really focused on the quality of their coffee - it was one of the best lattes I’ve had in a while. If you’re looking for a place with specialty drinks full of flavorings and frills, this is not the place for you. However, if you are a coffee purist just looking for a good brew, you would be remiss to pass this spot by.  In addition their pastries are very good and made fresh daily. Plenty of seating here as well which is always a plus."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, but the coffee was meh. I was hoping for some great coffee since they make their own beans on site. I also got a cappuccino but it was more like a latte ☕️"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Four Barrel Coffee in San Francisco's Mission District impressed me with their exceptional cappuccino. From the moment I entered, the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel welcome. The cappuccino itself was expertly prepared, with a perfect balance of rich espresso and velvety steamed milk. The attention to detail, including beautiful latte art, added to the overall experience. Four Barrel Coffee's commitment to sourcing high-quality beans and ethical practices is commendable. While it can get busy, the wait is worth it. Overall, Four Barrel Coffee is a must-visit for coffee lovers."
Four Barrel Coffee,"A coffee powerhouse. Unlike other coffee shops in the city, it has plenty of space inside and out. Good selection of quality coffee. My mocha was pretty good (I'd say 4 out of 5) - good balance of chocolate, coffee, and milk. I loved that it was not sugary at all. The only issue is parking which is scarce, expensive, and not safe in this area."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee and service from the baristas. It’s pretty cool that you get to see them roast and packing the beans real-time. Always a line for restroom though.
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place is awesome! The coffee is hands down the best in the city and it's so fun to watch them roast it right there on site. And the space itself is great, with a great vibe that's only made better by the vinyl-only music selection.  We love that there's no wifi - it's a chance to unplug and just enjoy the delicious coffee. The staff is super friendly, and they always make us feel welcome. And the cherry on top? The art exhibitions they have on a regular basis that just add to the already fun atmosphere.  We highly recommend this coffee shop to anyone looking for a good time in San Francisco. It's one of our go-to spots and if you don’t like coffee you can still get their delicious hot chocolate. 🤤☀️"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I love the tree in the cafe. Spring is coming. Feel so cozy, random sitting inside with a cup of coffee. Coffee taste so good with the smooth milk. You can tell the barista enjoys making every cup of coffee to make it look good and taste good."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Chic, artsy, and comfy place to chat or get some work done on the top of Valencia street. Love the interior design, the name is very fitting as well once you go inside. It was cool to see they offer coffee making classes as well!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great place for coffee, iced hibiscus tea, recommend excellent lavender cookie!! Great atmosphere to..just sit or work on the laptop"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Definitely not the best coffee in the world. I regretted ordering the Nitro after hopping in an Uber and almost puking my guts out. Mocha was bland as well. The croissant was alright, we ordered a chocolate one and all they did was shove little Hersheys in the there. Didn’t even warm it up for us. Wouldn’t really recommend this place when there is better options less than 2 blocks in either direction"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Yayyyy, I loved this place. Huuuuge space. Nice staff. Mellow vibe. I talked to the barista, super nice. There’s cool art on the walls and hanging from the ceiling. I got a macchiato and my wife got a mocha and an earl grey lavender bread. My drink was perfect and the bread was delicious. I would come here again."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Plenty of willing patrons and it's no surprise. The coffee is outstanding. Today's espresso was potentially the best I've ever had; bitter, smooth and sweet 👌"
Four Barrel Coffee,deeeelicious coffee in a gorgeous space! highly recommend 😋 …
Four Barrel Coffee,"Home-roasted coffee beans are fragrant. If you do PC work here, it will progress."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Their drip coffee is one of the bests in the area! If you like espresso drinks, their latte is also amazing! rich and creamy. The space is nice and cozy, but they do not have wifi."
Four Barrel Coffee,One of our favourite coffees in SF. Consistently amazing coffee. Almost always have the cappuccino. Occasionally a croissant. Strong and flavourful. Tastes great with oat milk as well. Mustn’t miss if in mission.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Barista was incredibly rude when asked if they had flavored lattes. I’m sorry for not knowing the complete in’s and out’s of your menu, I think it’s a pretty reasonable question to ask if I’m there for the first time. So much unnecessary attitude from the barista. Will definitely be taking my business to the other amazing coffee places on Valencia."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee quality (clear flavor profile) is some of the best in the bay. Drip from the counter is always excellent, but recommend the pour over bar if you’re really looking for some next level flavor and insight."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Four barrel is simply great coffee. If you like it stronger, I’d suggest trying the cappuccino instead of the latte. Either way, guaranteed delicious every time.  Great use of public parklet. They’re super busy when you need them the most, but no fault there!"
Four Barrel Coffee,Loved it here - was looking for a cool non-chain coffee place during my time in SF and this was perfect. Coffee was lovely and high quality bean!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Spacious, minimal, soft wood-and-concrete interior. Coffee good. Unique pastries."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good coffee!  Tried their cappuccino, latte, and mocha. Mocha is my favorite. If you want your coffee strong go for cappuccino, otherwise go for latte. If you  are a chocolate lover, go for mocha!  Staff are friendly. They have opened up their indoor seating too.  Will definitely go back if I am in the neighborhood!"
Four Barrel Coffee,Nice large coffee house in the Mission neighborhood. They have free coffee during the weekends around 1230 time from. They roast their own coffee and you can see then doing it during certain parts of the day. They have plenty of  seating here and there are tables that  can accommodate up to 8 people. There is also an all gender bathroom here as well. The pastries tasted great as well!  Worth checking out!
Four Barrel Coffee,Hot chocolate was ok. Was expecting something mind blowing from the reviews and the price point (over $7 when you tip). Tasted sort of like a milk chocolatey flavor.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Totally the top end of great coffee any city can hope to offer. Other than exceptional coffee, one will be hard pressed to find seating or a smile from the hosts or baristas. Nonetheless very professionally run outfit with the best of coffees."
Four Barrel Coffee,One of the best coffee places you can go to. The coffee has a distinguished and raw taste. It was refreshing. I like that they serve the basic raw coffees and not the flavoured ones. It's a roastery and you can tell from the freshness of the coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,"This coffee shop is beautiful inside. It is tastefully decorated and has a very relaxed atmosphere. It's very spacious and has plenty of room for you to sit and chat or to work on your laptop.  The coffee was delicious. If you're looking for something to nibble on they also have sweet and savoury snacks.  They sell mugs, beans and more!"
Four Barrel Coffee,I loved this place! Amazing vibe and super friendly staff! Definitely one of my favorite cafes in San Francisco
Four Barrel Coffee,"Agreed with all the reviews saying how cute this place is! Natural chic with a beautiful, simple design. Hannah was such a friendly server who made my first visit very enjoyable. There espresso cups are the most beautiful mint hue and if I could’ve stayed longer just to read a book, I’m sure I would have! Luckily their coffee is offered at other fine pastry shops all around town. But if you can check out this Valencia location, you would definitely be doing yourself a favor. Enjoy!"
Four Barrel Coffee,I was looking forward to loving this place as it was highly recommended by couple friends who go there regularly every Saturday morning.  We visited July 23rd in the pm hours after a long stroll in the city.  The place was really nice with the wooden feel and so airy. You could see the coffee roasters in the back.  Self service at the counter.  What I didn't like is how cold the coffee/hot cocoa was. None of the four of us enjoyed that and the taste wasn't that good either. Can't say I will be back.
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place is really charming and it has a cool vibe, they have a lot of options besides coffee like cold beverages, muffins, bagels and even items related to coffee.  I went with a friend and we had 2 espressos, and let me tell you that the coffee was really awful, we could barely drink it. So, I recommend you to come here if you wanna have something other than coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best coffee shops in the neighborhood. Quality is super consistent. Wish they had WiFi.. plenty of people always hang out there working on their laptops anyway, show some love for those of us without unlimited mobile data!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This hipster coffee spot is a trendy and modern establishment. In the back of the cafe you can clearly see the team roasting the coffee that is distributed elsewhere and used in the shop to make the coffee they serve.  The coffee is a dark and strong, even with their mocha you could easily taste the coffee through the chocolate.  The genderless bathroom was a nice touch and a made the place seem incredibly inclusive.  Worth a stop with a lot of seating and very open with high ceilings."
Four Barrel Coffee,Cool coffee shop with huge display and operation of baking coffee beans. Coffee was great. It like a beloved community coffee shop that people step in nonstop.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I've tried many coffee places all over the city and the Bay Area.  For me, Four Barrel still makes the best coffee and espresso shot.  Love the fact that they give you some sparkling water to go with your espresso! Price wise, you pay about a average price for a shot of espresso ($3.75) and a Latte ($5).  They use quality beans for roasting and you can actually taste the difference.  The gals that work there are very friendly.  Other items like donuts or pastries are sold as well.  Difficult street parking."
Four Barrel Coffee,Best coffee spot in the city hands down. No pretentious vibes from the baristas. Aggressive hipsters seem to keep to themselves despite being located balls deep on Valencia st. 11/10 would work out of again while enjoying LPs of whatever the employees are in the mood for.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I went there last week for latte, it taste really bad. Their latte was very good before not sure why their quality suddenly dropped. I want to give them a second chance so I went there again this week and ordered mocha, it‘a disappointing, it’s more sour this time! Please make improvement."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Lovely space with nice parklet seating. The coffee and pastries are both good, and interesting people are always stopping by. Local art is a nice touch. Great place to sit and read- no wifi though."
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee and tea was amazing. Only thing was I jad the earl grey coffee cake and it tasted day old. Ive had it before and it was super fresh but the other day it tasted dry and old. The place is amazing and the staff is even more amazing. They just need to keep the freshness of the earl grey  coffee cake.
Four Barrel Coffee,"While beautifully designed, it’s quite pricey, has limited vegan selections and charges extra for plant-based / vegan milk.  On the plus side, there’s a lot of seating and they have plant-based / vegan milk in the area where you can get a lid, napkins, etc."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Updating my review. I still think the coffee is good here, and maybe I should only be rating this place on their coffee. I also think the space is kind of cool. But my biggest complaint is that they don't have Wi-Fi. Again, maybe a superficial thing to rate them on since they are a coffee place. But I think it's ridiculous for a coffee space that charges that much to be too cheap or whatever else their reason may be to not offer Wi-Fi."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Very nice ambiance at this location, with a very open floor plan. It does not feel crowded or overwhelming. The menu is a little pricey but employees are friendly and this is overall, a great spot to visit on a rainy day."
Four Barrel Coffee,"What a cool place. Delicious coffee, pleasant atmosphere, and super cool decor. Definitely stop at the pour over and espresso bar. Bradley gave us scent samples of freshly ground beans and helped us select the most tasty roast. It was a great experience and one of the highlights of our stay in San Francisco!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee served by exceptional souls. In today""s environment where there is so much discrimination, I loved their logo.."" We filter coffee not humans"". On a side note..was impressed by the courtesy and respect that one of the servers displayed to a poor homeless soul. She asked him "" Sir,  are you hungry? Can I serve you something to eat.""  This is what we all need to strive towards. Bravo!!!"
Four Barrel Coffee,This place has a steady flow of customers.   They make a good cup of coffee here.   I prefer them over Phils.  The service is quick and friendly.   Don't go far after ordering your coffee.   The batista knows who's cup is being brewed and will wave you over.   I also like sitting at the patio on a sunny day.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! But please get some more savoury food options! My Ethiopian pour over was delicious with a banana chocolate scone and the whole experience of discussing the various pour over coffees and waiting for my drink made me feel very posh."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Let me start by saying the coffee is delicious. I did not try any pastries but knowing this kind of coffee shop they're probably pretty good. I can't say that I particularly liked everything they did with the space in here, but it certainly had a very distinctive feeling and there were parts of the decor that I loved. The little 2-person tables on the side of the bar were really cozy despite the cavernous high ceilings, and they have cool animal-head-shaped bag/coat hooks right there by each table which was convenient! Lastly, look at that latte art. Isn't it beautiful?"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good beans, overpriced but it's a San Francisco coffee shop so what do you expect? As any sceney SF coffee shop the people watching here is good. The building is cool and art is great but why is decent coffee always so hyped and overpriced? Either way the espresso was great even if I tasted the handmade cup I was drinking out of as much or more than the espresso. I would give it more stars if it wasn't for the demonic symbolism everywhere. We get it, it's so cool to worship the devil. *Insert eye roll."
Four Barrel Coffee,"My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. Warm atmosphere. Spacious. Great spot to come alone to work or sit down with a friend. Slow bar, espresso bar, and everything in between. Highly recommend."
Four Barrel Coffee,Nice decor and affogato. Pleasant atmosphere.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Beautiful bar with a design with attention to the smallest details and a wide selection of good quality products.  Fast and friendly service but with slightly high costs.  I must say that I really fell in love with the aesthetics of this place, the music, the environment and the people inside.  I believe he respects the real life of ordinary people in a particular city like San Francisco.  Especially locals and locals meet here.  It is rare to find so many tourists.  The only flaw: my espresso was terrible and if an Italian says it's not a good espresso you can trust it"
Four Barrel Coffee,Nice place to hang out and grab some great coffee!
Four Barrel Coffee,"That was the best cafe cortado I’ve had in my life, and I had my share. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, tasty beans, what else do you need?"
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee is amazing and service was great. There’s a good amount of seating - it’s a nice place to work
Four Barrel Coffee,"Been coming here for 5 years and it is still the best coffee in the city. Our family on the East Coast demands we send them beans every year because they are so good! When it is fully open, very cool to watch the roasting in the back."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Went to this place by looking the reviews and had Mocha from this place. However I didn’t find the Mocha good, the chocolate shot was all settled in the bottom and not completely mixed. Will try another drink next time. Till then It will be average place for me."
Four Barrel Coffee,Love the ambiance Definitely worth coming for study sessions or just a casual coffee date or meet. Taste of the espresso is pretty decent would still come here if I’m locally around.  Love the service asked for a one and one and were willing to accommodate me for it. Would definitely add it to the menu it’s like a really good way to tell what type of drink would go well with coffee blends.  Overall definitely recommend coming here for the ambiance and kind service.
Four Barrel Coffee,This is a perfectly made cortado. Hands down the best coffee in town. The coffee is roasted daily and it makes all the difference. Rain shine or higher winds it does not matter because Four Barrel never disappoints.
Four Barrel Coffee,Affogato is a must try if you are in San Fransisco! A silky scoop of vanilla ice cream pair with the bitter strong flavor of freshly house roasted coffee is a treat you don't need to feel guilty about!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Welcoming open space, friendly staff, excellent coffee. But a downside and be forewarned: They do NOT have or offer wifi or even electric outlets."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I really liked my coffee. I ordered it with a mushroom, bacon quiche and it went fabulous with the brew. I also love the location. It's quite the spot and the outdoor seating is a nice touch. Coffee was scalding though so watch out."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love this place! Coffee is super fresh and just grounded. You can have some options for milk such as whole milk, oatmeal milk and almond milk. There are not much seats (maybe 30 seats or so) and no WiFi as long as I know but super lovely place!!!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love their pour over coffee bar and single origin selections. These baristas really know there stuff and if you want to treat yourself to the occasional $4-$5 cup of some good Joe, you've come to the right place. They have another counter that handles their espresso, drip coffee, and baked goods. Cheers!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Huge space but very under-utilized. Pretty good coffee but in general, experience was poor. No WiFi either, and it was raining outside. As a tourist, I was pretty much trapped for an hour - couldn't hail an Uber, couldn't flag a cab, couldn't walk anywhere else, couldn't seat because there were so few tables and chairs, and everywhere I stood felt like I was intruding or out of place."
Four Barrel Coffee,"In love with the look and vibes here at Four Barrel. Big bar for you to order when you walk into the shop. There's a smaller station off to the side and closer to the front for what seemed like pour overs. I got an iced latte and it was good, but kind of wish I got a pour over now.  You know I had to buy a bag of beans to bring back with me to LA too. If the coffee is good, I always try to grab a bag of beans as a souvenir. They have a pretty good selection of single-origin beans so check it out if you have a setup at home!"
Four Barrel Coffee,Great space with awesome patio. Very chill vibe with super knowledgeable baristas. The espresso was amazing and the iced coffee was insanely good. Seating inside is limited but very well setup. Killer shop!
Four Barrel Coffee,"I Saw this place in a TV show. So I traveled from Mexico, and they don’t disappoint me. It’s a great place. Great atmosphere inside. Hipster. You can watch all the ‘roasting’ process at the back. And the baking too… I love this place. The barista was nice. Great experience. I bought a lot of whole grain coffee to repeat this experience at home"
Four Barrel Coffee,This place is heaven for ☕ lovers. The Mocha is an absolute must have with excellent dark chocolate blended with coffee! Not a fan of the music though!
Four Barrel Coffee,"I took my coffee fanatic friend here, and he says it's the best coffee he's ever had, including fancy coffee shops in Seattle, NYC, London. I agree with him, and I've been to many of the best coffee shops in many major cities too. This is the place I keep coming back to."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good selection of coffee flavors, a great atmosphere. The only complaint I have is that the coffee is beyond too hot to drink."
Four Barrel Coffee,I think this is really good coffee! Service was really good also. Very trendy place. Could see this place being a regular place!
Four Barrel Coffee,Would I come back: Probably not - just cause there are so many different coffee shops around.  Value: Decent coffee but wasn't spectacular.  The Good: Balanced cup of coffee.  The Bad: The store closed early that day for a staff party. Just a one off I'm sure.  Bath/Rest/Wash-rooms: Didn't use.
Four Barrel Coffee,Honestly I don’t know how to rate a place with not enough seats available! The chocolate tastes good but I’m not sure about the experience
Four Barrel Coffee,"I loved the experience here. Breakfast with a pistachio blackberry croissant and freshly brewed, cappuccino. The coffee here has its own unique taste just because they make their own beans here in-house."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great cup of coffee . Service was friendly. Also had a nice outdoor bar setting to sit and have a cup. Lost one star because the price was a bit more than I feel it should have been. Especially for the size of coffee. Large was barely the size of a small at most all other coffee shops. All around a great place for a sit and relax coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. Their beans are roasted here, but also served in many other places in the city. I've just tried a macchiato with a guava & cream cheese 'pastelito' and they were amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,"- flat white: above average latte, beans had a rich, chocolate flavor - the latte art was so pretty - pretty spacious inside and had great vibes"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I will never understand places who keep the doors wide open on a cold day. Unfortunately I was too cold to enjoy my time here. I got an overpriced ($5) tiny cup of tea, but that’s SF for ya.  They do have tables indoor and outdoors, which is what I was looking for. Not a big coffee drinker, but the space is nice and calming."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Excellent coffee - I've had some really brilliant lattes here. Spacious place, nicely designed. Has some outdoor seating."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love, love this place. Great coffee and pastries! Their whole beans are also amazing, if you’re into brewing your own!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Amazing coffee ... One of the best coffee & coffee houses in San Francisco (hands down). Great ambiance, but seating can be limited as it is very popular."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good coffee, best I’ve had in the US ever. Compares well to London’s third wave coffee shops. Croissant was top notch."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I live in London. After every trip to the States I come home, have a flat white and shake off the bitter, scalding, nightmare that is the American coffee experience.  Four Barrel Coffee gives me hope for this country. Their coffee does not peel off layers of taste buds with every sip and the rough but elegant clay cup doesn't burn my fingers. I can taste the drink and admire the gentle, subdued, latte art.  You'll be able to buy hipster clay coffee cups, admire rather creepy  stuffed animal heads on the wall, or have a lovely piece of almond cake with your drink."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice shop.. however, they had a stand at the door, so customers weren’t allowed inside.  In terms of the coffee, it was too acidic and sour for my liking."
Four Barrel Coffee,Americano is not that special but atmosphere and the terrace are awesome! I am going to Latte too because I saw many people ordering Latte😊 There is No Wifi! …
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best coffee shops. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that knows their coffee. Espresso and pour over brews are always perfect."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Some of the best coffee I've had hands down, incredibly sweet staff, and an inviting, cozy atmosphere. I wish I lived nearby so I could come here all the time. A nice little oasis for someone who's been walking all day and needs a break for their feet and a pick-me-up to keep going."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I came here as part of Branson's Airbnb coffee tour and I loved the atmosphere where one gets to detach from the online world and immerse here with their friends, catching up over decent drip coffee served in a nostalgic diner mug. Coffee beans are sourced globally and are roasted on site. It was cool seeing the bean bags and machinery towards the back. Would love to visit Four Barrels Coffee again when I'm back in San Francisco in the Mission Area."
Four Barrel Coffee,Good coffee and interesting pastries. The place was filled on a Saturday even though they don’t have any outlets. They also do not provide wifi - this is all understandable and fine. Also on the expensive end of coffee shops but I’m beginning to realize that there are not many coffee shops in SF where a cup of coffee will come out to be less than $5…
Four Barrel Coffee,"I'm a huge fan of Four Barrel, the location, the neighborhood, and the experience here. Stop in for coffee if you're near."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The place is just wonderful for coffee lovers. Weekends are full of people but the service is still friendly and fast, thanks for feeding my hunger for a perfect cup! I have to mention the cups they use, the ceramic cups is over the top~"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee, and super kind server. We asked her about the different coffee beans, and she was kind enough answer all our questions!"
Four Barrel Coffee,I took a class which was cupping and tasting. It was a great opportunity to get coffee experience. I usually buy beans in this cafe. Beans are so fresh.
Four Barrel Coffee,"pretty okay coffee but nothing really spectacular. i ordered their most popular or signature drink but it wasn't that great. the ambience of the cafe is nice but it's a bustling atmosphere and I don't think it was worth the 20 minute wait to order plus 10 to get your overpriced drink. if you're not a real coffee fanatic who can taste the origin of the beans upon your first sip, don't waste your time. go get starbucks. your unused gift card is probably waiting for you."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Cappuccino is great, and bought the coffee beans. The latte art could be better, at least mine was not so beautiful…"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is a hip coffee Mecca. So glorious. They have giant roasters in the back, a slow coffee bar where you can smell different kinds/roasts of beans, a regular coffee bar. They also have a mural on their bathroom floor. It's beautiful. I could live here."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I waited here while my family went through the Stranger Things Experience (I'm not able to do that much standing). Very open, nice atmosphere. Hibiscus iced tea and chocolate croissant were delicious"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I have visited many specialty coffee places in many countries and I must say this is the best in the world. The coffee is the best, the café with it's roastery is really nice, the location fantastic, and the staff at the drip bar are extremely knowledgeable and willing to share"
Four Barrel Coffee,The coffee is great! I'd love to be able to get a larger size of the drip.
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best coffee in US! Cool place, nice people."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I like the friendly staff and fast service. As someone who doesn't like coffee, the latte was pretty decent and fragrant!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in SF. I love the coffee, they even have some gluten free baked goods, and the artwork creates a great atmosphere to relax and enjoy your coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,Specifically cafe and roastery. Coffee and pastries are good. The vibe is very energetic.
Four Barrel Coffee,"To summarize this review: The coffee is fine, the service was decent, but the lack of WiFi or outlets is what did it for me. Go to Manny's instead the have a really cool mission, a great space, decent coffee, with WiFi and outlets.  The Coffee was fine, not amazing but tolerable. To elaborate, the time I went I got a cappuccino and my friend got a pour over, My cappuccino was a bit under extracted and the milk was over steamed, though the temperature was good. The flavor profile was there and noticeable, despite the extraction issue, and clearly they have a decent amount of roasting experience and knowledge. They just need some more consistency considering their baristas or just better training for them, especially taking into account how seriously they take themselves.  The service was good they were friendly but not overly so, it was a quick interaction: transaction, coffee received, dishes returned, with not much more exchanged.  That said there were a few things that blew my mind, I have never seen a good coffee shop that allows dining in no have outlets or even WiFi! The fact that they are promoting indoor seating, with high quality tables and a nice outdoor seating area, with no way to charge a laptop or phone and no way to hop on the web to send some emails or even write this review. I'm the type of person to go to a coffee shop and sit for a 3-4 hours hours getting work done and getting multiple drinks as time passes and I don't think that I'm the only one. This being impossible, or at least impractical, here I would much rather go to Manny's down the street and will be doing so from now on."
Four Barrel Coffee,Absolutely love this coffee shop. The roasts are so delicious and the service is fast and friendly. Highly recommend
Four Barrel Coffee,Four Barrel Coffee is our favourite coffee place in SF.  Every time we visit we uber straight from the airport to Four Barrel Coffee.  It's all about priorities and this affogato hit the spot!
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best coffee shops. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that knows their coffee. Espresso and pour over brews are always perfect."
Four Barrel Coffee,A good place to try because it is a new experience. Not like every other coffee shop you’ve tried.
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee with cool mugs:) no wifi has restrooms!
Four Barrel Coffee,Always a must when you're in sf. I love their coffee. The atmosphere is DOPE and can i please reiterate how much i LOVE their coffee????
Four Barrel Coffee,"My girlfriend and I were big coffee fans, so we decided to check out this local coffee shop. Surprisingly, the coffee tastes wonderful here, and the staff is fantastic. Everything was fine, and we intended to return here eventually. A very excellent coffee shop with the greatest coffee in town! Strongly recommended!"
Four Barrel Coffee,I never really understood why FB baristas think they are the best but never smile. It’s like they hate it when a customer walks in or something?! But their other cafe The Mill they are great and very happy! Every time I walk into The Mill I’m greeted with a smile and we crack jokes. But here at FB smiling seems to not exist here and they are annoyed when some one orders. Prior to the pandemic I use to come to FB a few times a week. Sadly going here now isn’t what it use to be and they seem  annoyed that people come in. Even the clientele isn’t what it use to be. The Mill it’s like one big happy party there. Maybe it’s the hipsters at FB? When ever a businesses main clientele is majority hipster the place tends to become unwelcoming. If you don’t fit the look and culture they treat you like Leper. The customers here don’t even want to share a table with a stranger. At The Mill nobody has a problem with sharing tables and everyone is welcome. FB treats those who don’t fit the look as peasants. One barista asked be if I was in the military due to my short and clean cut haircut. I said I was for 11 years. He looked at me with disgust and said “Typical” I asked him what he meant by that and he responded with “Here’s your drink and I’m to busy to talk”. Then he ignored me the rest of my time here.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Four Barrel Coffee $4.50 Cortado, mmm mmm good."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great, strong coffee... comparable to Blue Bottle, but pricier. Nice big space. Good date spot."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee, baked goods and staff in a cozy artsy space. A real unique place for coffee and a chat."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Obscene portraits on the wall for no reason, how would a kid be affected walking in there with his family?"
Four Barrel Coffee,"The latte was very good, but the herbal tea was a little too rosemary-forward for my liking. Pleasant staff. Nice facility. Would get coffee here again."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Amazing coffee, chill vibe.  A little pricey, but solid quality."
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee and vegan donut were 100%! Nice place to sit and hang
Four Barrel Coffee,"Sometimes the music is way louder than is comfortable, so probably not the best place to study or chat with friends. Coffee and tea are both good. And the pastries are generally delicious."
Four Barrel Coffee,Super cool spot with plenty of room to hang out with friends for. Parking isn't the worst thing in SF. Iced coffee was amazing on its own.
Four Barrel Coffee,Turns out it is hard to get good coffee other than up and down Valencia. This place is really great. Not like a few other places. When you leave the city you appreciate this place and its ilk.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great, quick service in a really nice place. They have a pour-over station too... unfortunately for me it was lunch time for the batista so I didn't get a chance to have some."
Four Barrel Coffee,Unique atmosphere and great cappuccino!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Incredible coffee with an amazing atmosphere at this large location! There is public seating outside, so if it's nice, get out and enjoy your coffee! The interior is very spacious, with places to sit and relax. Be sure to go around the back of the bar, you can see the staff roasting the coffee - it's very cool to watch! Pro tip - ride your bike! There is a custom bike holder directly outside the shop."
Four Barrel Coffee,One of the best places for coffee I've ever been to!
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee in the bay area!  The smoothness and aroma definitely leave you wanting more. I love how their setting is very modern with a touch of vintage. There are a lot of options if you are looking for a place to buy good coffee beans nowhere else to be seen. This is a bike friendly place so feel free to bike here and park your bike right outside.
Four Barrel Coffee,Great place for coffee.. love their Cappuccino.
Four Barrel Coffee,Best coffee I have in San Francisco! Looking for a hipster cafe? Here it is!
Four Barrel Coffee,I love the aesthetics of the place and the coffe is good.  There's also outdoor seating.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Service and coffee were great, but we came at the time of deliveries and there was no where else to sit, so we kept having to get up and downbas they were loading in."
Four Barrel Coffee,Top shelf coffee from a premier roaster! I've been here many times and will continue to visit. Always molto delizioso!
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place was dead when I went, and I can see why. What’s the point of all that seating if you’re not gonna let people use your wifi to get some work done? Also, not a single outlet in sight, and uncomfortable chairs. It’s almost like they don’t want people to stay, just grab coffee and run. Oh and the cookie I had was really dry lol"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is a review for the beans they sell through their online store. I've only been to the SF cafe once in 2018, but I ordered beans from them on the strength of their reputation. And I have to say: *something is wrong*. I tried four or five different bags. Single origin, blends, decaf. The only one that was even palatable was Peel Sessions (sold under the De La Paz label). The rest *all* tasted of nothing. Well, if they tasted of anything, it was the greasy, fatty mouthfeel of coconut oil. I'm no expert and I can't explain this except to guess that maybe they weren't freshly roasted. Maybe the coffee just sits on a shelf and, when they get an order, they stamp on today's date and ship it out. Really, for the money, and compared with other Bay Area roasters like Chromatic, Sightglass, Timeless etc, they are trash."
Four Barrel Coffee,"""Hi BPM.  Thank you for the feedback.  It's unfortunate that you haven't been able to find a coffee of ours that you like.  We constantly roast our beans fresh, always send out our freshest beans, and definitely stand by our coffee.  We would love to find a coffee that you love based on your current preferences, and also we would love to send over brewing instructions that might help your coffee taste even better!  Reach out anytime to orders@fourbarrelcoffee.com and we would be happy to help."""
Four Barrel Coffee,"I was gonna drag this place for being one of the driving forces of gentrification, but that’s not necessarily their fault. The staff are cool, the coffee is fine, and in typical neo-Mission fashion, it’s all overpriced.  Have a chat with the baristas, they’re all cool people who usually know their stuff if you’re into that. They’ve got a good selection of coffee, and it always smells great inside."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great cafe place. Ordered latte, it tastes soft but not creamy. Highly recommended!"
Four Barrel Coffee,Intense attention to detail! The coffee is phenomenal! The ceramic cups are gorgeous and earthy. They have classes if you want to learn even more about coffee and their specifics. Great location to work and enjoy the aroma and taste of lovely coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Just came in from out of town for the week and wanted to try something local instead of Starbucks which I have back home. The two meals I had were great, my cappuccino was so smooth and flavorful, and the staff were extremely friendly. Definitely will be coming back the next two days before I go back to Florida!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I've never been a huge fan of coffee (I drink Folger's a lot at home), but I randomly stumbled across this place while walking around in the Mission District. As a coffee newbie, it's pretty easy for me to say that any particular cup of coffee is good, but the coffee I had here really amazed and surprised me.  Right after I stepped foot into this coffee shop, I was pretty amazed by how minimal yet captivating the store was. It seems like the owner of the shop chose to maximize open space, because while the store itself is pretty large, there isn't much seating available. I found this design very interesting, and a stark contrast to many other places in San Francisco.  They have two counters - one counter sells coffee equipment for use in your home, and the other counter is where you order your drinks. At the back of the store, they have some large machinery (I presume to brew or roast the coffee but I might be wrong) and I found that really interesting.  As for the coffee itself, they have a very simple menu with about 7 items. I got the mocha and my friend got the house blend. The coffee was served in some pretty cool clay cups. Definitely the best coffee/mocha that I've ever had.  I would definitely recommend visiting this place!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is one of the most well known local hipster coffee places. There are always lots of people here, but the line moves fast. If people linger, they are conversing, or reading. There is outdoor seating too. Great place to randomly encounter neighbors. The coffee is delicious, and strong. They roast it in the back. One bathroom always has a line."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love the atmosphere - open airy with lots of exposed wooden beams. It's a total hipster Mission joint with growing-in-popularity pour-over coffee. The coffee is great quality for those who like treating coffee like fine wine. Note that if you've never had pour-over coffee, it takes a while but at least you know it's freshly brewed. I don't recommend this though if you are in a rush and just want a quick caffeine fix. The lines can move pretty slowly... I haven't tried the pastries yet, but they look amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I’m not exactly sure why, but Four Barrel is the best and most consistent coffee shop in SF, a touch better than standouts like Sight Glass, quite a bit better than beloved chain Ritual, and several streets ahead of Reveille and their ilk. It’s their espresso. Meeky freeky it’s fantastic. To quote Tina Turner, it’s simply the best."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I have been a big fan of Four Barrel's coffee since I first moved to SF four years ago. I think it's possibly the best coffee being roasted in the city. It's a little on the pricey side, so I save it for special occasions when I intend on getting a pour over or a nice latte. It's a very popular spot, so it's often crowded, and seating can be very limited. There is a nice parklet out front for those warmer, sunny Mission days."
Four Barrel Coffee,"When I first came to San Francisco, I spent a lot of time trying different coffee shops in search of my definitive favorite coffee shop. For a long time, it was Four Barrel. Not that they aren't a great coffee shop, but what I've realized is that all of the coffee shops in San Francisco have things they're really good at. Four Barrel's strengths are its drip coffees and beans. While I enjoy their lattes, cappuccinos, and the like very much, they aren't as good as those of some of the other coffee shops in the city. Definitely come here for their drip coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Very fashionable coffee store, and flavor is rich."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Still my favorite! Great coffee, great vibe‼️"
Four Barrel Coffee,Delicious coffee in a larger warehouse like room.  Fun for a group to go and chat over coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,Absolutely gorgeous venue. This might sound weird but I think they have the most beautiful bathroom I've seen at a coffee store. Coffee is quite good but not my favorite tho. Not all espressos are perfectly poured so you don't always get the same quality. However this is me being super picky. Place is great. They also have a tasting bar for different beans.
Four Barrel Coffee,Beautiful coffee place and the coffee is everything you expect on a good espresso and cappuccino
Four Barrel Coffee,Not a good place to work (no plugs no wifi) Good americano
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee. The brew coffee taste like a pour over. Really good atmosphere at this place. Lots of unique art in the wall. Interior is wood and metal and cement kinda design. Could see myself going there often if I lived is SF.
Four Barrel Coffee,"The best coffee I've ever tasted, period. I ordered a V60 and it was just wonderful, the barista helped me a lot a with my beans choice and his advice was more than helpful. Also the coffee roaster was very gentle and he took 10 minutes of his time to explain me the how the whole process worked, super nice human being!  It was more like an experience rather than just a coffee shop."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Cute place with super nice staff! Typically priced for SF. No outlets and no WiFi is kind of a bummer, but I get that they don't really want people spending a lot of time there. The openness is a cool vibe but allows for ambient noise to echo. Great to do some work for maybe an hour, but otherwise (as the place is clearly designed to provide a structural incentive to do) you may not hang around for too long."
Four Barrel Coffee,"A local favorite, even more know that it’s employee owned. I Sunday’s I grab the iced coffee but this evening I had the hot chocolate. Just what I needed for a rainy day."
Four Barrel Coffee,"They roast their own beans in the back area of the shop.  One of my favorite coffee places in SF. A separate pour over bar, a dozen varieties of beans for sale, outdoor seating (since the indoor seating is invariably occupied), and excellent pastries. The coffee and espresso are great.  The place is very cool Mission lumberjack hipster, if you can't handle that."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The coffee and desserts at this place are amazing!  I haven't been in this city very long, but an average price of only $3 seems like excellent value to me.  Admittedly, the indoor seating is neither conducive to a social or work environment, but I'm still very much a fan of the industrial / modern vibe going on.  I was particularly intrigued by the giant coffee bean machine that they had in that back where you could actively see people working.  I'd definitely return here with friends and perhaps take a shot at the outdoor seating."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Best coffee place! Tons of bike parking outside, a good amount of space inside for the line to accumulate (and it can) and the coffee is roasted literally feet from where it's brewed. It doesn't get any better than that. I adored my mocha which was the perfect drinking temperature. I also treated myself to a fantastic chocolate croissant. Highly recommend taking the coffee roasting tour as well where you'll learn how the coffee is roasted and the importance of the process to developing flavor in the coffee. Amazing coffee place and would recommend it to anyone for an authentic San Francisco experience. Also, I really appreciate the relationship that Four Barrel builds with it's farmers. Bonus."
Four Barrel Coffee,This is my favorite SF coffee shop. I started coming here after trying many other shops 3 years ago. It’s great because I can get a good run from my hotel down to the shop and back. The folks that run the place are nice as you would expect and the coffee is awesome. Typically I roll with a cappuccino that is always perfect. Thanks Four Barrel!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Exceptional service. Food is also decent, but coffee is very good"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I have been a fan of Fourbarrel since it opened. The coffee is excellent as are the pastries. They have classes and brewing supplies and more, all in an open and fun space. It has a bit of a hipster feel but not in an oppressive way.  It's a great place for visitors to get a feel for the Mission."
Four Barrel Coffee,Four Barrel is an SF staple for me. Good atmosphere and good coffee. They have a quick bar for walk up customers and a slow bar for those who want to take their coffee a bit more seriously. Is it the best coffee I have ever had? No. Have I ever been disappointed? Never!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Incredible! They have a giant coffee roaster and teach classes here. I had a hot chocolate. It was rich, tasty, and perfectly prepared. There is lots of seating. They play records on a phonograph and blast the music which makes conversation difficult. They don't like being asked to turn it down."
Four Barrel Coffee,Very goos roastery and coffee with good selection and cool atmosphere!
Four Barrel Coffee,The coffee beans are brewed by themselves. The coffee is served in earthen ware. Very different experience. And definitely a very pleasing one
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great fitout, coffee, pastries, people. No WiFi."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Really well made and good coffee, and they clearly have a monopoly, but quite pricey at nearly $7 a cup."
Four Barrel Coffee,I went here looking for great coffee and espresso. I got an iced coffee with a shot of a espresso on the side. The coffee was all exceptional. The person I went with got a latte and was incredibly impressed. The service is where it falls short. I felt like I was an annoyance. The cashier seemed to just want me to order and leave. There's a crowd here and if you don't blend it seems they want you out.  Tldr amazing coffee but iffy service
Four Barrel Coffee,Enjoyed an expert pour over coffee tasting at four barrel coffee which was excellently done. Tasting led me to discover novel tastes notes in the coffee from dark chocolate over oranges to apples. The explanation from picking the beans over roasting to pouring was amazing and well-described. Beyond just the coffee this is a great and nicely designed cozy space to hangout in mission. Hope to come back there soon.
Four Barrel Coffee,"What a good place to start sf trip. I ordered a regular drip coffee and i have to say ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" according to yelp rating system. It got all the right elements of a solid coffee. It was bold, nice aroma, little bit of bright acidity, and mostly complex in flavor. I would love to try their espresso drinks next time."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I've visited SanFran once a few years back and was told this was the spot to hit for great coffee, and it was great.   Ever since that time I had been looking forward to returning, lucky for me in Dec. 2019 I got a chance to re-visit this coffee shop and bring a handful of production crew along with me.  Four Barrel Coffee did an excellent job on all the coffee ordered and was attentive and patient to even the most quirkiest individuals that I brought along.  Thank you, and I look forward to my next visit - to San Fran AND to Four Barrel Coffee!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great place with great coffee. I had latte and drip coffee, both were good. By the time I went there they didn’t have pour over available."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The staff here are super friendly and the atmosphere is great. I love the separate, drip coffee bar. The arrangement of where the cream and sugar are and where the line is to get coffee could be rethought. It turns into a bit of a clustered mess when you're waiting for your coffee and standing in everyone's way, but honestly, that's just nitpicking. Overall, I love this place."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I was in the neighborhood looking for work space. Not really a coffee drinker...I ordered their hot chocolate which was so velvety,thick and rich...just the rightness sweetness from the cocoa bean itself.  Ample community working tables. Not all spots have plugs.  Music was a little loud so don't plan on taking calls here."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Extraordinary coffee experience! From drip coffee to espresso drinks with the homemade almond milk or the incredible fresh milk, all are excellent!  And by far, the most precious part of the coffee shop is the slow bar.  If you are serious about your coffee spend some time there, well worth it! 😁 …"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place makes for a great coffee drinking experience! It has a decent amount of seating and standing space for a coffee shop, but it's safe to assume that it will be packed when you come. You can check out their roasting and extraction process in the back while you wait though."
Four Barrel Coffee,Four barrel is one of the first third wave coffee shops In sf and still stays true to its roots. The interior is very eclectic and I especially love the custom machines they have on display. Coffee is great albeit often a bit bitter so make sure you order the right type of espresso concoction. They serve excellent pastries and pour over coffee as well.
Four Barrel Coffee,I really liked! They have very good coffee! And the pastries are so yummy. The cheesecake pumpkin muffin is awesome! Soooo good! Loved it! The staff is young and friendly. There's also outside seating. Dogs are allowed inside (even big ones). The bathroom floor mural is amazing:) And I liked the interior! It's one of San Fran's many unique coffee places!
Four Barrel Coffee,Iced coffee with cashew milk tastes a bit sour and the milk was splitting. White chocolate chip cookie was tiny.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Beautiful location with exposed wood beams and wooden tables. Espresso was 4/5, a little more bitter than to my taste, but with bright acidity and floral notes. Prices are average for SF coffee shops and the place sells a wide variety of single origin beans roasted in house."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I had not had nitro coffee before this. The flavor is just as strong as black but with a velvety silksmooth texture. The place is wide open. The people were cool. Good coffee, and good vibes, and a nice place to enjoy it are all I'm looking for in this life. No photos. Being present. 🕉️ …"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee and atmosphere, must try it when you visit SFO."
Four Barrel Coffee,"4B is a nice coffee shop, but I don't think it's worth the huge lines to order. The decor and layout are really cute, and they have cute standing tables outside. The coffee is good, and they have a VERY limited pastries menu.  On a separate note the place is ALWAYS packed, and it's hard to find a table (let alone the +10 minute wait time to order).  In summary, I don't get what the fuss is about."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Very nice coffee, relaxed atmosphere. Try to sit at the counter in the back with a view to the roastery."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Try the lemon thyme donut and thank me later. Wait. That's not all - I can with all honesty recommend just about everything on the menu because I had the great pleasure of staying at my friend's house who lives across the street from this place. The atmosphere is very cool: warehouse style, walls draped with artistic local photos, and bike friendly as witness to the gang of fixed gears outside the front door.  Now to the coffee. The coffee is divine. Rich. Bold. Smooth. It reminds me of when I went to a coffee plantation in Costa Rica. I don't think I ever had as good of coffee until I went to Four Barrel. My favorite is the latte with almond milk, which is a healthier alternative to soy or skim, but hey you won't be able to tell.  Truth be told if you are a fan of good coffee this is the best in the city. This place rocks."
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee was okay there is better in the area.  I have only been to it once while visiting San Francisco.  Coffee is very subjective and could have just been the what they had  drip brewed that day was not my preference.  I will say the shop itself is very interesting. The 3 stars based purely on fact I did not like coffee.  I will try it again in the future and maybe my opinion will change.
Four Barrel Coffee,One of my favorite coffee shops ever. The design of this place is mind-blowing and they serve high quality coffee. There is no wifi however or electric outlets. I think they want people to enjoy their coffee and avoid them sticking around. Must try in San Francisco!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great and unique third wave roaster. If you have 10 minutes go to the slow bar (pour over and espresso) and hopefully Bradley is working the bar. He was very patient, giving and informative about all the beans available and took you through the process step by step. Everytime I go there I learn something new, excellent service and amazing coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Just made my third trip here in as many years... The coffee's great, the cakes are yummy and the look of the place (with the boar heads on the wall) is pretty funky. You can sit outside if the weather's nice or inside if you can find a seat - at the back, you can watch the beans being ground too. The staff are a little too cool for school so don't expect a cheery hello with your caffeine."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Four Barrel has great coffee and is located in a great space in the Mission. It's large and roomy, featuring long communal tables and smaller ones as well. It has an open plan so you can see their coffee roasting equipment, which is cool. They also serve fresh pastries from a local bakery that are fantastic. My main beef with this place is the lack of WiFi. Like, why not? Super annoying when I want to go there to get work done."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Went for the first time yesterday... its a swanky place with good outdoor seating - perfect for a warm day in the mission.  Its huge, loud and full of energy inside.  The coffee, like Ritual, was just the right temperature and delicious.  Only reason for a 2/3 for food is the lack of skim milk for my coffee!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"A very big space with a rustic wood feel. Lots of interesting art on the walls. I'm in love with their bathroom- gorgeous wallpaper and a huge chandelier. I ordered a cappuccino and was prepared to be disappointed when I saw the barista didn't tamp properly, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it actually is."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is honestly my favorite coffee place in SF! The espresso is extremely tasty and of high quality. If you have the time, you should definitely try out the drip coffee bar where they always offer high quality single origin South American coffee. Only drawbacks I can see are one it's very popular so it's always difficult to find a place to sit and two they don't have wifi.  Overall, a must for anyone in SF."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great selection of coffee.  Nice wooden tables in a fairly large pleasant space.  Interesting art on the walls.  Excellent array of pastries.  Some outdoor seating on a busy street.
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place does not have enough tables for people to sit or even stand at. My friend and I drank our coffee feeling too overcrowded and intruding on the random tea bar pushed off to the side. The bathroom is also a bit claustrophobic even with the high ceiling.  The coffee was good though, sure helped me on the drive back home. And the music they were playing, off of vinyl, was great. A true hipster paradise."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Located in hipster neighborhood of the Mission. It's a large cafe with ample natural lighting and space to work or meet friends over coffee. They have a special coffee bar on the side that does special type of coffee brewing. I didn't get a chance to check out what it is. But fun place overall. Their coffee is more acidic than I like. So if you prefer that type of coffee than, this is the place for you."
Four Barrel Coffee,"When I come here , it kind of reminds me of choc full of nuts in Manhattan. The quality of the Java Bean as well as the pastries are amazing. I absolutely love this coffee shop. It's a nice getaway when you need time out."
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. There's great coffee and tea, almond milk and plenty of seating. Since their coffee is so good, it tends to be pretty busy but that's understandable. It's great for grabbing a quick coffee to go, meeting with friends or just sitting down for a little bit to enjoy your drink. If you're looking for a coffee shop to work in, this one might not be the best choice. There's plenty of seating but since it's so crowded at times it's not necessarily an easy place to work when you need to focus.  Love this place!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Always makes the best pour over and espresso in San Francisco. I prefer the location on Burrows because I can stop on my way to work every day without a long line. They never over roast, their free cupping events are nice, and staff is nice (yet still trying too hard to be hipsterrific). Recommended."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The definition of a hipster coffee joint. I feel like four barrel is THE go to place for many people in the mission and the city for that matter. You can tell by how reviewed this place is.  I've had the coffee, cappuccino and latte. The coffee is meh and too bitter for my liking but the latte and cappuccino make it up with their excellence. They're both of the right strength and texture so definitely check them out. A downside is the price and the serving size but that's what you get for being such a popular destination for coffee lovers."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great ambiance and decoration - average coffee  Tried this place out - ordered an earl grey strawberry donut pastry, a hot coffee, and a cold brew to go. And the pastry was the best part of my order (something that probably doesn't bode well for a coffee shop).  The cold brew was extremely watered down - I was basically drinking water. They combine a small, small cup with way too much ice, so I was basically drinking 10% coffee, 60% ice and 30% water.  When you combine that with the fact that the place doesn't have WiFi, this place is a solid three-stars. I haven't tried their slow-brew coffee (at this small station on the left after you walk in), so I'll probably return some time for that. Other than that, I wouldn't really recommend this place."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee shop with a small selection of drinks and great service. Try the pistachio blackberry scone.
Four Barrel Coffee,The cortado and cappuccino were so good! Great atmosphere.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I’ve personally been going to this location since it opened. I really love their coffee and concept. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Additionally, i love how they purchase their beans direct from growers, pay the growers beyond “fair trade” wages, roast their beans inhouse on a manual roaster, don’t burn the beans during the roasting process, and so many other interesting facts i learned on one of the tours i attended when i worked at a restaurant who used Fourbarrel coffee beans. They were also great about coming out to teach the restaurant staff how to properly serve French press."
Four Barrel Coffee,NOT open on Xmas  Otherwise I love the vibe here. Pull up a window seat and watch the wildness of the Mission pass by 💫 …
Four Barrel Coffee,"Ahead of the game in connecting discerning coffee drinkers directly to growers around the world. Fine and unusual brewed coffee and perfect espresso drinks, excellent pastry selection, and roasting happening right on premises. There's always a few folks camped with laptops but this place is meant for a quick drink and chat with a friend, not hours of email."
Four Barrel Coffee,"First word that comes to mind.... TRENDY. There is no such thing as single file here. Most customers tend to stand right in front of the cashier while they wait for their drinks because they have no where else to go and are clueless as to what's exactly happening inside Four Barrel.  The space is beautiful and the fact that they have a barista posing as a deejay and spinning fat coffee shop beats on vinyl is pretty unique and unequivocally Mission. There is even an espresso tasting counter to the left upon entrance. Four Barrel is a sight to see for sure. Just be forewarned about the line... or lack thereof. Don't spend all of your precious time waiting for a drink that will never come if you have yet to order. Ask questions - ""Are you in line?"" ""no"" and move on to the front.  The staff, although well trained seem to be as clueless as the customer base with a lackadaisical approach to serving your coffee or taking your order. I give it FOUR stars for it's hipster approach to keeping with the current city trend in beans.  One word... Trendy."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I guess I had somewhat high expectations for Four Barrel. I wasn't quite as impressed as I am with other local SF coffee spots. It could have been the brew, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. However, I am a fan of the pure taste of coffee, and definitely respect that they serve drip coffee!  I will also give proper credit for their interior, it made my visit worthwhile!"
Four Barrel Coffee,The best coffee shop in SFO. Here's really nice. Also taste is really good!!!
Four Barrel Coffee,Always clean.. first come first served here.. Get your pastry early before is sold to someone else lol. The coffee size is small to medium..but more small.  No there are no other sizes.. That's the biggest down fall .. a 4-5 dollar drink but minus the regular larger size.. I absolutely love the door and the high ceiling.. I can say that being almost seven feet tall lol Good clearance is hard to find nowadays.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Walked around all day to find a good coffee place and was super hyped to find not only real cups, but a freakin' roastery in the back? i love the vibe and am super happy to have this option close to me."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Service here is unparalleled – everyone is so thoughtful and friendly. The coffee is obviously delicious, but they also have the best blackberry pistachio croissant I’ve ever had."
Four Barrel Coffee,It has the best iced latte in San Francisco!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great local-hip coffee roaster in the Mission district. Smooth, flavorful slow bar options. Delicious Blackberry Pistachio Croissant, among other solid baked goods. Love that they offer Affogato as well."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Well, I love coffee, and being in a place where you can see live roasting while having a great cup of filtered specialty one is close to the perfect experience. Also liked a lot the kindness of the personnell and the wooden interiors. Finally, how not noticing the bike parking mounted in the front? Perfect"
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of my favorite coffee spots in SF. They have lots of seating inside, as well as some bar seating that looks out the window onto action packed Valencia. Or even better a parklet outside with bar seats to let you watch the world go by. Their slow bar is my favorite as the barista loves to talk with you about the different coffees they have available, his passion is amazing!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice ambiance but very uncomfortable chairs, no wifi, no plugs, meh coffee. Definitely not a place to work."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Fourbarrel has some of the best coffee in the city!  Their coffee beans are always freshly roasted and I inevitably take home a few bogs every time I am there.  The line is out the door and grabbing a table is less than easy, but the cafe has a cool feel to it with roasting happening in the back and a great little patio out front.  A must try for coffee lovers."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I only had a decaf espresso here, but still have some thoughts. The coffee itself was bad (but again, decaf). The space is interesting conceptually, but overdone by trying too hard with the art and decor. Music was loud and annoying. The pastries didn't look particularly tempting either (and I was ready to be tempted). Lastly, the espresso cup didn't have a handle, which looked great, but was entirely impractical. Overall, I'd say 4B is overrated – there are far better places for coffee in the city."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Looking for the nearest popular coffee shop, my friend and I stumbled upon Four Barrel Coffee. The ambiance and positive vibes were quite nice in this spacious coffee shop, as you can see people either working on their laptops peacefully or catching up with a friend, even as late as 7:00PM. However, like many other reviewers have stated, this place is definitely packed despite the large amount of space it offers - almost every table and stool was occupied and we kind of had to stand around until a spot opened up. For a nice coffee fix, my friend and I ordered two lattes together. She ordered a regular latte while I got a Mocha Latte. The latte art was definitely on point at Four Barrel Coffee and we received similar designs with some minor differences. As for the quality of the drinks, they were delicious as well. However, being the sweettooth that I am, I definitely had to add more creamer and sugar in my coffee, hah. Overall, I would definitely recommend Four Barrel Coffee as one of the nicest coffee shops to visit if you're ever visiting San Francisco."
Four Barrel Coffee,"They have great coffee and a selection of both half-and-half and almond milk to mix. The pastries that they offer are fun, tasty, and creative. I like that their drinks aren't overly sweetened. Good coffee shouldn't be covered up with sugar."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Damn good dairy free mocha. Expensive but worth it.  Update: when they're great they're great, but the last couple of times I went the mochas were thin tasting, because the Chocolate had not been well mixed, so they were sweet and heavy at the end, watery on the top.  Not awesome when it's 8 dollars a cup, often with a long wait"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Much less snob than other nearby cafe spots, the coffee is delicious, maybe too acidic and strong for some people, but if you can't stand strong coffee, you can always ask for a latte or mocha; both are very good, and they have almond milk with no aftertaste! The place is always crowded, but the line moves fast."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great atmosphere, really cool art and delicious coffee!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"What a cute coffee shop! Not only is it cute but it has lots of space for people to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee. They also have an amazing selection of coffee and truely know their product. I also loved the decor, overall just a great experience."
Four Barrel Coffee,"It's pretty awesome watching the whole coffee production in the back. Their coffee is a bit more expensive than at some of the other local places, but for beans they have more variety. However, some of the beans were roasted a week prior, so you need to check the dates. I did manage to get a bag roasted from the day prior, so it was super fresh.  They have b patisserie kouign amanns here, so if you don't want to go all the way up to pac heights, it's convenient for that.  Their chocolate banana scone is not bad - not too sweet, and I like interesting scone flavors.  The park let and bike racks out front are a nice touch. No wifi."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The place looks good but I’ll never go back, not for the coffee (world’s bitterest almond latte) nor for the attitude. Oh yeah - has the business been moved into the hands of the employees as was promised in 2018 after 8 employees filed sexual harassment suits? I’m guessing not since they also decided not to change the name. Not a business to support."
Four Barrel Coffee,"When you look this place up on Yelp or Foursquare, some key words are ""hipster,"" ""good value,"" and ""clean."" All of which, are true.  I really liked the layout, it's very spacious and has a public seating area in the front. The price for the coffee is well worth it, and the cleanliness is astonishing based on how many people seem to go through in a given day (long lines still at 5pm in the afternoon).  However, it is obvious they dont want people camping out for long periods of time, as there are no outlets and no wifi available. So come with a fully charged laptop and a set of headphones because the place is loud. Or just come with friends and have a nice chat over a cup of coffee :)"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I love the coffee and ambiance of Four Barrel. I noticed that the crowd were either real coffee drinkers or hipsters who just wanted to hang out and enjoy the beats. The parking is a challenge, but the coffee is extraordinary. This Cafe is a must visit."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I'm personally not the biggest fan of Four Barrel Coffee, but in this case, there can be more to a coffee shop than just the coffee...  1. there is no better people watching in the City. 2. the place is comfortable inside with a great parklet outside 3. no matter what you feel about their coffee, the folks working there will find you something to drink 4. did I mention the people watching? 5. good eats in the pastry case 6. sitting along the back counter where they roast and pack their beans is endlessly interesting  Just go!"
Four Barrel Coffee,This is an awesome coffee shop. Great wooden design inside and out that is unique looking given it's middle-of-SF location. Their espresso is probably some of the best I've had. I'm always sure to get at least a cappuccino anytime I'm in the city.
Four Barrel Coffee,"My #1 cafe in San Francisco. Spacious, vibrant place with a great atmosphere. Open back space underlines the atmosphere and let people to adore exposed roastware. The service and barista's craft was flawless"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Anchoring the new wave of hipster takeover in the Valencia area of the Mission, Fourbarrel is an excellent place for more than just coffee, but an excellent atmosphere with a good, art, music and style oriented community. Come enjoy a perfectly brewed espresso for relatively good value and have a seat. The decor is mostly bare, but it gives off a very minimal, industrial vibe that allows one to focus more on the coffee. The back of the establishment is the brewing portion of the cafe itself which makes sitting in the cafe more interesting as you can see the beans crushed just yards away. Come once, come often."
Four Barrel Coffee,"First! This places just looks so cool! It's very industrial and it will make you look down on every Peets and Starbucks from then on, Forever!  The decor is something out of Houzz.  The coffee is freshly made and my cappuccino came with a heart in it!!  I definitely did not expect that and it was so cool to see! The staff is very hip, young, and friendly.  The pastries are also very tasty so you can't go wrong there.  This is easily the coolest coffee shop I've been to with the best tasting coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Very hipster ambience and atmosphere -in a good way- and I had a latte, which was pretty damn good. However, there is no wifi, which is a bit silly. They play all their music off of records, which is simultaneously awesome and hilarious. Dope and very San Francisco."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Some of the very best coffee in town. Is there any better? This cafe is quite nice too- it's comfortable, and they serve decent pastries and small bites (if a bit pricey...)  Prices on whole bean coffee are very good for this level of excellence."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee was really good. The service was not the best, but maybe I caught them on an off day. Still worth a visit, especially to checkout the gorgeous Probat in the back. No WiFi for those looking for working space, but reception was fine so you can hotspot. The layout was really nice, sans an awkward order/pick up layout."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This establishment was embroiled in a very controversial sex and harassment scandal and wholesale accounts across the country dropped this business. There are so many exceptional cafes and great baristas in San Francisco. I have no desire to take my business to an establishment that fails to follow through on their public promises. Ritual, Verve, etc are nearby if you need to give your business to a large coffee company. Otherwise throw your weight behind smaller local roasters and cafes."
Four Barrel Coffee,I come here at least once a week since I live down the street. They have the second best lattes I've ever had.. and some pretty darn good pastries. They're always switching it up though so it depends on the day. One time I had an earl grey/strawberry donut.. pretty awesome!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Continuously produces some of the best coffee I've ever had. I enjoy process at the slow bar more than the espresso; they usually have at least one excellent fruity coffee. No Wi-Fi, so not an easy place to work from for the day."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Excellent affogato made with care. The place has a nice ambience, feels rustic with wooden beams and best thing is seeing them roast the beans in old school roasting barrels. My favourite espresso spot in San Francisco!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Sure, the coffee is really good. But be prepared to dust off a thick coat of fisherman-chic barista-hipster soot from the lid. And yes - now they serve tea, so you'll only get an ear bitten off rather than your entire head."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I went to this gem in the Mission on a G+ event and I have to say that the guys working here really are passionate about coffee. The passion and intellect that goes into their coffee is unparalleled.  They carefully select their beans directly from the growers all over the world, there is no middle man.  The chemist, as I like to call him, taught me more about coffee in an hour than the 20 years or so I have been drinking coffee and I thought I knew a lot about coffee.  Everyone there is very friendly, and of course the coffee is magnificent.  Their knowledge of coffee is like going into a wine store and asking about different wines.  Oh they also have coffee classes. If you like coffee at all or are just interested in learning more about coffee, I would highly suggest signing up for one."
Four Barrel Coffee,My favorite part of this place is the sun. You can sit down for work all day and not feel trapped! Can only comment on the pastry I had — solid.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Delicious coffee, I like to get the pour over, but really anything is great. If you can get a seat, it is a fun place to hang out. Otherwise, there's always the parklet outside (with cool hanging bike racks)."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Often a long line but the pour over bar to the left as you walk in is usually faster. Super tasty coffee, the only place I drink it black. There was a ton of controversy about Four Barrel a few months back regarding sexual harrassment from the owners, but it's an employee owned co-op now and I'm ready to give them a second chance"
Four Barrel Coffee,The staffs are friendly and they made you feel welcome and their services was excellent too. I love how they perfectly made their coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,I'm sitting here drinking the best Americano I ever had! Four Barrel is a close walk to where I am staying in San Fran it lived up to the hype. It has a wonderful old school vibe with a record player and wooden furniture. The staff are really friendly as well. I just spent 5 mins talking hoops with one. Stop by if you can!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Definitely loved this cafe and one of my favorite by far! The setting and ambiance of the cafe gives off the same feel as Sighglass Coffee and they had a unique 'parking lot' for the hipster bicycle people outside the cafe. Their macchiato with almond milk is definitely something to try; it had a good mix of strong coffee taste but sweet after taste from the almond milk to complement each other. Although there is no Wifi or outlet, it's a sweet place to take a couple hours of out of your day to relax and read. You will definitely get the SF cafe experience by coming here and you won't be disappointed. The pricing of the coffee here is also not too overpriced so always a plus! :)"
Four Barrel Coffee,Good place to socialize in the afternoon. Nice coffee and woodwork.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Chic newish cafe with downtown  aspirations. No options in house coffee roasts a problem, but is compensated by finely done specialty blends for the foam and air technology set that crawl in with fashionably disheveled hair. Pricey pastries shine. Interior is urban and warm."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I know this place is very popular and gets high ratings (4.5 average) but for me the experience is okay.  The price of the drinks is expensive and the coffee in and of itself is so bitter to me.  We've had a tradition of grabbing morning coffee while we wait for our brunch reservation nearby, and whether I get a pour over, nitro brew or drip coffee... They all have a decidedly bitter taste that's overwhelming."
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best tasting coffees next to Equator coffee. Buttery tasting rich mochas, cold brew, drip coffee; you name it, it's great here. Not alot of seating if you are coming with several friends. Busy times to avoid are Sunday/Saturday mornings around 10am. Best to come early or later in the day."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place deserves every ounce of it's accolades!  I'm a huge coffee snob and a service industry veteran and I can tell you the employees here excel in every category, not the least of which is PASSION. They love what they are doing and it's apparent.  While you are becoming intoxicated by the incredible aromas generated by they're amazing coffee, you are being told a story about the man who grew the beans!  Now, I can't  recommend that you go during crazy busy times but, just know, there is a very good reason they are busy.  GO. Enjoy the coffee, the pastries and the service. You'll be back."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great decor, friendly and hipster vibe, but no WiFi or PowerPoints to plug into so my plans to stay all day were thwarted. Also, they’d advertised almond and cashew milk on their board but served my latte w some almond/oak mixture, which to be perfectly honest, was **awful**. I couldn’t finish it. That being said, the vegan donut was really nice. I’d probably come again, but only order a black coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great place to read books, either print or tablet. No wifi, easy to chat up with your friends and relative. Ultra yummy pastries. As for the coffee, they all got diversities of taste, never the same and always delicious and smooth. Worth every pennies and worth my time."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I’ve owned my own coffee shop so I am pretty particular about my espresso; the Barista pulled my shots, chatted with us a bit, then steamed my milk....my shots sat there way too long before being combined with the milk, which affected the flavor 😔 Great atmosphere, friendly employees. Just didn’t meet my high standards when it comes to making sure my shots don’t expire."
Four Barrel Coffee,Iconic fixture on Valencia. Nice to sit outside on a warm day (if you're lucky enough to get one in SF). The pistachio blackberry croissant was the best I've ever had!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Dinosaur Coffee in LA serves Fourbarrel so I was excited to try the original! Delicious coffee in a wide open space with plenty of places to sit and get some work done, have a chat, or read by yourself. Great atmosphere and lines were not too bad."
Four Barrel Coffee,Supreme coffee roasters. Excellent espresso. Great atmosphere. Friendly service. The only negative is that baristas can be inconsistent (perhaps some are just inexperienced) compared to other big coffee names in the city.
Four Barrel Coffee,Great open space and awesome coffe. They dont have a good selection of desserts.
Four Barrel Coffee,Gorgeous space. They really take the time to make the coffee properly. My cortado was the perfect temp. Not burnt or too hot.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice spot for a coffe break. The food is really good but the offer not so wide (especially for lunch). It's not very big, so it's not always easy to find a seat, bet it worths the wait. The staff is really kind. Recommended."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice place for coffee, and the decor of this cafe is cool.  And you can they still using vinyl to play music. The coffee itself is good, just the choice is limited.  But it's a good place for relaxing"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good third wave coffee, milk texturing could have been better, friendly staff, very open space inside, sidewalk seating also"
Four Barrel Coffee,This place is flooding with awesome atmosphere. You feel cooler just being inside. It's always packed but no matter what the baristas will be extremely friendly and ask you how your day was. Since Fourbarrel roasts its own beans (in the back of the store no less) the coffee is top notch. Semi-sweet mochas and silky espresso make this coffeeshop a must-visit.
Four Barrel Coffee,"For taste and quality, Fourbarrel is hands down my favorite coffee in the city, outranking other local favorites like Blue Bottle and Ritual. The prices are on par with the rest of San Francisco coffee establishments ($4+ for a latte). The servers are, well, not exactly unfriendly, but they definitely have the San Francisco hipster air about them. Except with an arrogance that seems to convey that they were first to the trend.  The space is large enough, warehouse-like, yet never seems to have an empty seat. The back half is cordoned off for the coffee making. They somewhat recently added an attractive out door area, still not many seats, but with an arbor and stand up section that allows for a few minutes of sipping and chatting."
Four Barrel Coffee,"My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. I make a point to grab a coffee and pastry every time I visit. Luckily, it's an easy walk from BART. On this visit, had a coffee (always excellent) and an apple handpie that was amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great little local coffee shop with a lot of charm and high quality brews. Lots of seating but not many outlets and no Wi-Fi to be found - laptop workers beware! Otherwise, this is an excellent spot."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee every time! 10/10 would recommend
Four Barrel Coffee,Artistic Atmosphere. Nutty Flavor Coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,"They're pretty serious about their espresso. Custom made La Marzocco espresso machines with multi-stage temperature sensors and house roasted beans. Definitely worth a visit. Friendly staff and hip, wood dominant decor."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Can't go wrong with Four Barrel Coffee. They have a great variety of beans to choose from and a ""slow bar"" for those pour over fans, including myself. The baristas I've spoken with have good recommendations on beans depending on brewing method and flavor/note preferences."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Walking in, the atmosphere gives you a sense of openness. Rustic wood furniture, concrete floors, the warmth & noise from the roastery and the enticing aroma of coffee give an incredibly unique feel. You may have to wait in line, but once it's your turn the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgable. I had the privilege of speaking at length with several of the people that craft this delicious blends of coffee, and they know as much as their is to know about coffee. Their passion for the bean (which is actually a seed it turns out) is the cherry on top."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I joke that this is my favorite coffeeshop, daycare, art gallery, and indoor dog run, and I've gone here nearly every day for years.  The coffee is superb whether you get drip or espresso drinks, there are always dogs and kids hanging around, and the regulars are pretty friendly.  Try the affogato, which is made with buffalo milk gelato and is very much on the decadent side."
Four Barrel Coffee,"On a recent visit to Four Barrel coffee, with a friend that is truly a coffee aficianado, I experienced what it's like to try coffee that is roasted in house and prepared properly! I ordered a cappuccino, which I usually need to sweeten due to the bitterness I find in most coffee drinks. Surprise surprise surprise, this one did not have any of that bitterness and was delicious just as it was served! No sweetener added. I ordered the maple bacon donut and found that to be utterly delicious. it appeared to be a cake donut but when I bit into it I found that it was actually a raised donut and probably one of the best ones I've ever had.  EDIT: They do not do flavored syrups in their drinks.  No vanilla latte here but a regular latte is delicious all on its own!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice coffee shop! the cappuccino and latte are very tasty and they have french pasteries (viennoiseries - croissants, pains au chocolat, pains suisses...), delicious! The place is big and have many seats, but the music is too loud (too much noise in the morning when you haven't had your coffee yet) but you can sit outside!"
Four Barrel Coffee,Stunning and spacious coffee place! Had a macchiato and a pistachio cookie! Delicious!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice neighborhood coffee shop with an emphasis on the environment (Read : less plastic, more compostable products). Standard  drinks on the menu, no handcrafted drinks. They charge extra for almond milk, which is absurd IMO. Dairy and non dairy deserve to be treated at par as lactose intolerance is not a choice people make on their own!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Probably the best social coffee house in SF. It is never ""laptoppy"", people are actually talking and mingling. On sunny days the patio is great for soaking up the sun, the iced mocha they make is a real deal thing.  I usually sit back by the machinery and watch them bag and move the coffee, pretty amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Come early on weekend mornings, so you have a place at the parklet. Their coffee is good, but don't sleep on their roasted Oolong tea, which is nutty and rich."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Well, great looking coffee shop, I used to like it but these days I barely go there anymore. Long lines, too many hipsters, coffee is usual San Francisco under-roasted acidic overpriced kind. Of course with lots of full fat milk it tastes pretty good."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Delicious coffee, nice seating the parklet out front, and ski ball in the back. I love that I can watch them roasting coffee in the back.  The service isn't overly warm, but everyone is polite and clearly knows their coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,I don't get this place either - just like Philz.  Like a lot of other places in San Francisco - it eludes me.  The coffee is mediocre to actually not good.  It always tastes like the beans have been burned.  And there are always lines of hipsters waiting to get the next dose of caffeine with their fixies parked outside.  Please stop hyping places that don't deserve it.  I do like the coffee roaster and on-site roasting.  But seriously.  Enough with this place.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Yes I'm a Coffee Addict with a capital ""A"" and I've run across yet another cool hipster coffee shop in SF. This one serves rock solid espresso delights and has a very unique barista area complete with a record player. Some of you young'uns might have to google what that is. The space although somewhat dimly lit is airy and spacious. Seating is somewhat respectable and service comes with a caffeinated smile. If you love coffee anywhere remotely as much as I do, you will do yourself a favor and check them out."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I good coffee shop in the area, always bustling. Wasn't a fan of the drip coffee, but lattes with almond milky were very tasty (a nice nutty sweet flavor from the milk that complemented the coffee well)."
Four Barrel Coffee,Literally incredible place for coffee. They roast the beans in house. Along with a classic record playing vinyl in the background and beautiful counters to enjoy the coffee. 10/10 experience. Everything a coffee shop should be.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Tho no Wi-Fi, still enjoys working here"
Four Barrel Coffee,Easily one of mah favorite coffee stops when I visit mah old stompin grounds!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Amazing coffee. So much space, and so little seating -- it's a little annoying. Also, no power strips. No real way to relax in the place. It feels as though they're encouraging turnover at the cost of atmosphere. I have encountered more elitism from the staff than any coffee shop (bar Ritual)."
Four Barrel Coffee,I usually order an espresso with a side of tap water. The espresso was good but it wasn't to my liking. Could have just been their beans or the roast of the day/month
Four Barrel Coffee,Very nice coffee bar in SFO. Good quality coffee in a nice loft athmosphere. You can sit inside and outside. The district was not the best some years ago - but now very nice and safe.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I loved the coffee and the atmosphere. It's also good to calculate the price. But I felt bad when one of the clerks was very unkind. Maybe he was tired or had a bad day. I try to think well, but I can't get rid of my displeasure."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place is rated the fourth best coffee in the Bay Area.  I can see why.  They know what they are doing in the roasting and blending areas, but customer service, like at most coffee places, prevented me from giving them a fifth star.  Our server simply didn't want to go the distance when it came to giving people what they wanted.  Even though we came for a pourover, we couldn't get one.  They only serve pourover coffee Thursday through Sunday.  I don't know about you, but in the business I got my education in, a menu is a menu is a menu.  I avoid drip coffee because I know what I am doing in the coffee business, and got an Americano, which was delicious.  My guest, an Ethiopian, said his coffee was far too bitter.  He comes from a coffee drinking maniac culture, so, word.  This place is a victim of it's own success when it comes to customer service, and while customer service had generally taken a dive over the past few decades, it should not take ten minutes of dialogue to order a cup of coffee I as a customer would like to pay for and drink.  Our server however, just didn't want to do the work.  Any wonder most of them will be replaced by a robot?  I will be journeying to the Famous Farley's next, to see how much respect they pay the customer, because paying respect to the bean in the coffee business is mandatory.  A little effort upon the part of the customer, the person who pays the coffee business's bills, would be a welcome sight.  The LC"
Four Barrel Coffee,Decent coffee slightly high prices if you're in the neighborhood try it if you're not don't go out of your way in my opinion
Four Barrel Coffee,Good house espresso drink(with Kenya beans) and tasty buckwheat chocolate muffin. They request a proof of covid-19 vaccine certificate to hang inside
Four Barrel Coffee,"Hands down the best coffee bar I’ve been. Varieties of coffee, barista, coffee machines, you name it, everything is dedicated to coffee and the customer experience. The do sell coffee beans also.  Not giving the fifth star since there should have been a place to change our baby."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Cool quirky coffee shops are almost the same the world over - expect delicious smooth roast coffee, excellent art, freshly made pastries and a fun, young, arty atmosphere. It's hard to get a seat though, so be prepared to drink your coffee on the go."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place leaves their day old pastries out front each night after closing. They've saved me from more than one hungry, cold San Franciscan night. And I've seen other Homeless people helped out this way, too. I just want to say ""Thank You!"" It means more than you'd imagine!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Some of the best coffee in town both the macchiato as well as the brewed coffee. They got a really unique taste here, consistently, and deliciously."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee shop and atmosphere. Recommend!
Four Barrel Coffee,I can drink their Nitro all day long while I watch them roast their incredible coffee!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee is exactly the way it should be. Not too fancy, not without alot of love. The atmosphere is great with a turntable playing the best random oldies and newies. The best part is that there is no wifi, so people don't stay all day."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee and tea selection. Interesting decor.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee selection with a beautiful, comfortable interior. Also don't miss the special espresso bar on the left on your way in. Only thing to watch out for is very long lines at all times of the day."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place sells coffee at their door despite indoor seating is permitted in SF. Good coffee, have to drink on the street, which is not nice."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Hi there, Thanks for your review. We're in the process of remodeling the cafe, which is taking a bit longer than planned, but should be open in the next couple weeks."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I am giving them the benefit of the doubt, everyone slips up once in a while.  I walked in, there was a small line, ordered coffee, black.  The coffee was way over brewed and bitter.  I went to the counter explained that I thought the coffee might be old or just over brewed.  I was assured that was not possible, but they gave me another cup.  It was sour-bitter too. I have made my own coffee from their beans and it's a great roast. I think they were just having on off day."
Four Barrel Coffee,They only carry 1 type of coffee size (10oz) and the coffee prices are extreme. Is it good as they say not really. Only benefits your getting here is freshly growned coffee. I guess your paying for the freshness.
Four Barrel Coffee,I really don't understand this place. The coffee is decent but other than that it is just a coffee dispenser assembly line.  The tables are very small and take minimum space (same for the chairs). All the focus is on the huge line that forms in the middle every few minutes. During the weekend the bathroom is a forgotten place where toilet paper sticks to your feet.  If the weather is warm enough the cakes will be visited by a few wandering fruit flies and all you will have to look at is the constant stream of people and the occasional dude checking out if there are any unlocked bikes outside.  No internet or working space. Barely any mobile network if you are at bar level and have T-Mobile.  It is a tepid meh.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Cappuccino: $4.50 They only offer almond/macadamia nut milk and cows milk. I have allergies to both so I had to pick the lesser of evils. The flavor was average. Better than starbucks, but no better than any other local coffee joint. Definitely overpriced for the product.  Maple bacon doughnut: $3.75 Exactly what I expected to taste so no ""wow"" factor. Nice accompaniment to the coffee since their espresso brews are on the strong/bitter side as opposed to smooth/creamy. Doughnut is served cold.  Gruyare Bacon Mushroom Quiche: $4.50 Super rich, the marriment of flavors make this definitely a savory dish. Yummy flaky crust, perfectly cooked. Served cold.  Ham & Cheese Bun: $5 Croissant dough wrapping Gruyare and sliced ham. The bun is covered in poppy, sesame and sunflower seeds which gave it nice earthy character. A bit difficult to eat and share due to the nature of cold melted cheese and cold slightly dried out lunch meat. Served cold.  Almond/Macadamia Milk Latte: $5 + $1 (milk choice) Strong brewed. The almond/macadamia nut milk was bland and unsweetened, no noticeable difference between that and cows milk which could be a good or bad thing, you decide for your own palate. The staff was nice, however when one of the baristas was asked if they had whipped cream, she replied with her nose in the air, ""we don't have that stuff here."" Hmmm. Well alright.  Overall, I would say this is not the best choice for price, product, friendliness of staff and location. It's a very busy cafe, crowded with what looks like local people who live in the nearby gentrified neighborhood.  I wouldn't recommend this cafe for tourists or those who have milk and/or nut allergies."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Fourbarrel is a wonderful little place in the MIssion. I remember when I first came to this place, I was mesmerized. Large, spacious, and just beautiful. Baristas are always oh-so-friendly, and I just love watching them roast their coffee beans in the back. I can sit there for hours (and walk out smelling like wonderful coffe)  I've come here a few times now, getting my fix on coffee. However, my favorite here, is their affogato, where they use Frozen Kuhsterd - great little treat on a warm day in the Mission."
Four Barrel Coffee,"From the parklet and bike racks in front to the open-plan roastery (and back alley service counter), Four Barrel is perhaps one of the most perfect coffee places I've been (and I've been to a great many). All of the menu coffees are available as either pour-over or espresso -- but this is a place where you stick to the pour-over, as it's made with great precision at a separate bar (get in the line to the left as you enter) one cup at a time, as it should be. It's also a nice touch that the barista offers your ground coffee to you so that you can check and enjoy the aroma before it's brewed.  Also, the staff is extremely friendly and open. We went twice in one day (early morning and later in the afternoon) -- and on the later trip got a couple of excellent beer drinking recommendations from our barista. That's one of the hidden benefits of pour-over: it takes a little time, and you can talk some with the barista, if you're both inclined.  And don't forget to buy a bag of beans to take home. We did (from SFO to MSN)."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Very hip but still low-key and easygoing, large space, excellent coffee.  Popular meeting spot for groups of 2-4 people.  Menu is somewhat limited, though."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Fourbarrel is my favorite SF coffee roaster, over blue bottle, ritual, sight glass etc. They do espresso, pour over, and have a drip special of the day that's quick and only a couple dollars. The roasters are often working in the back of the shop so you can get a look at what happens behind the scenes."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nothing beats the atmosphere of Fourbarrel - a purely coffee spot in the Mission, just pretentious enough it's worth stopping in. Super cute and rustic looking, Fourbarrel has good, strong coffee. Unfortunately, that's about all they have - don't come here looking for tea or any other beverage variant. Grab a caramel toffee cookie to satisfy a sweet tooth.  Note that no wi-fi and limited seating means laptops and workers aren't welcome here!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"God damn this place is hipster. It's simple, well designed, and chic. Had the mocha which was pretty good, not overly sweet like a lot of other places. Nice and roasty. My only complaint is that there are no outlets in here for prolonged work seshes. Like come on it's a coffee shop.."
Four Barrel Coffee,"My favorite place for espresso in the city. The place has a great vibe: wooden decor, high ceilings, smiling staff, great old and contemporary music. The outside 'parklet' is rad too. Oh, and bike friendly too!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Just a heads up, no WiFi! Came here for a quick break in between work meetings to catch up on email. Coffee was typical, the gentleman who took my order didnt say a word to me, shrugged at my order and mumbled no wifi as if I was a bother to him. Maybe he was having an off day or sick of people setting up on their computers. But the customer service and no wifi kinda made this experience not the best one."
Four Barrel Coffee,"A beautiful, hipstery place with great selection of espresso and pour over coffee. The baked goods are delicious. I love it most for its open floor plan and outdoor parklet seating."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good coffee! Had a mocha and it was done well.  Cool art work and quick service.  Plenty of space.  Limited ingredients so expect a straightforward, simple menu."
Four Barrel Coffee,My husband is a fan of Blue Bottle but I personally like Four Barrel.  One latte in the morning gives me enough caffeine to last me the entire day!  I'm no coffee expert but Four Barrel is surprisingly smooth and has a slight fruity taste to the roast.  Their my fave!
Four Barrel Coffee,"If you love small batch coffee roaster that buys beans from ethical growers from around the world and also sells and serves coffee in the same place, Four Barrels is for you. Definitely a hipsters hangout. Has outdoor seating besides indoors in a big, airy, natural light, rustic modern clean lines space,  At the back of the store is their coffee roasting and packaging area where you can sit and watch Four Barrel employees working at the coffee bar throughout the day.  Can either order coffee via barristas or stand in a separate line to order a personal hand drip cup of coffee.  Definitely a neighborhood coffee place to hang out with friends during the weekend. Place can get very busy and crowded.  There is a retail area where you can buy roasted whole beans by the pound plus coffee making equipment and branded fun coffee mugs that say ""Fuc% It"""
Four Barrel Coffee,Best coffee in the area. Get here early to snag a seat!
Four Barrel Coffee,Some of the best coffee I've ever tasted- bar none. They source (in person) their coffee and roast everything by hand (look for the giant iron roaster in the back). They make wonderful expresso too. Highly recommend you get some coffee and brew it Chemex style (like they do).
Four Barrel Coffee,"Beautiful coffee store on Valencia. Indoor it can be a bit dark, but there is super cute seating outside on the sidewalk. They also sell Dandelion chocolate and beans for you to use at home."
Four Barrel Coffee,Amazing coffee ☕️ and pastries and cool vibe
Four Barrel Coffee,"Took a barista class here with Alex. It was AWESOME. Loved learning about all the different coffee brew methods and about Fourbarrel as a company. and need I say, the coffee was amazing? Really can't go wrong with Fourbarrel :)"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great spot to grab a coffee and chill inside or outside. Good service.  They roast their beans here, so it's cool to come watch and smell the freshly roasted beans."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The place to go to find deep, rich and strong coffee. The crowd is always entertaining here as well. Stop by, sip your coffee and watch the Mission hipsters go by. Tip: On Fridays they have bacon maple donuts!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Hipster cafe with delightful staff and delicious lattes -- i get mine with almond milk for an extra $1. If you're in need of a sugary treat, Fourbarrel serves Dynamo Donuts! For the two-wheeled commuters and city explorers out there (like me), there's a TON of bike parking outside. On the downside there's limited seating and no wifi."
Four Barrel Coffee,The coffee was great. I wish there weren’t any dead boar heads on the wall :(
Four Barrel Coffee,"People, this city is a coffee town. People take their coffee seriously. I was fortunate enough to get a behind-the-scenes tour of Fourbarrel, meet the roasters, the chemists, and the masterminds behind this place, and they were all very geniune and forthcoming about wanting to deliver quality coffee from bean to cup. The coffee is extremely well tended, and comes out tasting amazing. Cool space too, and I don't even consider it ""hipster"". There's even a quite interesting story behind the missing boar head over the baristas. If it's not busy, you should ask them about it. Make sure you have youtube installed on your phone."
Four Barrel Coffee,No Wi-Fi no outlets. $7 hot chocolate
Four Barrel Coffee,One of the best coffee shops in San Francisco. One of half a dozen shops that are also their own roaster you can't go wrong with Four Barrel. Try an affogato or a Gibraltar.
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee is really good the atmosphere pulls the experience to a higher level
Four Barrel Coffee,"The atmosphere in this coffee shop is great! The baristas seem to have genuine interest in making excellent coffee! I had the karatani coffee, which was smooth and tasty :). Also good tips on making coffee and enjoying it were offered by the barista :)!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Location is really nice and cozy. Coffee was extremely disappointing. I ordered an espresso and it tasted like water with coffee leftovers, not like a proper espresso. Don't know what could possibly go so wrong..."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Your pretty standard hipster coffee joint (iphone, macbook air, or bike [parked in out front bike rack] required for entry). Ok I'm being cynical (nor did I have any of those things)! My cappuccino was delish and my bacon cheddar scone went great with it. Service was very nice and quick despite the long line. This place has a chill vibe and what seemed to be cool patrons. If you're in the neighborhood definitely hit this coffee bar up."
Four Barrel Coffee,"pretty big shop, but really hard to find a place to sit. I really like them hosting different artists works and utilizing that huge space on the walls. Coffee itself is so-so, but it's a general SF/American problem."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee place in the Mission. Very spacious interior with sidewalk seats outside. I'm not the best judge of coffee, but I thought it was pretty good :) Dog friendly too!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Bikes and coffee are a thing No? Very well tooled spot with an iron sculpture to lock up bicycles Amazing coffee from people who make sure you get the right cup, right temperature and everything Even if it means throwing it out and starting over again Ah yes no wifi but a fun place to hang out nonetheless"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee, have been multiple times.  So-so service this time.  Staff at the pour-over counter visibly ignored me, so I moved over and got a latte.  As I finished, I observed the same staff chatting with a group of friends. May try other location, or Phil'z, next time."
Four Barrel Coffee,Arguably the best coffee shop in the city. Which is saying something. Excellent world class coffee. Try the slow bar if you’d like the full experience and want to buy some beans
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee is good & strong. I like the ambiance. The small tables are beautiful, however, they could have been larger for more communal setting."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Hipster coffee hangout modeled after, I would think, something similar in Portland or Seattle. Roasters right on premises; visible industrial structure. Art on walls changes out. Woody, raw interior with selection of stuffed stag heads animal rights activists would eschew, but! the coffee is artisanal and good, the musical taste excellent, overpriced small pastries tasty in a pinch of hunger and the staff pleasant, cute, well-trained. Always packed as nearest alternative is at 14th and Valencia - also good - but not hipster and arty. Parklet outside makes it nice place to “caffeinate”in warm weather - If you can’t take any form of gentrification you won’t want to try it, but, otherwise, it’s got coffee lovers covered."
Four Barrel Coffee,Delicious latte and cappuccino. Tasty pastry too.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Absolutely amazing place. The best collection of hard rock LP, and of course the best coffee in town."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love this place - after over a week in the properly-made-espresso-free wilds of North America, this has become hallowed grounds... (yes, it's a pun, just go and have a coffee) ... excellent espresso, properly made, not pulled into one cup and served in another, and absolutely delicious to boot."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Don't expect sandwiches or much food outside of pastries. Just expect some of the best coffee I've ever had! If you have time, definitely check out the slow bar, where they have amazing pour over coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Fourbarrel is my San Francisco roaster of choice.  The small-batch single-origin beans from Blue Bottle are of superior quality, but at double the price they're hardly my stock beverage.  That's where Fourbarrel meets my needs.  Their sourcing and roasting is of an exceptional standard, with the beans working very well with the Yama siphon (my preferred daily brewing method—I reserve the Aeropress for weekends and travel).  As for the location itself, it's a total scene; but that needn't be a bad thing.  Despite an often-lengthy line, the staff are always friendly and cast off none of the expected cooler-than-thou attitude.  For a bona fide hipster haunt the staff treat their patrons with consistent charm and never fail to earn a tip... At least from me.  I'm also a fan of the location.  The art—with a few exceptions—is usually worthy of the walls and I appreciate the woodiness.  Lastly, seeing the roaster in action is a treat."
Four Barrel Coffee,Really really good coffee. Big dogs allowed. Watch them do coffee stuff for realsies.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Cute, hipster environment in the Mission for good coffee, though what you should really get here is b. Patisserie's kouign amann which is AMAZING. The pastry has been been reveled by foodies and magazines, the perfect combination of flaky, not-too-sweet delicious-ness. They have a small parklet out front to sit, people-watch, and enjoy coffee, but there is also plenty of seating inside. Parking is difficult because it's the Mission, with street parking only."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This hipper-than-hip coffee place in Mission has all the makings of a fab cafe - excellent coffee, skilled baristas and a relaxing open-plan space. Expect to wait in line for your perfect cappuccino, though."
Four Barrel Coffee,I met someone there for the 1st time the coffee was great atmosphere as amazing
Four Barrel Coffee,"I've gone off and on but my last visit, ordered a hot chocolate,  took a couple of sips it was fine but as I continued to drink it,  the milk curdled and I was extremely disgusted.  I called to let them know,  they did get back to me."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great barista and definitely a place to hang out! Insta worthy place. But, coffee is quite disappointing. I had ordered a Mocha, but unfortunately it doesn't really suit my taste."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Not only is the coffee on point, but the service was beyond spectacular! The gorgeous black woman (with a smile from the gods) heard about our misfortune and purchased one of our coffees for us...there are still kind people out there!!  Thank you so very much!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Overly pretentious atmosphere and then my coffee was made far too hot and the beans were burnt. Affordable for a cup, but incredibly disappointing given the air the surroundings suggest."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Delicious, well cared for coffee and espresso based drinks. Lovely space that’s dog friendly and not too hipster. Nice are and good music."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Beans: The beans I started using from Four Barrel have been a major revelation over the last year or so. I had been into darker roasts for a long time, but the epiphany at Four Barrel was the flavorful roasts that were not nearly as dark and toasty my prior coffee jones.  Coffee drinks: Excellent. In particular, I like the pressed and Breve. They also offer drip. Baristas seem quite skilled and knowledgable.  Pastries: small, sweet selection --- on the exotic and pricey side. Today, for instance, their interesting flavor selection includes Chocolate/Banana and Passionfruit pastries. The flavors and quality are excellent. The selection does not include much on the savory side."
Four Barrel Coffee,Always my fav and in my opinion the best in SanFran. Service and place are also amazing!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Two words: Jeremy Tooker. Do yourself a favor and research the company's history behind what has really gone down behind the scenes at this establishment before giving them your $$$. Furthermore, don't support shady businesses like this one. There are far better coffeeshops in SF that refuse to take sexual assault too lightly."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Very cool place, good coffee and chocolate croissant. From Italy"
Four Barrel Coffee,They have pour over coffee on Saturdays
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee was okay and always very crowded. Employees are not friendly. They forgot my drink and asked me to just wait even after 3 inquiries. It’s very loud inside so not the best place to chat either. I’d recommend go to other options in the area like sightglass.
Four Barrel Coffee,There are two reasons to come to Fourbarrel: to drink coffee and to show off your bicycle. Do both! This Valencia institution is swarming with Mission hipsters and makes for great people watching while you sip on your super strong soy milk macchiato.
Four Barrel Coffee,"yum, love. Great coffee - expect to pay accordingly (not crazy, though... expected). No wifi, but a perfect place to bring a book or enjoy an analog-afternoon. Recommended!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is a fave for many reasons. Good coffee, very good lattes (mmm almond milk), no wifi, beautiful and spacious wooden interior, pleasant parklet out front, a cool bathroom, vinyl music curated by the staff, a drip bar, and friendly baristas. Check out the roaster in the back and the secret coffee bar back there, too (entrance in the alleyway behind the shop)."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Hi, I'd like a hipster latte please. Yes, this place is riddled with the histerlandias, but who cares, the coffee is on point, the place is beautiful and it's close to my house, so that makes me happy. Good stuff."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Even though I hate spending too much money on coffee, this place is worth it.  The equipment used looks authentically old, and adds to the charm of this place. Nice hang out spot, and plenty of space"
Four Barrel Coffee,They're like an extension of our home. Warm and friendly. Great pastries. Cool changing local art displays. A great place for a quick cup or a long lounge.
Four Barrel Coffee,"It's a great place to work with great coffee, would be better if there were more power outlets! The aromatic smell of coffee permeates the entire cafe and keeps you awake."
Four Barrel Coffee,"The coffee here was good. Given the lack of wi-fi and power outlets, it's clear the intention is to build an environment for socializing over coffee or perhaps doing work which doesn't use wi-fi and/or power outlets.  I respect that, but that would probably deter me from returning. I generally only drink coffee when I work... and currently my work involves using my laptop... whose battery only lasts between 1 and 2 hours when running intensive computations. As such, keeping it plugged in is essential, and finding a place to work for at least four hours is essential."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee and an awesome atmosphere. They also have a fair amount of space to sit down and get work done. A bit of a line, but they're very efficient!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good coffee, solid atmosphere. Only complaint is that it gets super busy all the time. Can be a challenge to meet people there and can take a very long time to get your coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Unfortunately the espresso machine was down today and so we were relegated to some later-in-the-afternoon pour-overs..  Two nice pour-overs today:  1) Kenyan ""Lennette"" from Bird Rock Coffee Roasters (Micro-Roaster of the year 2012) for Ali.  Cherries and Dark Chocolate came out, Red Plum and Blood Orange not so much.  2) For me a ""Tana Toraja"" from Sulawesi (Indonesia) from Demitasse Roasters in San Francisco.  The black tea, bergamot, and red fruits pop out, but no hint of honeydew.  Cute place overall :). Easy atmosphere...  A bit chilly inside - more warmth would be more cozy.  The whole staff is in sweaters and jackets.  The brick is nice, but cold!  Nice stop... Check it out!"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Big, open, and roomy, this large coffee shop has its roastery in the back, complete with counter seating so you can watch the beans on the vintage German roaster. The staff is great and the coffee is tough to beat, with an emphasis on ""artisan,"" “social sustainability” and “direct-trade”. You can get a pour-over or single origin espresso of any coffee on the menu. Pastries complement the java, served on porcelain plates and cups. Laptop jockeys look elsewhere as no outlets or interwebs are available on purpose. There is a parklet and bike racks outside."
Four Barrel Coffee,Interesting but pricy sf hipster coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,In my opinion Four Barrel produces the best coffee in the Bay area. I love to linger and listen to the punk/rock music the play on the turn table while seeing or hearing how the coffee beans are roasted at the back of the store.
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best coffee shops in SF. I love the location and as a decaf coffee drinker, I really enjoy the coffee here. Smooth and full of flavor."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee, staff is spotty they have some people that are wonderful and I love starting my day with and then a few with that uptitty attitude that I avoid like the plague. I buy their coffee to brew at home which is always amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great and stylish venue! Love all the wood. Very tasty hot chocolate. Not a coffee drinker, but I here from others that it's well done also."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee that needs no sugar, a relatable record collection and a fine curation of visiting dogs."
Four Barrel Coffee,Big open space to sip on a quality espresso or coffee beverage while watching the roasting process take place in the back. No wifi but it's a great opportunity to strike up a conversation with your neighbor or read a book.
Four Barrel Coffee,Amazing coffee.. Probably one of the best I had in SF. They have wide selection of beans to buy. The vibe and music is really good
Four Barrel Coffee,"It's all very nice, and a little pretentious, and you can't wait to try the coffee. Trouble is, twice I've visited and been a little disappointed by the coffee flavour."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place has such a chill vibe, and the coffee is good. If you want to take a break in the morning, or crash somewhere for some free wifi after buying a drink, this place is good."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love this place,  everything is almost perfect coffee, atmosphere, pastries and other cool stuff they sell, the set-up and the toasting of the coffee right under your eyes 5 stars but they don't have Wi-Fi and the restroom needs some attention...flooring, toilet, hand dryer, toilet paper holder and the vent need attention."
Four Barrel Coffee,One of the best coffee shops in SF. Perfect flat white. The pastries are great too
Four Barrel Coffee,A very nice coffee shop with top notch coffee and tea and a parklet out front and they plan vinyl disks.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I love Fourbarrel Coffee. The cafe is cool and comfy, and there's a parklet out front, too. They sometimes carry the Kouign Amann from b. patisserie, so get one if you can!"
Four Barrel Coffee,One of the top new wave coffee roasters in the city.  Tasty and fresh baked goodness.  Funky atmosphere with taxidermy on the wall.  The only downside is no Internet.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Tasty espresso drinks made by experienced barristas. Long lines are sometimes an issue, but they manage to keep things moving. No WiFi, but that keeps the cafeCampers at bay."
Four Barrel Coffee,"When you're looking for a great coffee, and you don't mind the pretense, this is going to be your jam. They have fabulous coffee of all sorts. Come.on in and get your inner hipster out!"
Four Barrel Coffee,Overpriced and just not very good. Hipster spot for people who don't like good coffee. Nice location and layout but the coffee leaves a lot to be desired
Four Barrel Coffee,"Hipster place. Beautiful warehouse feel, staff aren’t that friendly. Coffee is ok but not outstanding for the price. Pastries were very good"
Four Barrel Coffee,"Best decaf americano I've found -  no strange aftertaste, no bite, no acidity, very smooth, but almost too smooth, not much complexity to the flavor, but at least it wasn't a BAD flavor. I was easily able to drink this black."
Four Barrel Coffee,I come here pretty often. They have amazing coffee that they prepare in house and they have a cool atmosphere. Their pastries are pretty good too.
Four Barrel Coffee,most acidic espresso ive had in my life. like is it made from raw coffee beans or what
Four Barrel Coffee,Beautiful decoration and ambiance. I liked the bean oven in the back. The staff seems to be truly involved in the coffee roasting and   preparation business.
Four Barrel Coffee,An Ok taste of coffee. Personally I am a little bit picky in choosing the right coffee and sometimes I ask questions. This time the barista didn't know anything about the coffee he was making. Which shouldn't be a problem for most of the customers.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Awesome coffee, one of the best in the city if you ask me. It's a cool shop, you can see their coffee bean roaster in the back."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I didn't get to try the pour-over; the station was behind a separate dedicated bar, which I find uninviting. The pastries look good, but they were inaccessible to me; locked behind obscure, unpronounceable names."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Delicious coffee, cool atmosphere. Don't expect to be able to plug anything in here, but there are some tables if you have a fully charged laptop."
Four Barrel Coffee,My favourite coffee shop in Bay area!
Four Barrel Coffee,"Excellent coffee. The cappuccino tasty and creamy, the pour-over, expertly prepared, sweet and well balanced. The staff is friendly and the locale sunny and bright in the afternoon."
Four Barrel Coffee,"l love that this Starbucks has a drive-thru for the mornings I haven't changed out of my pjs, or when I'm feeling sore after a workout. The baristas are really friendly, I just wish this location was a little bigger :)"
Four Barrel Coffee,"I am a coffee connoisseur (wait, what does that even mean?). And I am a caffeine addict. Convicted. My skin peels and my hair starts falling out if I don't get my fix every AM.  South American Beans. Own roastery. Industrial interior.  Pour overs, lattes, espressos, cappuchinos. Made with the best beans in the city. No kidding. I sent my friend Phil home early to get here, stepped on a star buck on the way, and waived Peet goodbye.  Four Barrel becomes my new Ritual."
Four Barrel Coffee,2$ for a good espresso id far from being expensive. The place is always crowded which bring a nice ambiance. They also have a delicious quign aman which is pretty incredible!
Four Barrel Coffee,"No wifi and no outlets, which is a respectable choice but not mentioned anywhere. (So you end up buying a 5$ coffee and being stranded, with unhelpful and rude stuff). Wouldn’t recommend if you’re planning to work."
Four Barrel Coffee,Still the best and probably will continue to be the best. Perfect espresso and the barista made it look so easy to pull. Excellent roasting > marketing hype.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I am one of the fortunate souls who gets to walk to work.  And my walk takes me past FourBarrel every morning.  I used to be weak and found myself getting a coffee every day.  It's just that good!  Now I have my addiction a bit more under control, but a cup of joe from FourBarrel really brightens my day.  The one downside is the line.  FourBarrel is very popular, and the line can stretch out the door at rush hour.  If you've got the time, grab a kouign amann, an almond milk cappuccino and enjoy the buzz alongside some of the mission's creatives."
Four Barrel Coffee,I stop here everyday on my way to work. Employees are pleasant and friendly in general. The coffee was amazing.. I'll probably go back.
Four Barrel Coffee,Superb. Great space to relax and drink some awesome coffee. I have been to Raglan in New Zealand that does the worlds best coffee and Four Barrels comes close
Four Barrel Coffee,"I love their coffee... though their location is quite expensive. They charge $5 for a latte, plus $1 for almond milk... funny enough other places that use their coffee, sell it for cheaper."
Four Barrel Coffee,"My favorite coffee in the city, hands down. The single origin bar is unmatched. Also, super friendly folks and the coffee snobbery is almost non-existent."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Finally got to try this place! I got Guatemalan coffee from the slow bar, very tasty. My friend got a maple bacon donut which was really good."
Four Barrel Coffee,Solid spot for coffee in SF. The shop hosts a bunch of coffee events on the weekends and they make some damn good single origin pour overs and espresso at the pour over station on the left when you walk in. Make sure to check it out.
Four Barrel Coffee,Fournbarrel has the best pour over coffee in the city. Also a nice place to sit and read a book and enjoy a cup! make sure to go to the slow drip line
Four Barrel Coffee,"Nice place with cool decorations, enjoyed the setting. But no WiFi to study and only had 2 hot tea options."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This place gets wicked packed, but they get you in and out relatively quickly. Good selection of tea and coffee, complemented by some snacks and sides. Affordable, given the area this is in."
Four Barrel Coffee,i love four barrel coffee it the best coffee i ever try . every time i bike past by i have to stop and get a glass of coffee. i love the smell of their coffee a lot .
Four Barrel Coffee,"Delicious coffees and a really cool place. The aesthetic is great, but its super loud... so definitely better for conversation than reading or studying."
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the greatest coffee shops in San Francisco. From decor to coffee, this is the place to be. Must try is the house made almond and macadamia milk with your coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,Ok coffee.  Cold vibe.  Service was great tho.  Coffee is too expensive and large size is Tall at Starbucks.  Not worth $5 for a 12oz coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee is good, interior is cool. I got a pistachio blackberry croissant which was truly magical (minus a couple pieces of shell)."
Four Barrel Coffee,Very nice coffee. Tasty muffins. Spacious. Nice atmosphere friendly staff. Clay cups are cool. No wifi.
Four Barrel Coffee,Big open space with a great vibe. BYO WiFi and battery life like most high end shops in the city. Great iced coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,"The staff was helpful in suggesting drinks and pastries which were fantastic. Friendly, warm atmosphere too in contrast to some other coffee establishments in the area."
Four Barrel Coffee,"This is a real coffee place. So if you're like me, with a sweet tooth, you better explain that to barista before you order anything. Other wise: this place is amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,Good coffee but no wi-fi and no power plugs (or maybe very few that I missed)
Four Barrel Coffee,Great place to get coffee and experience. Music was way to loud. We had to practically shout our order twice. Not much seating.
Four Barrel Coffee,My favorite drip bar in the city. The line is so much shorter than the espresso line (and drip lines at most of the other big cafes). Always a solid choice.
Four Barrel Coffee,Very Friendly baristas.  The coffee was NOT Burnt.  (big deal for me in the days of the horrible Starbucks empire) Excellent vibe from the decor.  Will be back.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Really great atmosphere and beautiful coffee shop but really cold inside, no WiFi, and I actually thought the coffee itself didn’t taste great."
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee and tasty baked goods.
Four Barrel Coffee,"I visited this coffee shop once, and cannot wait to go back. The interior is beautiful, and the coffee is great, with so much attention to detail in every drink made."
Four Barrel Coffee,Their drip bar is phenomenal. An absolute must visit for any coffee fan. Pastries are tasty.
Four Barrel Coffee,the latte does not disappoint and the mushroom tart is worth the try - even though both items are at the higher end of the price range ($4 & $4.5 respectively).
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good coffee, but not great. Pretty social place to hang out and people watch. As someone else said, so many coffee shops, why come back?"
Four Barrel Coffee,The coffee is good but not compared to the hype. Not enough places to sit although they have a lot of space so I guess that's on purpose
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee shop with fantastic design and great house-roasted blends. No internet so you won't see a sea of MacBooks and it's refreshing to see people talking instead of computing.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Enjoy your coffee and embrace your inner steampunk-loving hipster self at this anti technology cafe. Instead of bringing your laptop, bring a good friend and talk about how much you love coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Coffee and atmosphere was great, other patrons were friendly. Staff was not friendly and the girl taking orders seemed to actively be trying to convince people not to order because they were so backed up on drink orders"
Four Barrel Coffee,No idea what the fuss is about for this place. SF has tons of awesome coffee houses and for me this isn't one of them. Went here once and never back again.
Four Barrel Coffee,Love this location! A friendly staff makes my visits always pleasant. All the baristas make great drinks. I will be back to this location.
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the several classy coffee places in the mission, this is definitely among the most famous. I believe a venture capitalist even invested in this one! Good place ot visit."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Good coffee, large open space, and plenty of seating space compared to other coffee shops.  Note I couldn't find any charging ports."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Fourbarrel is well worth the line. Now that all the trophy heads have been restored to the wall, the video of the heist can still be found on youtube -- thoroughly enjoyable. Tip: to avoid week-end crowds, go to the second serving area in the alley in back. The training facility around the corner on 15th Street is interesting for learning -- I went to a barrista milk class with very a yummy Strauss ice cream affagato tasting. The training facily has its own somewhat laconic boar's head, BTW."
Four Barrel Coffee,"They take coffee very seriously.  I've never done pour over, but the drip coffee is well worth a few block walk if you're really jonesin' for that black gold.  No cream and sugar necessary.  If you put cream and sugar in your coffee, you're weak, your children will be weak, and you probably won't survive winter (and should probably check out another, less expensive, coffee place)."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Always enjoy coming here. Consistently good lattes, and great roasted coffee. It has a nice interior."
Four Barrel Coffee,Technically sound staff. Rotating coffee  blends made well and for sell.  Very hipster. They keep the place a little cool so bring layers.
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee and pastries!!
Four Barrel Coffee,Try the coffee tasting....it's free!! Order a expresso or even better an affogato!!
Four Barrel Coffee,"absolutely the best coffee shop in san francisco, hands down. fantastic espresso, impeccable baristas and great consitency. love love love this place."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Love the coffee, the art, the vinyl and the staff:) fav coffee shop in the city. Usually busy. Nice outdoor seating"
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee was okay. I can't get over the fact that they don't provide power sockets. That's just a cheap move bundled in some spiel about allowing their customers to 'unplug'.
Four Barrel Coffee,Terrible customer service and poor coffee
Four Barrel Coffee,One of best coffee roasters in SF!
Four Barrel Coffee,Fast fresh coffee lovely service kinda hole in the wall very welcoming good luck with parking very scarce but worth it.
Four Barrel Coffee,My go-to coffee spot in SF.
Four Barrel Coffee,Love the coffee and their pastries are great too! ( I think they get them from Neighbor Baker which is one of the best in the city!)
Four Barrel Coffee,Cool spot but no wifi.
Four Barrel Coffee,It’s not really how your coffee taste! There are tons of coffee places!  Bathroom Out of service Alwayssss... No WiFi No outlets Super Loud Music “it’s a night club”  Never again!
Four Barrel Coffee,"The coffee was delicious, I've tried the pour over, cold brew, & lattes they are all amazing but the latte was my favorite!"
Four Barrel Coffee,One of two locations in the city. This is the darker of the two with the coffee roasters in the back. Try the slow bar with the coffee sommelier to give you the full coffee experience of a pour over. Skip it if you don't have at least 30 minutes to enjoy the experience and your coffee at the bar.
Four Barrel Coffee,Nice place but how in this day and age does a hip coffee shop Not have guest wifi? Crazy. If i qould have known they didn't i would have gone elsewhere.
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best cafés I've ever been to. Friendly, knowledgable baristas, great coffee, great atmosphere…they really know and love coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee, but can be very busy and loud. If you need a quieter place, check out Stanza nearby."
Four Barrel Coffee,Coffee is really good . Food looks good but I probably did not pick the best option with the quiche (knowing now that they have no way of warming it)
Four Barrel Coffee,"Strong coffee, love the vibe. Great for afternoon work sessions. Has an awesome outdoor seating area, too."
Four Barrel Coffee,A place to get great coffee in the town! Love the vibes in here! The latte is very smooth and creamy!
Four Barrel Coffee,Love the convenient takeout setup. Very pup friendly. Service can be a little hit or miss.
Four Barrel Coffee,"The place does not have plugs to recharge laptops, also the music is too loud. Not good to spend a quiet hour between meetings in the city."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great coffee, super crowded. If you come at the right time they have a smaller counter open in the back if all you want is drip."
Four Barrel Coffee,"Favorite coffee shop in the district. Tons of pour over varieties, great seating, and delicious baked goods (when they're in stock)."
Four Barrel Coffee,Tried it for the 1st time.. And safe to say best latte I've had in a while. Definitely my top 3 spot in San Francisco
Four Barrel Coffee,"One of the best coffees in the city.  No WIFI, great for conversations and amazing baristas that take their coffee seriously.  They even host coffee brewing classes."
Four Barrel Coffee,"I have a hard time with cafes that don't offer wifi. Their coffee is rich and strong, and the atmosphere is nice. Love their new parklet out front"
Four Barrel Coffee,Good coffee and excellent pastries. Staff are very friendly too.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Not a ton of seating- great place for meeting up with folks, less great for getting work done on a laptop. Affogato's was delicious but a little pricy."
Four Barrel Coffee,Nice lively place with a lot of seating area and big open space in the middle. Their coffee is pretty solid!
Four Barrel Coffee,"I’m so passionate about Four Barrel, I decided to start writing google reviews just to give them 5 stars. This is the best coffee ever."
Four Barrel Coffee,our local friends took us there. coffee was good and freshly roasted. would love to visit here again
Four Barrel Coffee,"Great atmosphere, however the coffee is made very weak / milky, so make sure you order an extra shot or have them put a lot less milk in."
Four Barrel Coffee,Tasty banana and choc scone!
Four Barrel Coffee,Great coffee and pastry.  Very pleasant place to sit and visit with friends.  Not too noisy for conversation.
Four Barrel Coffee,Awesome little roasters/coffee shop/café. In the back the coffee is being roasted and in the front you can taste the beans in all of its forms.
Four Barrel Coffee,"Super awesome place to get coffee! Not the place to bring laptop for long hours, but instead grab coffee with some friends and chill"
Four Barrel Coffee,Espresso is too acid. Latta is nice but too.much milk
Four Barrel Coffee,The coffee was good; hipster decor -- I liked the vinyl and industrial feel; baristas were warm and friendly.
Four Barrel Coffee,Best coffee shop in a city with a lot of great coffee shops. Daily roasted coffee. The oat milk cappuccino is divine.
Four Barrel Coffee,Missing pour over menu.. but still good coffee
Four Barrel Coffee,Probably the best Latte in SF. They also have a wide variety of coffee beans for the home brewers.
Four Barrel Coffee,Overpriced lukewarm coffee that took ages to arrive. Full of people taking up seats but not really drinking coffee. Music too loud for the server to hear our order.
Four Barrel Coffee,"The coffee is the best.  Other than that, the place isn't great. But if you want a great cup of coffee, go here."
