Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Friendly staff, beautiful setting & salmon toast was better than expected. The bread is delicious!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Amazing feedback. Thank you so much for giving us 5 stars!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Excellent coffee, by far the best Market Street had to offer. The avocado toast was very generous with their toppings, though lacked salt. The coffee came pretty close to perfection for me in terms of depth of flavour and preparation. Service was a bit curt, but speedy. One star off for the pricing and the minimum 18% tip - too much for the serving size. My coffee was smaller than expected."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Martin,  Thank you for taking the time to detail your experience at our Market St location. We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your avocado toast and coffee. We hope to see you back again soon!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,This is by far one of the best coffee shops with excellent and friendly  customer service in the City! The staff is very knowledgeable and ready to support with your dietary questions and I highly recommend the vanilla latte made with real vanilla! Delicioso!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"It’s so wonderful to hear that you felt valued and cared for by our employees, I’ll pass along the kind words and let them know that they’re doing a great job."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I came here on a Sunday morning. The staff is incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable. As their coffee is Australian based, it's wonderful that they have context, answers, and more insight on their products. If you are looking for a Starbucks fix, this is not the place: no Frappuccinos, no flavor shots, no Blended drinks--which is not a bad thing, just something to be aware of. After drinking the coffee here you'll start to notice how a lot of coffee shops are just watering down their coffee.  My friend and I had: -a cold brew (excellent, boldm and strong), -a Chai latte (delicious and not overly sweet) -2 milo shots (Nestlé chocolate milk) -Avocado toast (flavorful. The inclusion of red pepper flakes was surprisingly delicious) -Salmon toast (straightforward and yummy)  If you are in the area, definitely give this place a try as you will not be disappointed"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Excellent coffee. This is one of the best macchiato  I ever had. $5.70 and I am in heaven. Thank you for coffee magic.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Marianna! We are so glad to hear you loved our macchiato and we hope to see you again soon!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Came here for breakfast on a weekday and loved it. You can either get take out or enjoy table service. The place has a lot of natural light and is nicely decorated. The avocado toast with added poached egg that I had was fresh and super tasty. Good coffee and friendly service.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I came around 11:20 am, hot brew coffee is like an hot americano tasteless, the almond croissant tasted a day or more old, the staff didn’t offer and compensation for that and said it was fresh, which is not  Don’t waste your time going"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,First time at Bluestone and definitely not my last. Very impressed by the neat ambiance and a good Capacino. Also going back to try some of their coffee beans!!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Fabulous coffee and get the raspberry hazelnut croissant!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"One of the best coffees I’ve had in San Francisco.  Delicious selection of local pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse in Potrero Hill, but don’t forget to try their food menu - including Aussie classics like Avocado Toast, Salmon Toast,  classic B&E Roll (Bacon & Egg), or have a go of some toast (if you’re keen, they even have Vegemite!).  Open on weekends all day which is a gem in this part of town."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Friendly service making real coffee to the style and standard expected in australian coffee shops. Highly recommended for when you've grown tired of an Americano coffee and want something better.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Great Australian-like coffee shop. Flat white is well made and they also serve avocado toastie.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Thank you Chris! We hope to have you in again soon for another avo smash and flat white combo!  -The BL Team
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"For any Melbournians (or just people who appreciate a decent cup of coffee), this is the place for you.  The avacado toast is a bit different (see the chilli flakes), but still pretty good."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I love to find a place with great coffee in the US, not many places know how to do a good flatwhite but bluestone lane does! I haven't tried the food so can't comment but it looks good. Very busy place so I recommend takeout."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Had the avocado toast which was a divine! Generous amount of avo on a multigrain toast. Great staff/ barista too! I made a request for my matcha latte to have less oat milk (stomach is sensitive to most milk in general). The barista thoughtfully showed me how much water was added before the remainder of the cup was then added with milk. I really appreciate that! Thank you, I’ll be back!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Yvonne! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed the avocado toast  and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Really great coffee, similar to what Australians would be used to. Service was a little slow even though there were few customers. But coffee tasted great!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Fantastic coffee (I've had the long black) and the salmon toast tastes great. The staff is very friendly and prizes are okay. Will come back!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Great coffee, brekky, and space. Minus 2 ⭐ for the BS Facebook login to get WiFI. TL;DR: use non-Facebook login option and don't fill in the fields, you don't have to. Bluestone automatically posts on your page (-1⭐), and harvests unreasonable private info (-1⭐), such as: DOB, email, list of friends, gender, your likes, where you live."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Great spot for coffee, especially the flat white. Breakfast is decently tasty yet simple."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Cheers, Lisa! See you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"We had a tasty breakfast here. 😋  Egg, bacon and cheese croissant was yummy. Cappuccino with almond milk was perfect.  They look after the planet with 100% recyclable and compostable cups 👍"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Thanks for being a local – we’re so glad you enjoyed our  Egg, bacon and cheese croissant and Cappuccino with almond milk. We look forward to seeing you soon!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I have had good coffee and food from here before.  But today, my avocado toast was so spicy that my mouth still burns after two glasses of water and flat white.  Why do you do that to an avocado toast??"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience was not up to standards and would like to learn more. Please contact us at greetings@bluestonelane.com so you can provide your full feedback for us to review.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Tasty, but a bit small,  hot chocolate and friendly service.  Pricing and labeling is very confusing though. There are two sizes for hot chocolate, but only the price for one is listed.  Pet peeve: they also feel that customers should pay for their employees' health care, not their employer."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Old review: Decent coffee shop that serves classic macchiato, and serves coffee beans too."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Great, hearty toasts for the morning. The staff is really friendly. The chai is on the sweeter side and more of a sweet chai latte than a chai."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Mahek,  We are so glad to hear you have been loving our toast bar and chai latte! We hope to see you back at our Market St location soon to enjoy some more great tasting drinks and eats from BL!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Love the food the service and the coffee and ladies in the morning are wonderful. My client came back out of the hotel room down the hallway to tell me that chai latte was really good. Y'all Rock
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Hey Jason – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"We walked in on a Sunday. The store had an awful sweat smell, it was very pungent, so we didn't stay. Staff is friendly and their flat white was delicious though."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Eeek. I ordered a yogurt and granola bowl with lemon curd on Uber Eats. They put bacon grease instead of lemon curd in the bowl. Must have been a mix up because lemon curd looks a lot like cold bacon grease. Repulsive and enough to make sure I never get food from Bluestone Lane regardless.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,It's cute but if I'm paying 7$ for a large iced latte with oat milk I want to fall in love with the drink. The staff is super nice though.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Friendliest baristas in downtown San Francisco by a long shot. Sam took the time to explain the entire menu, which includes a number of uniquely Australian options. Their espresso-based drinks are richer and smoother than Blue Bottle, and the happy atmosphere keeps me coming back every afternoon. Bluestone has replaced all other options as my daily stop for afternoon caffeination."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"No friendly services , gave paper cup for lunch in . Avocado tastes so so, if u looking for great coffee & brunch.. no a suggestion"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Chris,  We are sorry that your experience at our Market St location was not up to standard.

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Good strong mocha. Very comparable to blue bottle. Love small mum pop shops like this that sprout up around the city.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Not the friendliest customer service but the coffee and banana toast was yummy!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hey Angela,  Thank you for stopping by our Union Square Coffee Shop and for taking the time to leave a review. We are sorry to hear that your customer service experience was poor, this is not the typical Bluestone standard and will alert the team with your feedback.  We do hope to have you back in again soon for another coffee and banana toast!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Definitely do not stop in if you need to get a quick espresso. Only two staff members were there and only one of them was actually helping customers causing a long line after our order. The man was taking orders and making coffee which made the wait longer than necessary. Unfortunately after waiting more than 15 minutes we had to leave to make an appointment, and list the money we’d paid for coffee and tea."

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Really beautiful coffee! Enjoy it while you take a walk around those gorgeous San Francisco neighborhoods!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Iris,  Thank you for coming into our Market Street location. We are so glad to hear you are enjoying our coffee menu. We hope to see you back in again at one of our locations to enjoy some more great coffee.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I moved from NYC to SF 8 months ago & I was over the moon when I saw that one of my favorite cafes was going to be following me here! I made it in a few days after they opened & the decor was as Instagram-ably adorable, the coffee as delicious & the avocado toast as perfect as I’d grown accustomed to from my Bluestone Lane experiences in NYC! I seriously hope they open up a shop closer to where I live in the Richmond, but for now, I’ll take a Lyft line across town because... WORTH IT!! Love you, Bluestone Lane!!! 💛💙💛"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Great toast!  A lovely spot to wait until MOMA opens.  The coffee was meh (unfortunately).
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hey Ira,  Thanks for stopping by our Union Square Coffee Shop! We're sorry to hear that our coffee wasn't quite up to scratch. We take our coffee very seriously and would love the opportunity to make this up to you and provide your next coffee, on us. Please feel free to email us at: feedback@bluestonelane.com and we would love to chat!  Cheers, The BL Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I’m an Aussie based in NYC and thought Bluestone Lane would be a safe bet from breakfast. What a disappointment. Similar to the review below the service was shocking (at one point the ladies behind the counter didn’t even look at us when answering a question about the payment screen). The protein bowl was just a bunch of ingredients thrown together, and the avocado toast was average - all served in unnecessary packaging when other cafes around the city are back to using crockery and cutlery. Sad to see this."

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"My first time patronizing Bluestone in San Francisco. I had a few minutes before the arrival of my bus going to work and there was only one costumer so why not . I order a hot chocolate not only did he not make my drink, he served a costumer that arrived after me . My drink tasted like hot water and I missed my bus from waiting for twelve minutes. NEVER AGAIN ."

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I ordered a salad and it was covered with rancid avocado. I scooped it off and ate the rest of the salad which was fine. After my meal I showed the avo to an employee, she dismissed me, said that “is how it is” and there was nothing she could do. Then repeatedly spoke over the top of me with “thank you” while I was trying to say you serve that avocado. rude. I have spent over $1000 at bluestone (avery lane) & had nothing but pleasant food & service. Don’t eat here & on principal, walk the 1min up market st and buy your coffee at blue bottle - it’s very good."

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"What a lovely, cozy little cafe! Great range of menu options across both the sweet and savory spectrums. Delicious coffee artfully crafted. Decor was warm and welcoming with plenty of seating options. The raspberry croissant was one of the most delicious pastries I've ever eaten! Would definitely come back again and hang out for a while for a peaceful and leisurely weekend breakfast."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I was impressed with their peppermint tea. Real tea that is brewed with really hot water with lots of flavor - just like it is suppose to. So glad I did not buy tea in Starbucks and drink that colored water. I also had their almond butter and raspberry jam multigrain toast, and it was tasty, good quality bread. Not cheap 3.5$ toast and 3.5$ medium tea, but I was happy to pay for the quality. Service was good as well. Would come back."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I wanted to like this place so bad. Went originally because they are listed as an Oatly oat milk vendor. They ended up using Pacific brand oat milk that contains Gellan Gum in it and it's not that yummy. They were out of avocado, which was there toast menu item I wanted. Settled for the salmon gluten free toast. $1 upgrade for oat milk, $2 upgrade for gluten free toast, not worth $18. Absurd amount of packaging for the salmon toast, maybe that's why is costs so much. Took over 10 minutes for my toast to be done and there was maybe one person ahead of me. Staff was not the most warm and welcoming. Happy I tried it but will not return to this location."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"This restaurant is unbelievably overpriced. I paid $49CDN minus a tip for two avocado toasts and two small coffee's. They don't accept cash and you collect the food from the counter. Honestly, I could not have been more disappointed in this restaurant. There are so many better options in San Francisco. The coffee was lovely but the food was average."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Best place to get a proper flat white around the city!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Hello there Josiah - thank you for your feedback! See you soon!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Friendly staff, awesome chai latte. Try the avocado toast"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"This was easy, just go to the number 1 recommendation for gluten free breakfast in San Francisco. Although it was some distance from where we were staying i decided to go there for a birthday treat. What a disappointment! The staff were friendly and efficient in the American manner. Unfortunately the trainee put my gluten free bread in the wrong (unlabelled) toaster, worse he put the ordinary bread in the gluten free toaster rendering it unuseable for anyone with problems with gluten. They didn't have a spare toaster in case of such problems and the manager only made a cursory attempt to redress the problem, offering me oatmeal or nothing! As it was my birthday i chose to have my smashed avocado and poached egg on plain bread. Nice, but not what i had wanted. Expensive for what you got and a disappointment for its first place ranking."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Lisa,  We are sorry about the situation that occurred at our Market St location. We would love to chat with you further about the situation to find a way to make it up to you. If you would like to email us at feedback@bluestonelane.com detailing your experience we would love to try and resolve the issue.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Try the Smashed Avo Toast and a Flat White :)
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Helpful staff, avocado toast was delicious.  Latte was smooth."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Laura! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed the avocado toast and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Spectacular coffee. WIted 25 minutes for them to make avocado toast. It’s like they didn’t think anyone would come to the store. They also give themselves this giving back to the planet eco friendly look and give every single person who gets something a gigantic box for the food. I don’t usually care but I had 35 minutes to look around. One of the girls was on her phone making jokes as it took forever. Very frustrating experience.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Visited a Bluestone Lane in NY City Times SQ a few weeks ago and had a great pour over coffee. I was super excited when I saw this store on Market Street.  Was hugely disappointed that they didn't offer pour over coffee. In fact, the worker said they specifically do not offer it because it takes too long. The Flagstaff drip coffee was okay, but not great.  With the increasing trend and popularity of pour over coffees, I think that's a missed opportunity. I won't be coming back to this Bluestone."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,OMG!! Australian-style coffee!!! So needed!!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I had been to one other location and had a nice experience. Had great toast and espresso this morning to ""eat-in"" but was disappointed when everything came to go. When I went to discard the excessively large box and cup both the trash and recycling bin were filled with them.  Staff was friendly."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,This place has amazing customer service. Workers were friendly and helpful. I couldn’t decide so they gave me a sample of both! Cold brew is ok but the Golden latte with almond milk is excellent!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Cold Brew all the way and if they don't offer pour over don't try a different selection...
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"This Bluestone Lane location is fine, but it's on a block with a few other options--and compared to those, it doesn't always stand up.  In particular: I think being a takeaway coffee counter is where this location shines. It's the best coffee within a few blocks, in my opinion, but it doesn't really have a sit-down area, aside from a few flimsy tables outside. It's close to Yerba Buena, so you have alternative options! But it's not a place you can stay and work or a place where you can meet someone for a drink.  By comparison, Mazarine Coffee right up the block has better seating, as well as better food options. Cafe Dolci, also right up the street, has better food options if you're looking for takeaway, as well.  So, while this location has great takeaway coffee, it doesn't succeed at much else! That could be just what you're looking for, but otherwise, it's just okay."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Thanks for you review! We're glad you could stop by our Union Square coffee shop. We're constantly working on improving our in-store experience and hopefully we see you again soon.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"If you like expensive toast, this is your place. Hurry up before the office folk find out, or you'll have to wait in line like all the other expensive toast places. Sadly, no one who works there really knows what's in their products, so steer clear if you have allergies or if you are an ethical consumer."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Delicious toast and outstanding service.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"It’s a super small takeaway Bluestone Lane which is a lot different to the ones in NYC. However if you need your hit of a soy flat white, check this place out. They usually run out of the smashed avo for brekky if you don’t get in early so keep that in mind. The banana bread goes down a treat though."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Karen,  Who doesn't love a good soy flat white! We love to hear you are loving the Bluestone Lane experience wherever you travel and we hope to see you in one of our locations again soon!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"The food is amazing, but the customer service is severely lacking here. Just ordering seemed like an inconvenience to the girls behind the counter today and they were extremely rude. Learn how to treat people better. I won’t ever return to this location."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Ashley, My name is Curt, and I am part of the customer support team at Bluestone Lane. I am disappointed to hear about your recent visit and we have passed this onto our operations team to address. If you'd like to chat further, please feel free to email me at greetings@bluestonelane.com Cheers, Curt"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Sure would be nice to be acknowledged when walking in or even during ordering on the touchscreen. Two employees clearly focused on tasks rather than customer service.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Christopher, My name is Curt, and I am part of the customer support team at Bluestone Lane. I am disappointed to see the rating you provided and would like to know more of your feedback. If you'd like to chat further, please feel free to email me at greetings@bluestonelane.com Cheers, Curt"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Coffee was good and food was okay, but service was terrible, the staff unhelpful and unfriendly. Also, there were only three seats inside for customers so we had to sit outside in the cold to eat. As well as this, they served everything in cardboard containers and plastic cups; very environmentally unfriendly."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,I ordered a cold brew and they gave me an iced americano but didn’t feel the need to tell me. Until I asked. I wouldn’t have ordered coffee had I know they were out of cold brew.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I don’t drink coffee so much so I can’t say anything about how their coffee tastes like, but their matcha latte was good (it’s unsweet by default). Their avocado toast is great too, I should’ve added egg on it...!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Nice avocado toast
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hey, Chan! We love the avocado toast, too! We hope to see you again soon!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"If you want to order the promoted ""Avocado Toast"" with the egg and all that good stuff, you have to order the ""Avocado Smash."" Very good coffee, nice service."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Coffee was okay here, not sure if I had a bad one since I’ve been to the other bluestone lane and really liked it. I’ll give it another shot, but I wasn’t too impressed"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,I love the coffee here. The staff always takes care of me. They basically start making my order when they see me at the door.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Tremaine! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Wanted to get a small taste of home (melbourne) while on an extended trip to CA. Was extremely disapointed and dissatisfied by the fact they only serve coffee and food in single use paper coffee cups and coated cardboard boxes with disposable cutlery regardless of whether you eat in or not.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi James,  We are sorry to hear you were disappointed with your experience at our Market Street location. We do appreciate your feedback and are excited to say we are working towards compostable packaging and we do currently offer keep cups. We do really appreciate your review and will continue to try and work towards being a more sustainable company.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Amazing, just like in NYC.  Gluten free bread alternative for all their food and oat milk alternative for all their coffees on request.  Try their golden (tumeric) or beet latte. Something different than your typical brew!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Pricey but really nice and quiet. I loved it but I'd never imagine paying so much for two pieces of toast and coffee.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Good coffee and their avocado toast is worth every penny. Also love that you can get Milo here.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"This place is becoming my favorite coffee place in the area. Apart from having an amazing awesome coffee option, the staff here is very good and is always ready to help you. They have a decent place to sit and good eating options. Both there plain croissants and chocolate croissants are to die for! depending on my mood, I go for there ""Magic"" or my usual double espresso. You cannot go wrong with what you pick. I have tried bringing the coffee home also for my espresso machine and it tastes amazing! MUST TRY!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Just tried the salmon toast on Meal Pal and will be going back for brekkie again tomorrow. Can't wait to try their coffee - Aussie's love their brew!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Delicious avo on toast, coffee and croissants"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Charlotte,  We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your experience at our Market St location! We hope to see you back again soon to enjoy another great avo toast and a delicious coffee!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"If you're the kind of person that likes avocado toast or Australian coffee, this is your spot. Otherwise I'd probably look for alternatives."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Amazing flavor! The bread alone was delicious, topped with cream cheese, smashed avocado, and salmon was a flavor combo unexpected and wonderful!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Avocado Toast yummy , nice to go packing!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"If you're looking for genuinely quality coffee, this is the place to go. I would rate it over Blue Bottle and Four Barrel, which previously I would have said were the best coffee shops in SF.  Also does great food - I highly recommend the avo smash (add on feta and egg!) or one of the pastries they have on offer. Plenty of options for non coffee drinkers too, such as turmeric lattes and the like."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Very hip place, nice ambience. Didn't find the coffee to be that great."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"A gentleman from my job brings me this coffee on occasion and it makes my entire morning! I remember my first reaction being ""Mm. This is a good cup of coffee."""
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Coffee is mediocre at best ... If I was in Sydney I would have chucked it..  Staff are polite and friendly..  Another store not taking cash even though it is legal tender...  Will not be going back...
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"A friend of mine took me to here to try turmeric coffee for the first time which technically is not made from coffee beans but instead a combination of almond milk and turmeric, served hot and with a touch of added spice atop. It was excellent. All the great benefits of turmeric in a tasty beverage, I was happy. I also tried the beet coffee which was quite good. Lastly, their breakfast and lunch menu items look incredible. I'll definitely be back to try some of those."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Ok folks here it is.....I am an Australian and finally found a place in SF that understands coffee OZ style.....from the La Marzocco coffee machine to the educated barista.....tasty and a delicate creamy texture without diffusing the beautiful flavour of coffee.... Strong recommendation if you are a true coffee drinker.... Note....cashless enterprise so bring card or.....NO COFFEE FOR U..... Yes place is small but tables and chairs outside but not on sunny side of Market st so bring a jacket....even in Summer .....worth the inconvenience if you want good coffee making....❤️
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Service is good, environment is good. However the cappuccino didn’t taste good. It tasted like nothing, can’t feel the aroma from coffee beans, or milk."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hello Xingtong,  Thank you for stopping by our Union Square Coffee Shop and for taking the time to leave a review.

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Bluestone in SF! Nice! I think they could use a little NYC attitude, and they don't quite do vegemite on toast as well as (most of) the NYC spots do, but probably down to the bread choice. Excellent coffee, concise service, crisp surroundings."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Great coffee, friendly staff, food is good as well if a bit pricey. Only quibble is lack of good indoor seating, not a cafe you can work in"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,This place is amazing Romeo she rocks. I love it that she remembers what I ordered 2 weeks ago. My new coffee spot to support.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I really reccommend getting your coffee here. Its a mixture of columbia, brazilian and eiropean coffee. I order the mocha smoothies. Definitely coming back."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Stallings, My name is Curt, and I am part of the customer support team at Bluestone Lane.

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Amazingly friendly staff. For the size of the cafe, they have a fair amount of cute, comfortable seating. The avocado toast and flat white are fantastic, and service is quick. Free WiFi. It's a little pricey, but very much on par with other FiDi spots."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,If you're Aussie and missing good coffee and vegimite on toast this is the is the place for you.   I didn't even need an extra shot like I normally do in the US.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Latte not good at all. Heart of this place has been over automated :(
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and have passed this feedback on to our local and operations team. Feel free to email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com for further feedback.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,So far the best coffee I've had in the bay area.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,I had the salmon toast. It was worth the $9. I know $9 for toast?! But yes worth it. They have friendly service. I was there for a breakfast meeting and they made sure we had what we needed and didn't bother us. Which I feel for is important.  The only down side is the tables ag against the walls are close together.  It was a tight fit for me to move into and out of my seat.
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"This place is fancy as hell y’all. You Tryna glaze real fast on some folks take them out for coffee here and they won’t know what hit em. Totally love the gentrifying feel of this place, amazing aesthetic that that don’t follow the tech bro vibeZ ya feel? Very cutesy and small, really recommend if you’re out on a date or showing friends around or just Tryna be bougie for a day"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Simply the best I've found in SF! Great coffee, Aussie style. Not the cheapest but the best generally isn't."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Tasty food with a simple menu & well presented. Clean and tidy environment.  The only question I have is whether the staff do get all the tips?  They don't take cash and when they take your order and card payment you get presented with  a screen which asks you if you want to tip, I think, 15/20/25 percent of the order.  Not so sure about this system, as I don't know if the staff get all the tips as it's a card payment only system.  If the staff do get all the tips, then they have the potential to make a fortune, as there is an implied pressure, from the screen, to tip as you have to press it whilst standing in front of the staff placing your order and ahead of seeing any real service!  If the staff do not get all the tips and a part of it just goes to the company behind bluestone(so you are just paying more) then is that fair to the public?  I am sure the staff know the answer. That all said it's not cheap, but it is tasty."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Great little Aussie cafe, fresh healthy menu options. I wish they had Milo & Vegemite on the menu."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"The best “proper coffee” I could find around Market St ☕️  Flat white, long black, piccolo & macchiato - the full range is available!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Ben,  We love to hear you are loving our Aussie coffee menu! We hope to see you back at one of our locations soon to enjoy another great coffee.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Loud music overshadows experience. Was very excited to find a place near the office to enjoy  a beverage and conversation. This is not the place! I even asked the server if the music could be turned down. She told me that was their 'vibe'. No matcha latte is worth me getting a headache. I won't be back!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Saving Aussies one coffee at a time. After several days of very ordinary coffee, discovered this place. Pricey but worth it."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Quality coffee. As an Australian living USA it is hard to find, so most appreciated. Also appreciated that Anzac biscuits were made for Anzac Day."

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,One of the best cafes from NYC has finally made it to SF!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I'm Albertino and I represent district B-6 of SF and beyond. Most people say how did you get a job like that? Well, the days of what you know are long gone, it's who you know now. I got word of Bluestone Lane coming to SF in March of this year, but didn't spilled the beans. Half a year went by and Front St location finally open. This isn't the only one, in fact they're pushing for five locations city wide and I know of three confirmed. Now, I just got my first taste of Australian coffee and judging from first sip I know it's good beans. My cappuccino went down smooth with equal parts foamed and steamed milk. No bitter or burnt bean taste just clean silky smooth from first sip to last drop. Ceramic mug had traces of foamed milk stuck on it's side. Good indication of well-made espresso.  Service is efficient and wait time is reduced due to it's cashless POS system."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Capps are super good!
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Hi Eric,  We are so glad to hear you are loving our cappuccinos at our Market Street location. We hope to see you in again very soon to enjoy another one.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I’m on business trip from London, Me and my colleagues was about 15mins to this coffee shop from where we’re staying. Looked nice.. I ordered my coffee and banana toast, paid and sat down, after 5mins my banana toast arrived... another 10mins went by... no coffee... another 10mins.. by this time I’m nearly done with my toast, I had to walk up to the counter 3 times to ask where my coffee was. Staff apologised and gave me a free coffee voucher. Not great 1st impression. Won’t be using the voucher."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"Great coffee, a little crowded and noisy for a morning meeting though."
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"We walked from Pier 39 to grab a coffee and a bag of beans as we are travelling around and thought beans to go would be great for those times when we are not in the vicinity. The coffee was its usual standard, but when i asked for beans ground for a plunger, they explained that the Front St. store seel beans, but does not grind beans. Further, if we’d walk another 10 minutes to the Market St cafe they would grind our beans “free of charge”! Really? This the first coffee shop I’ve come across that will sell me beans but refuses to grind them to order. Very disappointed!"
Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,Good coffee and a nice sandwich the egg is a good addition to the avocado toast. would recommend 👍 …

Bluestone Lane Union Square Coffee Shop,"I was waved away by someone working inside the cafe as if to say “we are closed, don’t try to come in” at 8am on a Sunday when they’re hours on the door say they should be open (google maps says they’re open at this time too)"
