Blue Bottle Coffee,"Friendly team and comfy beautiful space. An exceptional oat milk flat white, tasted amazing and a beautiful pour!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The cafe has very limited space but has managed to do optimize it rather well. The walls are glass, the seats are modern. However when you look out the fancy glass walls all you can see is the trans bay terminal lol.  The coffee itself is standard Blue Bottle fare (ie really good). And they do make waffles at this location!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Stoked to finally see this open! Went in today and my usual order from the 2nd street location (still closed) tasted just as I remembered!
