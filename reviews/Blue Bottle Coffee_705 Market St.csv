Blue Bottle Coffee,"I’ve heard people talk about Blue Bottle before, so I thought I’d check out one of their  coffee shops while I was in town. I wasn’t disappointed.  Although, there weren’t fancy syrup flavors for someone like myself who likes sweet flavored lattes, they still had a “sweet latte” on the menu. If you’re into sweeter coffee drinks, I’d highly recommend it. Very delicious.  There’s even a gorgeous park right around the corner you can hang out in after you get your coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Clean coffee shop with basic decoration. Love the style of their icon. Water is offered by self serving. Coffee tastes great but higher price than other shop.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Maintains the excellent Blue Bottle standard. Very good coffee, Friendly and helpful staff, great surroundings."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I'm consistently impressed by the quality of coffee at this shop. The flavors are robust and well-balanced, and the environment is peaceful and comfortable. I highly recommend stopping by for a cup."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Solid blue bottle location. This place gets a lot of traffic so line can get long but staff moves quick! Theres a decent amount of seating and large tables for working at. Due to the high volume of people it can get a bit noisy if you are trying to get some work done.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"One of my new favourite Blue Bottle cafes in San Francisco. Awesome space and design, same great coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The best bluebottle branch in downtown SF. Coffee is consistently great and staff is always friendly :)
Blue Bottle Coffee,You really can't go wrong with Blue Bottle coffee. It's consistently very good and the staff is friendly.  The interior is modern and clean with spots to sit and work. The only downside is it's more expensive than most cafes.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Had the most great tasting Cappuccino ever. It could have been a little warmer, but it was absolutely delicious! Wonderful artistic design on top. Cudos to the team! All was very enjoyable!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,It's always great coffee at any blue bottle place. A little slow to get my order when it didn't seem busy. There is some outdoor seating as well as public benches right next to it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"As usual with blue bottle, it is a very well lit and comfortable place. Coffee is great as usual as well. Not too much sitting space though."
Blue Bottle Coffee,My espresso shot tasted like a small cup of coffee.  Not sure why my to-go cup was full; it seems it was extracted for too long.  The taste wasn't bad but not a typical espresso.
Blue Bottle Coffee,There are NO electric outlets anywhere in the shop to charge up. Be prepared for that. Was annoying but the coffee is amazing.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Wow.These were the nicest people ever.I can't recommend enough,the service is amazing,coffee is also great,perfect spot!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Very hip and chic with mix of stools, wall benches, some standing hightop tables. Also has a part of the wall lined with a counter top that provides stations for a semi private/solo laptop session or personal coffee time. Your inspiration motors will be put into high being such an open plan space with high ceilings; a mix of industrial look and clean minimalist design; a lots of sunshine, the window overlooking the main entrance takes up the whole wall. If that is not enough to get you going, the energy of the crowd of young professionals plugging away on their laptops, having an immersed business meeting or just lounging around in their thoughts over a cup of coffee will give you some juice. As for the coffee, you see the barristers in an finely polished art of coffee making. Two downside is that it is a bit loud in there and you are going to be doing some work that demands high concentration, then this is not the spot. Also, not suitable if you need to do work online as we couldn't find a WiFi connection. I had to use my phone's Hotspot service."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Place is finally opened up to sit inside!! Blue bottle coffee never fails.  So good!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The staff is very friendly, and there's plenty of space to stretch out. A very chill location. Drinks bomb as usual for Blue Bottle."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Usually my first stop into SF. Good seatings and easy to find parking back street.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee and chill vibe! Very bright, open  and clean. Jason helped us at the register and really went the extra mile to brightened our day ;u; I definitely would recommend stopping by here!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,My favorite BB location in SF.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle coffee is great, I've visited this location and there other cafes many many times. However the baristas at this location are perhaps the most entitled and rudest I've encountered. Initially I thought it was a one off thing or they were having a bad day, but on every visit their attitude has been the same. I would recommend management start mystery shopping this location.... like I said, coffee is great but the baristas need an attitude check."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, average to expensive price. The space is amazing but they don't have Wi-Fi"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I never had this much burn flavor from the latte at any Blue Bottle. It was not welcoming atmosphere neither. The space itself is nice but I don’t want to pay for the burnt roast beans which was really really bad.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I try to avoid this place since it's owned by Nestle but it happens to be the only place in the area selling a latte on Sundays. Golden Goat is nearby and makes a better one but they're only open on weekdays. Cento coffee in South Park is open on Saturdays but the latte isn't as good. A Blue Bottle latte is of acceptable quality though you'd be hard pressed to find a more expensive brand.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Very nice and friendly staff. They make me smile 😊 I got this cute coffee today. …
Blue Bottle Coffee,Really good location and nice seating area. Enjoyed seeing the baristas doing their thing while sipping on the always amazing Blue Bottle coffee!
Blue Bottle Coffee,I stop here every week. The coffee is consistently good and a life-saver. Nothing can possibly compare!
Blue Bottle Coffee,The food closet had 4-5 bugs inside and the workers kept serving people from the food in contact! Gross!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This newest SF location of Blue Bottle is my fave! It's airy, bright and has the most cheerful baristas. One latte to go please ;)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Love that it opens early. Nice open cafe. A little more difficult for business meeting but no problem for casual get togethers or getting some work done . Nice corner cafe near south park
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I'd come and stay here everyday! What a nice place! Good coffee, good service, nice people!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The coffee is great and the service is fast and efficient, but what with the interior design of the branches? The impression is of a lot of empty space inside... Cold industrial look and feel. UNINVITING. Maybe some warmer design could be better"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Well i am addicted to Blue bottle, but this is my favorite branch. During the pandemic I went there almost every day. The baristas are super friendly. I just wish they would start serving the avocado toast like the other branches."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Lively place on the corner. Drenched in sunlight which keeps your eyes open as much as the coffee does. Each cup is custom. Mine was great.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Very cozy and friendly location. We take coffee and pastries there several days a week. Yesterday the barista (I’m sorry I don’t know his name) gifted us two coffees as “cool baby discount” 😂❤️ it was super nice, thanks! …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Well hello Blue Bottle. Your age reducing detox facial has done wonders!!!  If I were running a business of any kind, and this space was available for rent, I'd swoop in and pay cash!!! The space is stunning!! Nice, clean lines, very modern and could easily pass for a hipster SF loft. Classy AF!!  This is by far the most practical and user friendly Blue Bottle shop I've ever been to. They represent the product extremely well and clearly the brand is on display for all to understand. Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder could walk through the shop and would know within moments that they are within the Blue Bottle walls.  Now, a fact that very well could be news to some of the coffee consumers in this area. The pour over, which I have come to believe is the only method of coffee brewing (hot coffee at least) that works for me. The owners of Blue Bottle went all the way to Japan, where the pour over was invented, to learn the art of the pour over. That's a solid nugget of intel to provide your ""friends"" with next time you sit down to drink coffee.  Now, the barista on shift when I was here Sundee was an excellent coffee adviser. I asked him which coffee he preferred and he clearly read my mail. He said, ""the Three Africas holds up better to dairy and provides a creamy finish."" Sold!! I generally refuse to order blends, but in Blue Bottle I trust. #Trust  The shop is nestled very well and I drove right by them without noticing the logo, but I think that's because I wasn't really looking for them. Full disclosure. I was on the way to (clears throat) Philz and couldn't find parking over there, so Yelped coffee and was pointed in the direction of BB. Found parking in the lot beside the shop and I suspect the parking Gods deserve some credit here cause that's not exactly the easiest hood to find a parking spot. Glad it worked out that way cause yeah, this is a really solid location to put your feet up and enjoy a solid cup of coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee, pet friendly store with dog treats at the counter, and a warm staff."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This place is adorable and has wonderful service. I didn't stay, but I could imagine working here for hours on a laptop."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nice atmosphere and good coffee, they have drip coffee and espresso coffees.. the only thing I didn't like is that the cappuccino wasn't hot enough for me.."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"They have a special coffee cocktail menu at this location and I have to say, this shakerato is delicious. Espresso, shaken cream, over ice."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Awesome coffee — cool vibe. TIP: Your in the middle of the startup vibe of SF.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Parking is usually open on either side of the street. May need to circle the block once or twice.. Drip coffee selection is always on point. Staff is super friendly and seating area is usually very clean. There are also two VERY small tables outside if you prefer to have your coffee outdoors.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Grabbed a quick cup of new orleans cold brew and it was solid! Great service too, it took me less than two or three minutes to order and be out the door with my drink. Great choice for coffee in the area :)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good coffee and yogurt but the price is extremely ridiculous. $12 for a cappuccino and and a cup of yogurt (7.2 OZ).
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,So kind n sweet guys.. wanted to take a pic together.. no brave..ahhhhhhhh...
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Best coffee experience ever. Our server, George, had a radiantly positive attitude and fantastic recommendations. The coffee was great too!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I just want to give a shout out to Ryan his hospitality was the best encounter i had while visiting San Francisco. The Peru coffee he suggested was amazing. Thank you so much!
Blue Bottle Coffee,The best coffee in town with friendly baristas and fast service. What else could you ask for? Thanks!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Just arrived from Oz, first stop. Friendly, relaxed, quality. Barundi pour over, mello, chocolatey. Playing Daft Punk, Random Access Memories. Thank you 😊 …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Kind service. Let me bring my bike in after asking (it was very early in the am and it wasn’t crowded). Beautiful store in exposed brick and steel soma gem. I prefer the iced decaf mocha  with whole milk.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Excellent bright beautiful coffee served by smart helpful batistas. Woo
Blue Bottle Coffee,"COVID REVIEW: A bit pricey for an iced tea or an espresso drink. But, they've done a nice job with the sidewalk seating and tables. And staff could not be more kind, warm and genuine. Nice little pit stop for on one's way to work."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I used to work nearby and comes here pretty often. Durning the week this place can get very busy, but the line goes on very fast because most of them are to-go orders. During the weekend it’s fairly empty, and it’s easier to grab a seat and enjoy the afternoon. Since it’s right next to a park, you can enjoy your coffee in the park on the sunny days."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I like this place for a shot of espresso. You can really taste the flavor profiles. They don't over roast their beans, which seems to be common at other chain coffee shops. A tad pricy, but I'm willing to spend money for a better coffee if I am out."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee on some days but a very inconsistent offering. For cost one is paying I expect a my coffee to taste great everyday. They really need to quality control there coffee temperature. There is no lack of coffee shops where you can go for good coffee but poor service.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I'm almost tempted to give this Blue Bottle a bad rating just so it doesn't get too busy lol  Actually though...  This is one of my favourite Blue Bottle locations, especially on weekend mornings when it's not too busy. The staff is generally friendly and helpful if you have trouble deciding what you want. If it's a nice day out, it's awesome to take coffee (and maybe a pastry) to-go and hang out on South Park nearby. If you do decide to stay though, there's plenty of tables and seating, making it a good place to work. (Not for too long though; it is a pet peeve when people stay at a coffee shop - any coffee shop - longer than they should and take up tables and chairs.) This location also has big windows with a lot of natural light, which I LOVE! ❤️"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great hospitality and tasty coffee as always! I really like the current Winter Bloom single origin coffee. The aroma smell and the fruity taste in a perfect balance.
Blue Bottle Coffee,No free refill  and a five dollar coffee=π®😐. Grate coffee and nice looking place. …
Blue Bottle Coffee,"EDIT: 7/29 Customer service made it right. Thanks guys. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Disappointing. Pour over was cold after they put a splash of milk in for me. Maybe I’m gauche, but I asked for Splenda, and they gave me sugar. Didn’t stir it or give me a spoon, so all the sugar sank to the bottom and my last sip was like cotton candy. Waffle, on the other hand, was hot and delish."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Thanks for letting us know! I am so sorry for the experience. Would you be able to reach out to us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com. I would love to help further with this. Best! SG
Blue Bottle Coffee,Beautiful and bright cafe serving the city’s original speciality coffee. Highly recommend getting a cappuccino brewed on whatever special espresso they have that day. Worth the extra dollar for a sweeter and more flavorful drink!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Really good coffee compared to the nearby offerings on 2nd st. Ran out of New Orleans when I stopped by around 3pm. They opened in Nov 2016 so hopefully things smooth out over time. Amazing looking space though. Check out their specialty drinks before getting your usual.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Cashier guy was really nice and helpful suggesting a drink for my brother (who is disabled). Unfortunately the guy serving the coffee kinda made fun of my brother when he picked up his coffee. We won't be back.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Chubby Asian barista made us wait 5min while she was doing a pour over she didn’t even look at me after I cleared my throat. The guy picking up dishes in the lobby came and took care of us we ordered 2 pour overs that took 10min. I find it rude that she didn’t even acknowledge me at all.  The guy on the register apologized and gave me a free drink card which made it better. I clearly see everyone working around her. She lacks customer service qualities
Blue Bottle Coffee,"edited: 7/30/19- the wait time has drastically reduced... now the coffee is awesome and the wait is as expected.  Great and friendly staff....5 stars  Previous review: Coffee is great, the wait is ridicules! Avg wait time is about 20 min from order to receiving coffee consistently and today the milk wasn’t even warm."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no, we're sorry to hear this! Please get in touch at support@bluebottlecoffee so we can assist!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Very relaxing, lots of space, counters, table along the window, big community round table. . Tables along the windows is great natural lighting for people to study and do their work. . Counter space meaning there's a bar where you can watch them make drinks. It's quite nice and relaxing. . Big community round table - great for large groups or one who wants to spread their work all over. . Drink - so I tried their elder berry sparkling water with cold brew. It wasn't my favorite, due to the flavor and not enough sweetness. It was just different, either love or dont like it. They were nice to let me switch back to my regular. . My regular to go to is the new Orleans. But the girl told me they have oat milk and I'm like yasss! It's one of my new favorites so this is how your order it. One new Orleans with oat milk. . Of thing I noticed about their coffee is that its strong, and they serve you these big ice cubes which slowly melts and doesn't water down your coffee. . Overall this is one of my new blue bottle coffee spot to actually chill when I'm in the city. Comfy with space, and air flowing in and out which is quite refreshing. Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This place is on my way to work. I get a latte and it is good coffee but the Baristas are always rude. This one occasion the baristas ignored these two 6yo girls who asked twice for napkins, they served people out of order, the wait for coffee was 25mins with no explanation. But what really gets to me is when I pick up my coffee and say Thanks they act as if nothing happened and ignore me. So I’m actually going to Starbucks now because I prefer to get coffee served with a smile."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Very smooth and delicious coffee. It’s the best in the area for sure. The staff is very nice and polite. Be prepared to wait a little while during peak times. It’s with the wait. They also have Oatly milk, which is delicious for lattes."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Upscale and expensive coffee place focused on drips. I had a latte and an espresso and they were meh, but the dripped coffee and the mixed drinks like the one with orange and jasmine tea were great. The pastries are excellent too, albeit a little bit on the unhealthy side. It's remarcable they show some nutritional information for most of what they sell. It's insanely expensive, but that's the norm for this kind of places. It's comfortable to work with your laptop if you get the right place, and they are accommodating towards it, but most of the tables are not laptop-sized."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee and great customer service. Coffee is prepared to order and really fresh. Can be crowded but it is definitely worth the wait. Coffee is organic and you can get single origin beans.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Nice store but when we were there but the fastest service
Blue Bottle Coffee,"BB Coffee of South Park main clienteles are techie workers along the stretch of second street. They open early enough for even the first wave of workers arriving. Really nothing more to say as every BB is the same to me just different location. Baristas are efficient follow through procedures and will re-do your coffee if you don't like it. Lastly, be careful walking across the street. Blind spots from delivery vehicle can pose a hazard."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Latte is very creamy and smooth; not your run of the mill coffee here.  Baristas are friendly and conversational, and the decor is sparse/industrial/hipster.  Feels right on a sunny day with lots of window exposure, and is right at the entrance to South Park on 2nd.  A definite step up from the bigger franchise coffee merchants."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good place for downtown IT workers.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The manager here is so kind, he covered the cost of one of our coffees and gave a woman in need a free coffee as well. Wonderful service and a great stop on our trip!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Always a great coffe
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great atmosphere, coffee, and staff. Blue bottle coffee is one of the best in SF. This location can get busy midweek, but worth the time if you encounter a wait."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Best coffee spot, new location by south park is just as good as any other. Extra hipster. When I was there there was a guy with his brand new macbook pro with touch bar listening on his earpods. It was comedy."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Easy walk up service for coffee and espresso even during Covid. We also got a ham and cheese sandwich which was cold, but still tasty."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nice and spacious, great for chatting. No wifi unfortunately. Coffee is good but pastries are hit or miss (pretzel knot is a miss for me, bit salty)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The New Orleans is the perfect treat with just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess. My husband and I will often drive across town for this drink.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Stopped here with my coworkers on our way to the office. It was the best coffee I’ve had in a while. I love the oat milk. So so good!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"My favorite coffee spot in South Park! The staff is extremely nice and courteous, especially George. Feels comfortable stepping in here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"A fool and his money are soon parted. If you’re one of those who says: if it’s expensive it must be good, then go here. Otherwise avoid, avoid, avoid. Extremely overpriced average coffee. Nice decoration on the milk foam but not worth two and half time times the price."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Nice coffee and the service time was prompt.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Love their waffles, and sweet latte. Always a good treat when visiting my dad at work."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Usual amazing Blue Bottle coffee but space is bigger than usual Blue Bottle. It's not just a small space but has tables and benches to sit down. Still not a large space.
Blue Bottle Coffee,My favorite coffee place is so good
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Decent cortado, it wasn’t bad, but wasn’t great either."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle coffee is always great. Tried their Hazel Expresso...awesome flavors. Fully recommend this place, definitely going back..."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee! The place to go to in SF for a good espresso
Blue Bottle Coffee,Old fashion was delicious but the wait was long.  It's a popular place and pour over single cup coffee always takes longer.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great atmosphere, fantastic coffee and good service. Make sure to try out the cold press bar for a special experience!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nice, sunny place at the corner of South Park. Conveniently located near offices and the Giants Stadium. Love the cold brew!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Amazing coffee! I go out of my way just to start the day with their coffee. Yesterday I had a Mocha and today a Capuccino
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Very good coffee parlor, friendly baristas."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Love the coffee, love the crew and the amazing design:)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee, nice location, and a great first date spot. Food area is unclean however, I've noticed bugs hovering over the items."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Very lively and busy place. Nice decoration. Super busy right after lunch time. It is a bit pricey but coffee is excellent.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, as usual for most Blue Bottle locations."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Stopped in quickly to grab a cappuccino. Great coffee and service.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The coffee is great, which shouldn't be a surprise. But it's quite popular so expect a wait and a loud ambience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The best coffee around and tasty pastries. Bit hot in there when the sun comes through the large windows. But still worth 5*
Blue Bottle Coffee,Very good coffee. Not a lot of attitude compared to other roasting companies in the Bay area.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle is good, but not great. There's a little bit too much pretentiousness here.  My favorite is the cold brew"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good coffee and surprisingly fast service despite a long line. Nice atmosphere too!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Italian level espressos sold here. Enough said.
Blue Bottle Coffee,In love with blue bottle!!!! They have a gluten-free lemon Tea cake that is amazing!!

Blue Bottle Coffee,Superb espresso and all other coffee related drinks. Lovely staff.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Friendly crew! They were swamped and yet smiling and calm. I'd go back.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Maybe they were having a bad day, but terrible, terrible service and barista. Just terrible. If I wanted a cold brew, I would have ordered it that way"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hip place with artisan baristas. The menu is centered around coffee. If you want something else, go somewhere else."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great staff. Very friendly and excellent espresso drinks.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great place! Really awesome blends for fresh drip coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nice place to chat over coffee. Friendly staff, good decor, plenty of tables and chairs."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Just had the green tea, but it was really good. Friendly staff and good place to get some work done."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Definately a top 3 coffee for me and a must stop every time I visit the city
Blue Bottle Coffee,What's to say? Really good coffee and good service. Layout was nice as well
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good, but always looking for a few more sips from those tiny cups."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Not crowded, the coffee was great just as other blue bottle stores"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Awesome coffee if you have time, the queues can be  rather long."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Delicious coffee - beautiful decoration for every single cup. Every time is quite an experience.
Blue Bottle Coffee,For something non-caffeinated and refreshing get the cascara fizz (cascara is made from the dry skin of the coffee fruit). Sweet and sparkling.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great design by BCJ and nice atmosphere. Coffee is okay. Wish they have wifi.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Some of the best coffee and super friendly staff!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle was great!  Friendly service, amazing coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,One of the best coffees in town! Freshly filtered for each customer
