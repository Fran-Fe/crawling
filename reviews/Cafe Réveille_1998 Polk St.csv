Cafe Réveille,"Love Réveille! Every location in SF is great, but we usually go this one because it’s closer to our home. Fresh and home roasted coffee, great selection of Japanese loose tea that they serve in Kinto teapot😍. Amazing breakfast and food quality. Prices are great! Also their pastries are from Starter Bakery which is good too, but before Starter bakery used to bake better quality for wholesale as for me. Anyway, highly recommend this place - their breakfast, tea, coffee, fresh squeezed juices and best chia pudding in the world!!"
Cafe Réveille,"When I arrived there was a line that took around 10 minutes, but the staff were friendly and made my order very quickly. The cappuccino I got was great, as was the coffee cake. I will say that there were some smaller light brown species of cockroaches in the bathroom crawling around on the sink. This was a bit unnerving, but nevertheless it was reasonable for SF so I can't blame this place in particular."
Cafe Réveille,very normal i was kinda craving a regular croissant normal but could only find sweet pastries. maybe I'd come here to study as a student... the coffee looked good too. not too expensive for decent quality. just don't expect nothing special. gotta give them props for the ginger tho that one had my socks spinning
Cafe Réveille,"Sorry, but this place is the definition of mediocre. Food, coffee, service and atmosphere are super mid. Just nothing special about it."
Cafe Réveille,My favorite coffee in town! Their cappuccinos are addicting :D They also have great brunch options. Lots of space both inside and outside to sit down. Also dog friendly!
Cafe Réveille,"(Update) In case helpful:  Indoor seating: yes WiFi: yes, with protected password Restroom: yes, two Recommendations: Acai bowl for food and latte for drinks  Ordered the Homestyle Breakfast and Açaí Bowl, for coffee we had a latte with oat milk and another latte with almond milk. The food was good and the coffee was good too. Slightly on the pricier end, but felt that Açaí bowl was especially worth it!  Update: I’ll probably keep updating as I come back to the place, but so far I’ve had:  Food: Homestyle Breakfast, Breakfast Sandwich (with the works), and Acai Bowl. I like Acai Bowl the best so far.  Drinks: I’ve had latte w almond milk, capuccino with almond milk, matcha latte with almond milk. I like my matcha latte without so much foam (some places make it like 80% foam so there is almost no weight to the drink at all) and I like that here, it was rich and creamy instead of being foamy. I still think latte with almond milk is the best.  Pastries: For pastries, both coffee cake and croissant were good. I might try to get the croissant warmed up next time :)"
Cafe Réveille,"An impressive coffee place in the neighborhood!  Dropped by this place to pick up a coffee for the go. I was impressed by the ambience of the place and friendliness of the staff.  We got a matcha latte and latte. Both were delicious. They had a single size, the prices are at par to Starbucks. The size of coffee is similar to Grande of Starbucks.  I didn’t dine-in but there were people who were dining indoor and outdoors. The condiments - sugar/ cream area is open too.  Will definitely go back to their other items on the menu!"
Cafe Réveille,"The best breakfast bowl I've ever had. So flavorful, filling, and beautifully presented! The breakfast sandwich, coconut breakfast bowl, and smoothies are all so good. Everything I've had so far is tasty and reasonably priced. Love this local spot for brunch."
Cafe Réveille,"Really mellow atmosphere, with modern decor. Tall cellings with plants placed above the windows. Perfect for enjoying a coffee/tea beverage.  Food is very good, had the eggs and potato breakfast with a side of falafel. Chimichurri was awesome.  I'm hoping to go back soon and try more dishes."
Cafe Réveille,"Been here multiple times, always great coffee. They also have baked goods and smoothies/bowls that are yum! Tasteful interior and great spot to WFH"
Cafe Réveille,"Come here for coffee & a chocolate kouign amann or a healthy-ish brunch! I love this place so much but my favorites are definitely the espresso drinks, kouign amanns, chilaquiles, the açaí bowl, and any breakfast that comes with the smashed golden potatoes. It’s dog-friendly (but no indoor seating at the moment) and has a few different locations.  Will def be coming back here again and again!"
Cafe Réveille,"Great venue for breakfast/brunch. It gets really busy but if you patient it is worth the wait. Very healthy options (food and drinks). The team are really helpful, friendly and professional."
Cafe Réveille,The breakfast burrito was so good. And the shakshuka was very good. cinnamon roll Was OK only cause the surprise raisins 😅. First time and I think it my breakfast spot.
Cafe Réveille,"Relaxed modern cafe in the mission area of SF, super close to the last CalTrain station if you are commuting into the city :)  This place got featured on the LV city guides for SF; we had to check it out to see what the hype was about — not going to lie, aesthetic af!  I didn’t get a chance to try a lot of the menu; I got the locally brewed Golden Shore Iced Tea. I’d recommend you check this out for small groups or for a modest work session!"
Cafe Réveille,"Cafe Reveille is my go-to for mid morning weekday brunch and, by convenience, early afternoon laptop tapping.  Coffee is solid, breakfast options are all tasty. Pastries come from nearby luminaries like Neighbor Bakehouse (you should go to there as well...).  The Moroccan shakshuka is hearty and delicious. For lighter fare, go for one of the avocado toast variations.  Only downside is that brunch ends at 11:30 when they switch to a lunch menu.  Dear Réveille staff - if you’re reading this, please bring back the cold brew. Thanks."
Cafe Réveille,"Had a breakfast burrito, great tastes and filling,..you may want to share this one.  Group was happy with all the their selections."
Cafe Réveille,"Lovely place for a good weekend brunch. They have quite a few options for food. Tried the latte, almond croissant, lemon poppyseed muffin and a  breakfast sandwich (with the works). They forgot to put hot sauce in the breakfast sandwich which kind of made it taste bland. Absolutely loved the almond croissant and the muffin. Do give it a try. Will visit again to try their acai bowls."
Cafe Réveille,"Love this cafe, great spot to read, grab a cup of coffee. Their food is healthy and delicious. Can't go wrong"
Cafe Réveille,"Delicious food, strong and tasty coffee. Sometimes the staff messes up my order but they’re quick to fix.  They’ve recently started sometimes having folks add their own creamer and sweetener for your latte which I am not a fan of, but it’s hit or miss depending on the barista you get.  When they do actually do your latte for you, it looks pretty."
Cafe Réveille,"Currently takeaway/outdoor seating only. But, very pleasing and warm atmosphere inside when you order, though the music is a little loud to hear the barista. Located right at the intersection of quiet residential streets, this is a must-visit. The cream/sugar area is currently not available for customers and requires a staff member to administer."
Cafe Réveille,"Easy parking around, nice outdoor seating, although can get a little warm during lunch time. We got grilled chicken sandwich, açaí bowl, latte and cappuccino, all are yummy"
Cafe Réveille,"Efren Villalobos Head Chef Cafe Reveille Feeling great and happy to serve fresh, local, sustainable and most organic food to our guests, using fresh seasonal products, supporting our local farmers and committed to provide a great experience in every dish that our team will prepare for you"
Cafe Réveille,The food is really delicious here and service is always A1 at that. They have a wonderful menu selection and the service staff are the best.
Cafe Réveille,"The go-to sit-down-and-vibe cafe in Mission Bay. Been here more times than I can count. Great breakfast burrito and funguy pasta. Okay coffee, but the overall atmosphere makes up for it."
Cafe Réveille,"Grabbed the matcha latte with oat milk in the morning here. Although it was already 8:30am, there was a decent line around 9 (around 5-10 people). Food options ranged from savory toasts to pastries, all looked good. This branch has quite some seating for a coffee shop, though the tables are a bit small. If you’re looking for a casual workspace with decent coffee and food, would highly recommend! I plan on going back soon."
Cafe Réveille,Has that new feel and a designer menu. The burger did not disappoint and came off the grill quickly. Wish my working boots didn’t have me falling over the table when I got up.
Cafe Réveille,Great local Instagram-worthy place. Amazing breakfast plates: from smoothie bowls to fry-ups. Great coffee too.
Cafe Réveille,"Love this place and their breakfast bowls are the best, honestly they have the best dirty chai latte. ✅ I love ordering and walking to the park to much in peace. Sooooooo good, try everything on the menu. Also I don’t mind spending good money on fresh quality food."
Cafe Réveille,"Love this cafe! Their Acai bowl is the bomb. So many textures and layers, and a pretty sizable portion too. The rest of the food looked good too so will def come back here to try more on the menu.  Worked here for a few hours on a Tuesday. Thought it would be quiet and empty but it was bustling. So not a good place if you want some peace and quiet but nice for people watching and if you like to work in more lively environments. The wifi was good but I couldn’t find any power sockets."
Cafe Réveille,"I had an iced coffee and an open faced toast. Coffee was quite big and really amazing! I would not recommend the toast. Ambiance is nice for laptop work, reading, or a coffee meeting. Most of the seating is a bit sunny and can get hot in the early hours."
Cafe Réveille,Love their açaí bowl! The food and coffee here are great! They have a variety of different flavor profiles in their dishes and service is pretty fast.
Cafe Réveille,"Very hip environment. Ie, a decent cross-section of hipsters South of Market in Dogpatch area. Kitchen closed early on a Sunday, around 3 p.m., but selection of pastries was quite good. Quality of barrista craftsmanship was quite good. Seating can be difficult to come by but nevertheless a good place to socialize or read a book."
Cafe Réveille,The açaí bowls here are amazing!  I also love the fact that the barista asked how much water I wanted in my americano.  I feel like most places put way too much water in!
Cafe Réveille,Great morning spot to grab a coffee and breakfast Sandwich. Low key vibe in and outdoor seating.
Cafe Réveille,"Actually I have been back to Taiwan from SF for 5 months so far...and I don't know why this delicate cafe just came to my mind, then I just realized how much I miss this place! Miss the Latte, the avocado toast, and the atmosphere there! So I just want to say if your are visiting San Francisco or you haven't been there, please walk in and taste some happiness :)"
Cafe Réveille,Used to regularly come here but the service has extremely gone down. Baristas are very impatient with customers but also very slow to make drinks. Loved coming here every morning before work but sad to stay we no longer enjoy coming here. Tried to give it another shot multiple times and faced same issues with barista’s attitude.
Cafe Réveille,One of the best  Açaí bowl of all time - consider this comment from someone who had all the best rating açaí bowls in Hawaii
Cafe Réveille,"This is my second time being here. Personally, I don't have high standards for coffees, but I do love the vibe and the lights coming through the windows. A great place for hanging out and chatting with friends."
Cafe Réveille,The breakfast bowl was wholesome and high quality. Smooth delicious cappuccino as well.  They have outdoor seating if you have your dog with you.  Bringing the dog inside just to order was not a problem.
Cafe Réveille,Wonderful spicy shakshuka breakfast in a modern clean space. Quick and friendly service.
Cafe Réveille,On the pricey side but drip coffee was great and food was very tasty with healthy options available. Coffee had fruity notes and was not over roasted. Had a great breakfast there
Cafe Réveille,There was bacon in my veggie breakfast burrito. Coffee was good. Acai bowl was good.
Cafe Réveille,"Delicious Coffee, healthy and savory lunch options but a bit pricey. The pastries are pretty good too!"
Cafe Réveille,"First time trying this place out and it was a hit! Loved the tea, coffee to-go, and breakfast sandwich. I'll definitely plan to go back after weekend visits to Barry's Bootcamp."
Cafe Réveille,"Amazing food, excellent service and lots of cool dogs to see."
Cafe Réveille,OMG. Their breakfast burrito is so delicious. Salsas have just the right amount of heat. Espresso is also great- this is my baseline for coffee places
Cafe Réveille,"I was looking for a quality place to eat and thought 7:30 am might be too early for such luck. I'm so lucky I found this spot. The matcha was beautiful. The bowl seemed thoughtfully created. It had tasty, clean well prepared ingredients. Anyway, I like what this place is doing and hope to come again soon."
Cafe Réveille,"This Reveille is the most beautiful one of San Francisco location, spacious and clean as hell. Too good of a place for working on your computer, grab a quick vegetarian bite, or meet up with friends for coffee in mission Bay Area. Their outdoor seating feels so good under the sun."
Cafe Réveille,My dish was quite dry. A sauce would have helped to make it more interesting. My husbands shakshuka was very delicious.
Cafe Réveille,"I really love the food here everything is really good. Plenty of options for vegetarians, quality cooks and quality coffee drinks. Also the tea is top tier"
Cafe Réveille,"Good coffee, a bit slow in service, atmosphere is a bit sterile"
Cafe Réveille,Just was passing by this cafe and really loved the design inside and decided to order the matcha latte. So Yummy!😍 Barista is very friendly and making great foam🤤 …
Cafe Réveille,So many delicious options for a quick breakfast or snack. You can't go wrong with the acai and mango spinach superfood bowls.
Cafe Réveille,The acai bowl was very good. My partner liked his breakfast sandwich as well. High quality and well-prepared ingredients all around.
Cafe Réveille,Decor is very instagrammable. Prices are a bit high but worth checking it out. The pink tables outside were my fave.
Cafe Réveille,"Got the chocolate croissant and breakfast sandwich, were both quite good."
Cafe Réveille,"Don't let the relatively short menu discourage you, the food here is good. The indoor and outdoor seating is well spread out and everything is kept clean. Service was quick and easy with the standard order up front and take a number stand for the table format. There are various parking options around including street and public parking sites with Caltrain, Muni and bus stops also close by."
Cafe Réveille,It was a delicious plate but adding some vegetable would be better.
Cafe Réveille,Great food options! Love the eggs with mushroom combinations they offer!
Cafe Réveille,"Very friendly staff, delicious food, good place to get some work done. Opens early in the morning. There is a great wifi. No power outlets just yet (indoor seating was not open as of the time of writing). Pleasant outdoor seating space, maybe there could be a bit more outdoor seats given how popular the place is."
Cafe Réveille,"A little too much wait time, only one cashier. It’s a good place."
Cafe Réveille,I was surprised by how good the drip coffee is at this place- perfect for sitting and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere or a quick to-go cup for when you’re on the run. It might even be my favorite coffee in the city!  They have a full menu and the food that comes out of the kitchen looks amazing (I haven’t tried it yet). Their selection of ‘ready to order’ food is so good; the pastries are amazing and the ready made toasts are delicious. The staff is friendly and if there is a line it moves pretty quick. It’s one of my favorite places in Mission Bay.
Cafe Réveille,"Had heard good things so we wanted to check it out, but after waiting in line for 20 minutes, when we got to the counter, we were told their system had been down and that we wouldn't be able to order food.  I said it would have been nice for them to tell the large line of people, so that we didn't have to wait for nothing, and they just responded ""yeah sorry we weren't sure how long it would last"", yet it had already been 20 minutes.  I then suggested that they tell the rest of the long line, and they said ""yeah sorry"" again, and then didn't bother telling the rest of the line (which ended up leaving one after the other after finally getting to the front).  These sorts of things happen and it would have been okay if they had just told us, rather than wasting everyone's time.  We'll give it another try in future, but a disappointing first experience.  Edit: We've had a few good visits, the food is quite good, but it's really hit and miss as far as how long it'll take. E.g., it took upwards of 45 minutes for a breakfast wrap and burrito, even when the restaurant wasn't full."
Cafe Réveille,This is an excellent place to have really good coffee in a nice light-filled space. The pastries aren’t bad either. They also have plenty of outdoor seating when the weather permits.
Cafe Réveille,"The service was quick and friendly. A little pricier than I would have liked, but average for downtown SF. My half and half cappuccino was killer. ❤️"
Cafe Réveille,Local roaster of single origin coffee. Trendy and lay back environment.  Perfect place to spend an hour sipping a cup of coffee in the morning.
Cafe Réveille,"Reveille has a great vibe, fabulous Latte’s, and friendly staff. My wife and I were so impressed when we first walked in. There was a small wait to get our coffee but the barista made us feel right at home.  The ambiance was exactly what we were looking for; modern and clean. It was very quick and the area in Mission Bay is very new and trendy.  The best part is that the coffee was excellent. We had just gotten the worst coffee that we threw away because it wasn’t worth it. Reveille hit the spot and made everything worth it."
Cafe Réveille,"The coffee (espresso) was horrible, I wouldn’t recommend it at all! Disappointed because the place is nice, and expensive AF."
Cafe Réveille,"Only open in the morning. Kitchen is really slow, if you're looking for food to grab and go, this is not the place; a breakfast burrito can take 15 minutes to make.  This would make a great afternoon coffee spot but limited hours make if difficult to take advantage of. Faster food is available immediately across the street."
Cafe Réveille,"Excellent place for brunch, coffee, or dinner. The space is beautiful and the staff is pretty chill. I know a friend had poor service one time, but I haven't heard anyone else have issues and I certainly haven't. The food is really good, but a bit on the pricey side (a little more than SF avg). Good place to work as well, though not many outlets."
Cafe Réveille,"Horrible unseasoned food. Only is seasoned with salt..... maybe pepper, it tastes absolutely disgusting! I have no idea how people stand this place.  Not to mention the girl at the register made me wait while she was ordering something for herself so i was just standing there at the counter.  Never want to come back."
Cafe Réveille,"Great coffee, not cheap especially if you need almond or soy milk though which adds an extra 75¢."
Cafe Réveille,"The service is a bit slow but incredible food, coffee, and a really nice ambiance."
Cafe Réveille,"I love this café! I used to work here all the time pre-COVID because they had a great location and great atmosphere (lots of windows/sun, and very chill but lively). The lattes here are my favorite, very well-made and comparable to Blue Bottle which is my other go-to. I would rank Reveille’s coffee as some of the best for specialty cafés I have been to in the Bay Area. It can be a little pricey, especially if you get the non-dairy replacements that cost extra. The food is also quite good, generally nutritious and with great flavor. Not cheap but I would mostly consider it worth it. The baristas are very friendly, and takes time in their prep, which I really appreciate. If you’re in the area I highly recommend stepping in for a coffee or some food, and enjoying it in the park nearby."
Cafe Réveille,"The customer service at this location was beyond atrocious. I went between 11am-12pm on a Sunday and I moved to take a drink that I mistook for mine. Rather than politely correct me, the barista working there publicly accused me of being a thief even though they knew I had ordered the exact same drink.  Not to mention this place is outrageously overpriced for the quality of their beverages.  If Google would let me give 0 stars, I'd do that in a heartbeat. Don't go here!"
Cafe Réveille,There was only 1 person in front of us and 2 baristas yet we waited about 10-12 minutes just to give our order. Got the iced coffee but it was too bitter even with cream and sugar. Have had their lattes before and those were decent.
Cafe Réveille,"4.5 stars, rounded up  Thumbs up: - Nicely varied but not overwhelming menu (and everything smelled amazing!) - Delicious smoothies! - My friend later told me that she loves this place; high quality dishes!  Thumbs down: - A bit loud and crowded, was hard to find seating for two - Wobbly table"
Cafe Réveille,"45 min wait on a less than busy Sunday morning for a juice and açaí bowl. Everyone who ordered hot food got their order within 10-15 mins. After following up multiple times, was told the person making juices was on a break and the juice wasn’t still ready!!! (Didn’t know only one person at a cafe knows how to operate a blender) got the açaí after 45 mins. The açaí was hard frozen and could not be consumed. Won’t be coming back."
Cafe Réveille,Perfectly prepared Latte art and delicious coffee. We forgot a shopping bag there and came back to friendly and kind staff who noticed and set aside.
Cafe Réveille,"Easily the only coffee shop worth going to in the area. Their imported coffee beans and special roasting techniques combine to make the freshest coffee I've ever had.  Not to mention they have the friendliest staff; especially kyle who always makes a different house-blend coffee roast for me, and every time it gets better and better.  *********WARNING: THEIR COFFEE IS SO DELICIOUS YOU'LL GET ADDICTED*********  Their food is simple, yet very effective. I love all of the wraps.  10/10 would smash."
Cafe Réveille,This bustling cafe is great for a quick and easy breakfast/brunch. Their Shakshuka is quite nice as are most of the egg preparations as well as the bowls. I wish they’d lower their price point by $1-$2 per dish and I’d go here much more often.
Cafe Réveille,"Excellent if hipster-fawncy coffee shop / cafe; there's enough choice in food for them to correctly call it a cafe, but enough people just buying coffee that you have to include coffee shop.  The food is not cheap in any way, but otherwise it's a good place for your avocado toast or protein bowl or whatever.  Yes, they also have egg sandwiches, don't worry."
Cafe Réveille,Pastry selection is great. I didn't have their brunch but they look really nice. I had a latte. The flavor didn't stand out too much but it's very balanced and smooth. That's all you want for a latte :)
Cafe Réveille,"Food is good, kitchen staff very nice. However, servers are not friendly. Waited 50 minutes for one breakfast item."
Cafe Réveille,Food was only partially good- the breakfast burger and açaí bowl were delicious. The banana almond bread was not enjoyable at all because the bread was so hard I barely could cut nor bite it. Girls who took our order seemed  extremely snobby and bothered. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this cafe.
Cafe Réveille,Get the Levantine Sandwich with Chicken Thighs. Super delicious!  Coffees were fine not amazing. But pastries were also delicious we got the chocolate thing.  Be aware that their kitchen closes at 3pm so you won't be able to get food here after that.
Cafe Réveille,"Yummy espresso and pastries, with lots of seating"
Cafe Réveille,"Been here a few times since moving to the area. There's usually a line to order food, but it moves quickly. Table turnover is pretty quick as well, so don't worry if it looks crowded. Most of the time the food is great. Occasionally the food in the display is left out too long, but they can make it fresh if you ask."
Cafe Réveille,"Imagine the exclusivity of Blue Bottle, paired with delightful food options, in a bright and modern setting - Cafe Réveille in the Mission Bay neighborhood got what it takes the be in line for one of the top coffee places in the city.  I love the interior design, especially the well-designed coffee bar. Small tables and even an outdoor patio - extra space is needed as this place gets poppin', especially for brunch. And we know that San Franciscans like to brunch all day long.  First time I got here was on a Sunday when the nearby Starbucks on 3rd was closed. I mean, I don't necessarily need to pay #3.50 for my non-fancy cup of coffee but this place got me convinced I should."
Cafe Réveille,"Went for coffee/brunch with some friends. Picked the location because our usual haunts were likely to be overflowing that morning and it was situated about halfway between us. I'd been to the Castro location before and relatively pleased with it.  We showed up around 11:30 on a Saturday morning. There was a line, but it moved pretty quickly, and we were able to secure a table for 4 before our food and beverages were ready. Coffee was good, as was the food, and we were able to have a good chat while eating (i.e., it wasn't too loud or crowded).  I'd definitely go back and try some of the other offerings. I also noted the place was pretty family friendly (several families with young children present, and suitable facilities for such)."
Cafe Réveille,Fantastic cafe. Best acai bowl I've ever had in my life. The breakfast sandwich is also very tasty.
Cafe Réveille,"Good coffee, food and atmosphere. Really friendly staff."
Cafe Réveille,"Amazing breakfast place! Irresistible selection of pastries, great coffee and nice ambience. At the same time, this makes their lunch menu comparatively disappointing. Staff can also seem less than friendly and rather aloof at times."
Cafe Réveille,"When I work from home I usually head were to grab a latte and get on with work.  I've had several drinks and one of the pastries. My wife has had a few teas. We've both liked everything we've tried there.  The restrooms were originally equipped with mouthwash, which was great for combating coffee breath, but the last couple of times I've been there it has been absent.  I'm looking forward to trying the meals there."
Cafe Réveille,"What a lovely little cafe located in Mission Bay. I was visiting San Francisco and my brother lives in this new development. Their mocha was spot on and I dig the creative design with the foam. The morning bun with cheese and ham is crispy and satisfying. The mushroom hash was simple, but tasty. It was served sunny side up, so you can dip your toast in yolks. Yum! Service is friendly and attentive. If you do not like the loud music, one end of the cafe is quieter than the other. What a plus to the neighborhood."
Cafe Réveille,"For some reason the coffee is always served like warm - ask for an extra hot one. Other than that the coffee, teas, and food is awesome. Expect a long line and few open seats during peak hours. They get through the lines pretty quickly and food is also swift - so it’s only an issue with space. My favorites are the  Shakshuka, mushroom hash, and  açaí bowl"
Cafe Réveille,Great brunch place with gourmet coffee
Cafe Réveille,"Cool and laid back place, some chick, Carla I think it was. . .offered some of the best barista service, friendly & cheery! My boyfriend agrees. . .he got the best latte he's ever had. And I'm visiting from  LA, so it seems a lot more chill around here and that's a big deal. 😉 …"
Cafe Réveille,"The space is very modern and clean. However, the self serve water bar had a funny odor, almost of wet dog.  Service was friendly and quick.  Coffee and food was simple. If driving, parking is rare and hard to find."
Cafe Réveille,Rich coffee. They make a mean matcha latte too!
Cafe Réveille,"Great for dining in and coffee, terrible for to go! The food is delicious, if overpriced, and the coffee is always great. However, I have had more to go orders than I care to admit, especially considering the short time span reveille has been open, and every single time the order is wrong. I'll continue to go here in person, that way I can send it back if something is off. However, I'll never order anything to go from here ever again, other than the coffee."
Cafe Réveille,Busy part of San Fran. Brunch ends STRICTLY at 11:15 am. Missed it by 2 minutes. Lunch had some good options prices pretty high compared to other bigger cities. 3% extra charge for employees. Fries were okay. They were more on the harder side. Steak sandwich was medium. Very pink center. BLT has large thick bread pieces but very tastey. Chicken sandwich was very good. This place likes to serve thick carbs.
Cafe Réveille,"I came here with my friend one weekend to work on our laptops and chill at a coffee shop, but Cafe Reveille was more restaurant-y than I expected. While it was still okay to work (I saw a bunch of people doing this), I felt bad so I limited my time doing so. It's a nice place to just hang out in anyway, though it gets quite loud at times. The drinks here are fancy-ish and rich. I had a green tea latte, and my friend and I shared some of the hummus with pita as a snack.  One thing I particularly liked at this place was all the windows, letting in a lot of natural light. The location is great, especially for Mission Bay where I find the options for places to hang out are sometimes limited. The counter and table staff were friendly, although I found it difficult to get the attention of table staff (it was busy, but not thaaat busy)."
Cafe Réveille,"Not bad. But the good pastries are imported and thus upcharged, the breakfast sandwich we got was cold, and the coffee is expensive. If its a nice day and you have some time better going to spark social a couple blocks away."
Cafe Réveille,The coffee is great. The food is very tasty and well prepared.  The prices are San Francisco normal. They have limited seating for any group larger than 4.
Cafe Réveille,"Réveille may serve the best cappuccinos in town, and one can watch the staff roast their beans right in the middle of this beautiful contemporarily designed restaurant. Although it was a bit pricey, the breakfast food was tasty. Weekend brunch crowds are almost certain to materialize as the word gets out. Unfortunately, they intentionally do not offer WiFi (at this time), and there are no power outlets near any of the tables. Depending on one's perspective, that could be either a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it's a bad thing, and I docked the place one star because of it."
Cafe Réveille,"This place has good food generally, but they are reducing the quantity of the açaí bowl far too much. It does not justify the cost anymore.  I hope they fix this."
Cafe Réveille,"A favorite cafe.. own roasted beans, quality pastries,  comfy, friendly."
Cafe Réveille,"We were visiting the city and good coffee was a must! Since we tried blue bottle, I was ready for a new place. GMG posted about Cafe Reveille so we went to check it out on our last day. My matcha latte did not disappoint. The service was quick and friendly. The decor is on point! I hope to visit again one day."
Cafe Réveille,"It's a well loved coffee with top to floor windows that ensure tons of light, as well as long stream of aficionadas of their coffee. ★★★★★ Location: right off the busy office area of Mission Bay,   close to the Caltrain train station. ★★★★★ Ambience: great lighting, tons of space with mostly table for 2. ★★★☆☆ F&B: the coffee quality is great, albeit at a steep price (cappuccino go for $4, chai between 4-6) , but that's average for SF central area. Food wise it has room to be improved. Avocado are usually turning black. Almost no vegan options.  WIFI: provided albeit a bit slow. Music: trendy pop. Whilst seating there it was of the genre of Bruno Mars. Oulets: None WC: 2 clean"
Cafe Réveille,Absolutely grateful to have this cafe near me. They understand coffee and how it should be served. Best cappuccino I've had in SF area.
Cafe Réveille,"Cute cafe with a great atmosphere. They have Neighborhood bakery croissants, which are delicious. Coffee was great. The açaí bowl on the other hand was nothing to write home about."
Cafe Réveille,"A beautiful addition to mission bay! The interior is lovely and the espresso here is great. I ordered a macchiato, my friends ordered hot chocolate, cappuccino, and 3 breakfast sandwiches for us all. First - the espresso drinks here were perfection. I loved the taste of the espresso, and I tried the hot chocolate, which was indulgent but not too sweet. The breakfast sando was not impressing to me - the bread could have been toasted, and there was a lot of bread-to-stuff. At the end I was left with a third of my bread, which was good, but sort of dry and cold. The marguez lamb sausage was delicious, but it was really greasy and left a puddle oil on my plate. The sando also had a lot of aioli - I ended up scraping off a good bit. I did however enjoy how much avocado and greens was on the sandwich, and the display was pretty. I would definitely come again, but I do not recommend the breakfast sandwich."
Cafe Réveille,"Tried to come here for brunch but apparently it was over because all they had were some breakfast sandwiches wrapped in foil under a heat lamp. What they did have (chia bowls, juice, etc) was really delicious but super small and overpriced. I ate the chia bowl in three bites. Coffee was really good."
Cafe Réveille,"Great vibes and great food! Also, random — the bathroom is cool."
Cafe Réveille,"Well-made espresso drinks, excellent food, and freshly roasted beans. Nice folks working there, too."
Cafe Réveille,Loved the fish tacos I had for lunch.  They roast & brew a great coffee.  Deducted 1 star because the restaurant is dirty.  It's needs a good scrub.
Cafe Réveille,Great little spot with good food and decent coffee. Always busy but somehow there's always space.
Cafe Réveille,"Good coffee and pastries. But you need to wait for ages if you order a juice. We waited for 30min with the order number on our table. I asked about my order when they started to serve people who ordered after me, but they lost my order. I will not go there again. Bad service."
Cafe Réveille,"Note: I'm really picky about coffee. The latte and cappuccino are tasty, and they accept credit cards!  Lots of seating, which is generally open. This is a solid choice of coffee for the area, especially if you don't have any cash on you."
Cafe Réveille,The interior feels very modern and urban. The coffee is excellent. The service was friendly and prompt. The only concern is the constant line on the weekends. I suppose it's a good problem to have since it means the products are popular.
Cafe Réveille,Well-lit and pleasant ambience -- one of my favorite reading/working neighborhood cafes. Coffee is delicious; iced latte is beautiful. Matcha latte had a bit of a fishy taste (not sure why).
Cafe Réveille,Lovely ambiance and decent service. Unfortunately I felt their cortado fell a little short. The shot pulled was overly acidic and a bit astringent. I thought the milk was a bit too cold as well.
Cafe Réveille,Sf has trend of very light roasting coffee. This results in sour green coffee and any self respecting Italian would avoid. This location cute as it may be roasts their coffee such that it tastes like vinegar and at $3.25 a shot simply is a pass imho
Cafe Réveille,Friendly staff and the matcha latte I ordered was great! Only giving 4 stars because there are no outlets to plug electronics.
Cafe Réveille,"I'm really disappointed with the new menu. I always came here for the shakshuka which was the best shakshuka I've had, but they just changed the menu and the new shakshuka is terrible. They took out the chickpeas and bread from the dish, and added in a whole bunch of salt! The bread was the best part of the dish, the chickpeas added substance, and now it's sickeningly salty. I've never heard of serving shakshuka without bread/pita. Also, the poached eggs were over cooked, and somehow the yolks were tiny... very odd. So sad to never have their old shakshuka again. Two stars because their coffee is still good, but that's not enough to bring me back."
Cafe Réveille,Great spot for a great coffee and fresh  breakfast/lunch options. I will be returning!
Cafe Réveille,just okay. got the dirty chai and wouldn’t get it again. nice space though
Cafe Réveille,On point espresso and the roaster is very friendly. Great guy to nerd out with on the finer points of roasting and it's science.  Great atmosphere as well. +1 for the always cute baristas
Cafe Réveille,"Beautiful interior, pleasant service, mighty expensive and avoid the croissants- look great but totally lacking in taste and texture. Nice table seating outside"
Cafe Réveille,Excellent matcha latte and açaí bowls.
Cafe Réveille,"Pissy counter service but other than that, this place deserves your business. Well prepared food at a reasonable price. Solid coffee. Stylish setting. Bus boys kick ass"
Cafe Réveille,"Food and coffee are good, though on the pricier side. They have amazingly fast WiFi, which makes this place great for work. If you can find a seat, that is."
Cafe Réveille,"Great coffee, tea and pastries, fresh squeezed juices! Also, a variety of healthy, freshly made dishes and appetizers, some vegan options and a great breakfast menu too!"
Cafe Réveille,"Great coffee, ambience, and food options. I love the breakfast sandwich o the weekends!"
Cafe Réveille,The breakfast treats look delicious and got raves from our party. Good for and well situated seating make this a great place to grab a cup of joe.
Cafe Réveille,"They just don't know how to handle a rush here during busy times. Never got my food. Was told ""just 20 more seconds"" after inquiring politely. Still nothing. Just didn't have time to wait around and harass them to get around to it. Had to leave without receiving what I paid for."
Cafe Réveille,Cafe Reveille makes a hot sauce that makes me wonder if they made a deal with the devil-- it's that good and I love hot sauces. The rest of their menu is delicious and the service is always top-notch.
Cafe Réveille,All-time favorite coffee shop. I love coming here for amazing iced coffee and maybe even a grilled chicken sandwich
Cafe Réveille,"Initially went in to grab a quick coffee before a lunch date - saw the food menu and called and audible and ate here. Food is healthy, kitchen is quick and the portions are substantial."
Cafe Réveille,Delicious coffee and delightful juices. Beautiful interior with chill vibe. The turmeric shot is a burst flavor and frothiness.
Cafe Réveille,"One of the best roasters in SF. The china basin location is open and airy. Also, they serve neighbor bakery goods which are fantastic"
Cafe Réveille,Excellent brunch offering. Well cooked. Ate takeaway outside with young children. A tad cool.
Cafe Réveille,"8-10$ for a standard sized smoothie is pretty pricey, but their ingredients are nice. Pretty good chilaquiles too!"
Cafe Réveille,"I lived close by. When they first open it was great and I""m so glad we have coffee shop open. But after a few months somehow quality went down drastically and I no longer want to go there."
Cafe Réveille,"Bustling neighborhood spot, with great selection of pastries in the morning and a fun lunch menu - their kitchen is top notch! Oh, and the coffee is great too!"
Cafe Réveille,Good food and a nice atmosphere
Cafe Réveille,"Long line for food, but you can sit outside which is lovely. There was not a lot of space inside on a weekday afternoon. Coffee was good."
Cafe Réveille,Do yourself a favor this wknd and make brunch plans at Cafe Réveille. 🥞 One of my favorite neighborhood cafes with super yummy brekkie without a long wait. …
Cafe Réveille,Amazing coffee. Some of the best espresso in the city. Really enjoyed the pastries and the breakfasts were great.
Cafe Réveille,Cool place... delicious blueberries pistachios croissant!
Cafe Réveille,My friend dealt with a ridiculously rude barista here earlier today. Will never be going back and supporting a place that delivers terrible customer service & overpriced selections.
Cafe Réveille,Very attractive Cafe with outstanding coffee and Pastries.
Cafe Réveille,"A little pricey, but really good. Vanilla latte with vegetarian breakfast sandwich was delicious."
Cafe Réveille,Went by to get coffee at 4:45 and they were closed in preparation for a dinner service.  The name is a bit misleading.  I would expect a coffee place to be open at that time and serving coffee to go.  Oh well.  I will update my star rating after I've had a chance to actually try their goods.
Cafe Réveille,"Excellent coffee and food, great for brunch and for working for a few hours."
Cafe Réveille,"Great breakfast items, pastries and freshly roasted coffee."
Cafe Réveille,"Great food. But no table service (ordering), detracts from the experience. Also prices were a bit on the high end."
Cafe Réveille,"I come here all the time purely for convenience.  The gem here is the Açaí bowl. Get it to go. I swear the portions are getting smaller and smaller, unless it’s in their to go box."
Cafe Réveille,Used to love this place but probably won’t be returning. They got rid of everything good on their menu. Seems like they are trying to hard. Food wasn’t good.
Cafe Réveille,"Lunch is great. Highly recommend the salad. Coffee here is pricey but not so great, just walk down the street to Phil's."
Cafe Réveille,"You can get coffee and pastry, and full breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. Great little place to stage an early escape from work for a glass of wine."
Cafe Réveille,"Hands down the best coffee, perhaps the only passable coffee, in mission bay. I'm also a fan of their hibiscus iced tea in the afternoons."
Cafe Réveille,"Visited for brunch, overall food quality is good but too less quantity and exoensive. Meal for 2 can cost upto 50 bucks"
Cafe Réveille,Nice space but pretty bland coffee without any real depth to the espresso. Conveniently located. Nice staff.
Cafe Réveille,"Americano is so great and perfect~ Only one thing is....NOT coffee-related, which is NO electric outlets....my laptop is out of juice...but no way to recharge ~"
Cafe Réveille,"Great coffee, I also like the avocado toast and the salad bowl."
Cafe Réveille,But little coffee shop in mission bay. Tried the cappuccino and it was made to perfection. Friendly staff and nice place to sit.
Cafe Réveille,Yummy coffee and pastries and a great place to get some work done and do some people watching.  My only complaint is that they don’t have outlets
Cafe Réveille,"Good, slightly more interesting than normal breakfast, for slightly higher than normal prices. Good espresso most days."
Cafe Réveille,"Customer service is the worst! All the employees ESPECIALLY the girls at the register seem like they are being forced to work there and have the longest mean faces ever, Wow very sad to have walked in to this place, never again!"
Cafe Réveille,Great breakfast menu and awesome cold brew. My only suggestion is to make the ice coffee to go bigger.

Cafe Réveille,"Limited menu but good food (had basic eggs, bacon, potatos) and decent pricing (<$20)"
