Equator Coffees,Espresso is smooth and not bitter!! I got the brainwash latte with oatmilk & caramel. It was very good. Not too sweet if that’s what you’re looking for. The glass all around the cafe is beautiful to look out.
Equator Coffees,"Great atmosphere, helpful staff and good music in the cafe. All the staff seemed to have a good time with each other. Great coffee and snacks (maple scone and banana toast). Needless to say the view is also priceless."
Equator Coffees,Amazing ambience! The view from the cafe is very pretty. The baristas were a little slow so our first two coffees were cold by the time we got them while the last one prepared was perfect temperature.
Equator Coffees,Great cafe with an amazing view of the bridge and ocean. It’s quite a serene cafe location though weekends can get super busy but worth the visit. Must try the everything croissant and special pour over blends.
Equator Coffees,"Finally found the cafe shop serves Matcha Latte without sugar, it’s pretty nice.Turkey panini also good, it a little bit small can’t full stomach but it’s tasty. Good view, good service. The reason why I give 4 stars because the food portion size is not quite sufficient, not equal to the prize."
Equator Coffees,"Walking across the Golden Gate Bridge sure builds an appetite. The Round House Cafe offers plenty of snacks to keep you on your feet. They have pastries, coffee, gelato and paninis. The EQ Ultimate Sub was an awesome first pick. Thank you."
Equator Coffees,"There was a line to place an order. Place had a nice atmosphere. Friendly staff, Asa was great, friendly, and our lattes were on point!!! Place could be a bit cleaner, but they were so busy!!!"
Equator Coffees,The coffee and view are amazing. The staff is friendly but slow. The lone was wrapped around the whole cafe.  The merchandise was not marked with the price so I didn't get it as I didn't want to wait in line again for nothing. Very limited parking so get ready to walk!
Equator Coffees,"A must-stop if you are in the area! Very affordable price, fast service, good food! And the best view of the Golden Gate Bridge! No public restrooms so do your business near the visitor center before coming :)"
Equator Coffees,"We stopped by just craving for a coffee and found this little café just on the south side of the Golden Gate Bridge at the visitor center. The view is amazing and if you want to stay to enjoy your coffee while overlooking the golden gate bride and Alcatraz it is the spot to be. The coffee is definitely ok as well, even though the americano was on the weak side. At least they know how to brew coffee and they have the proper equipment to do so. The cortado on the other hand was spot on👍🏻"
Equator Coffees,My ham and cheese croissant was given to someone else who ordered a vegetarian one. They took a bite out of it and then there were no more for them to give me one. They also gave me the wrong latte and when I asked about it they told me the milk tastes sweet when you heat the milk right. I swapped with my friend as I hate sweet coffee (we ordered the same drink) which confirmed they gave me the wrong coffee as hers was a regular latte (what I ordered). Requested a refund for my croissant which I didn’t receive and was told that it would be processed by the end of the day. I guess I just have to trust they’ll do it. Definitely didn’t deserve the tip I gave. If I had known I was getting nothing of what I ordered they wouldn’t have gotten a tip from me. I don’t understand tipping before a service is completed because this is the perfect example of this USA tipping system not working. Disappointing.
Equator Coffees,"Hello Alanna,  Thank you for visiting our cafe and for taking the time share your feedback.  We want everyone who visits our cafe to have a wonderful experience and in this instance we fell short of that goal.  I want to personally apologize and invite you back to any cafe for a beverage on us.  I hope that you will consider giving us a second chance.  If this is something that you would like to do, please let me know.  You can reach me directly at tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com.  Again, I'm really sorry.  Sincerely, Tina Malouf"
Equator Coffees,Well positioned for enjoyment while sitting outside the bridge and their drinks and food were tasty too.  It seemed like the place was busy but didn't feel packed if you were sitting by the window.
Equator Coffees,"Great views of the Golden Gate Bridge even on a foggy day, very reasonably priced food and drinks."
Equator Coffees,"I was a bit skeptical about this place because its on a very touristy place and it could be very expensive and could offer only fast food - but! What a pleasant surprise! Most of the options are super healthy, also Vegan options and prices are quite reasonable for the position. I was so happy to get their vegetarian bowl after a long walk."
Equator Coffees,Great spot to have a coffee or a snack and enjoy the Golden Gate Bridge view. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting.
Equator Coffees,"One of the best breakfasts with the view we have had in a while. The coffee, food, service, view were all excellent! Not too many people, surprisingly. Highly recommend!"
Equator Coffees,Great prices and decent seating area. Food was good and there’s good views of the bridge from the store while you eat.
Equator Coffees,"$10 for an 8oz cappuccino & an orange juice,not bed, friendly service, and the Best view ever at Golden gate bridge."
Equator Coffees,"It’s a busy cafe where you can drink and eat something with a nice view to the Golden Gate Bridge. The seatings near the glass are difficult to get on rush hours. It’s a busy coffee place and sometimes  some itens go out of stock, when I was there for example they run out of croissants. Prices are ok for such a touristic spot."
Equator Coffees,Very delicious sandwiches. EQ ULTIMATE was a 10.
Equator Coffees,"Great view, good food, friendly staff and bilingual  always a + on a turistic spot."
Equator Coffees,Wonderful coffee and priceless views of the golden gate bridge. No restrooms available at the cafe...but you can walk a few steps and public restrooms available near the visitor center.
Equator Coffees,Delicious latte. Excellent sandwich. Great location with an awesome view.
Equator Coffees,Nice spot. Great snacks. Prices are decent and you have a great view of the bridge.
Equator Coffees,"The have amazing fikka buns, and the latté was outstanding!"
Equator Coffees,"Expensive, personnel really friendly and the best view to eat a sandwich."
Equator Coffees,"A little expensive for such small portions, relatively fast, amazing view. That’s about it. Wouldn’t recommend getting coffee before the bridge, get it after."
Equator Coffees,"Fantastic coffee with an unbeatable view of the Golden Gate Bridge, a big selection of food to choose from too which I unfortunately had no time to try! A great stopping point if you’re walking the bridge or the trails around it."
Equator Coffees,Grilled cheese was fairly priced and tasty. Coffee was excellent and matched with a stunning view of the bridge. Limited gluten free options available.
Equator Coffees,Makes waiting for friends before a bike ride pleasurable. Recommend the espresso if your pregaming a bike ride. Comes with sparkling water.
Equator Coffees,"Great pumpkin spice latte made with ACTUAL pumpkin puree. Certain chains should take note. Would have enjoyed the view but the bridge was covered in fog when we went, but I can imagine it’s a great lookout point. Only thing was they did seem to take ages- there was a constant massive queue and I saw one customer join with a soft drink, and after a while he gave up- but the staff were friendly. Prices are roughly what you expect at this location."
Equator Coffees,"the hot cocoa here is really, really good. friendly baristas and a lovely view of the bridge, as well"
Equator Coffees,Great views! I highly recommend taking public transport to get here.  The menu was limited.  The taste of food and speed of service was excellent.  The food is overpriced as expected for a tourist spot.
Equator Coffees,It’s the only coffee shop in this area. Not bad.
Equator Coffees,Beautiful view and HIGH quality coffee which was much appreciated. Fun latte options I got the Habibi and sat to draw the bridge on a few hour laterover in SFO 💖 …
Equator Coffees,Staff was friendly and food was good (though a bit pricey) View is great
Equator Coffees,"The workers are lovely, the coffee is good and the view is great. Busy but nothing to complain really"
Equator Coffees,Coffee shop with the best view of Golden Gate Bridge
Equator Coffees,"A small cafe fulfilling everyday requirements like a coffee shot or/and a snack.  Barstools placed right against the windows overlooking the Bridge and the Bay—brew with a view!  Despite the cafe being super busy on a Sunday noon, the coffee was delivered pretty rapidly.  PS- No restrooms inside this cafe. Public restrooms can be tracked right across the street.  #Day1 #SFO"
Equator Coffees,"It's alright! Great after a hike & walk across the street, service is quick and simple. There's not enough seats, and the ones that are there aren't too comfy.  However the drinks and food are good, so can't complain too much."
Equator Coffees,"At the top of golden gate park just before the Golden Gate Bridge.  You can get a view, a coffee and a muffin before that long bridge walk lol"
Equator Coffees,"Stopped here for a cup of coffee and panini after walking the Golden Gate bridge. Good place to relax and take in the sights. The wait wasn't too long but it's a bit pricey (where in San Francisco isn't 😆), and seating is somewhat limited relative to the number of people that come in there."
Equator Coffees,Beauty spot. Outstanding espresso. The barrista knows what she's doing. The view is amazing. Super busy spot but service was prompt. Thanks for a great coffee on a day of exploring
Equator Coffees,Bad service. Rude staff. Only got half our order and had to beg for the rest of it which we didn’t get till we were nearly done with our food. Over priced and not really very good. Muffins are dry and the breads are as well. Save your cash and go to the presidio for food! So very disappointed. We love trying different places. This one was not the quality it should have been being directly in the bridge park.
Equator Coffees,"Hello Thelma, Let me start by apologizing for your experience.  We understand how important it is to give great service and kindness is one of the values we hold most dearly at Equator.  I'm not sure what happened on your visit, but I assure you, I will look into the matter and follow-up with the team.  I hope that you will consider giving us another try and I would like to invite you back to one of our cafes for a beverage on us.  Please reach out to me directly and we can figure out how best to achieve this. Again, I'm really sorry about your visit and hope to hear back from you. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,"Really busy location, line moved fairly fast.  Service was friendly.  Benches surrounding the exterior and interior chairs available.  Had the prosciutto panini, the ingredients used complemented the meat nicely and did not overpower the flavor of the meat.  Good bread."
Equator Coffees,Great little Cafe with views of the bridge. The heart impeded in the glass makes for an interesting picture!
Equator Coffees,It's a tourist spot with tourist food.
Equator Coffees,"Everyone was very helpful and friendly. We had walked the bridge found trip and loved the club sandwich and iced espresso shots.  The club sandwich had sliced avocado, ham etc,. The crusty bread was an ideal match."
Equator Coffees,Amazing coffee with amazing staff and amazing view. Recommend the Habibi coffee. This is a must stop if you are here
Equator Coffees,"It is a good and secret place to have a lunch and being comfortable to see the Golden Gate Bridge! The waitress here is friendly! Here is also food for vegetarians!(just see the pictures) Also, you can change milk to soy milk for just extra $0.5. It is really friendly to vegetarians and nice for sightseeing as well. Highly recommend to you! :)"
Equator Coffees,Loved the experience. Great sandwiches and tasty coffee. The location is fantastic after a walk on the Golden Gate Bridge. What more can be said.
Equator Coffees,Yay! It’s Equator now. Good meet up point for cyclists pre ride to get that caffeine in.
Equator Coffees,"Good food, a bit noisy but it's all good."
Equator Coffees,"Great coffee located right at the Golden Gate bridge. I had the maple walnut latte iced and it was amazing, as well as the maple scone. So good!"
Equator Coffees,Great views. Great food..fair prices
Equator Coffees,"The guy at the cashier was pretty rude to me when i was ordering food. I got a Cheese Panini (I think thats what its called sorry)  a medium hot coffee, and an avocado toast. (I was pretty hyped about this place because i am vegetarian and i was so happy to see all these vegetarian options!) But when I got my Grilled cheese Panini , the cheese was pretty disgusting in my opinion. but the coffee and avocado Toast were really good. And at the end for dessert I got a Dark Chocolate gelato bar and it was BOMB, so good that was probably my favorite thing that I got. So i wouldn't say this place is all bad but it could use some improvements :)"
Equator Coffees,"Good morning, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.  One of our core values at Equator is kindness, so I am very disappointed to hear that our cafe may have been rude.  I'm hoping  that you will reach out to me directly and provide me with some additional details about your visit, so that I can follow-up with the team.  I would also like additional information about the grilled cheese and specifically, what we could have done better.  I would be more than happy to put aside a free drink token for your next visit to one of our cafes.  Again, I really appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback and I'm sorry that we didn't meet your expectations.  I hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,I went to this place on a cold and windy day. Cocoa here gave us life. It was like a small resting place selling light snacks and drinks.
Equator Coffees,Waited in line just to learn that the espresso machine is already turned off at 4.25pm. Closing time is 5pm. Please make it clear for your customers before they get in line that coffee choices are limited to drip coffee half an hour prior closing.
Equator Coffees,"Hello Victoria,  Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.  I'd like to personally apologize for your experience at our cafe.  We've been working really hard to ensure that we have enough staff to provide great service for our customers, but unfortunately we were running short during your visit.  Our team made the call to close the espresso machine early and should have been communicating this to the customers.  Again, I'm really sorry.  Will you be visiting one of our cafes anytime soon?  I'd be more than happy to put aside a free drink token for your next visit.  You can reach out to me directly to get this setup.    Again, really sorry.  Hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,Nice view of the bridge. Food is a little expensive for its quality
Equator Coffees,"After walking back-and-forth across the bridge, warm up with chili and treat yourself to an oatmeal cookie! The food is good and not terribly over-priced. The view of the bridge while eating is exquisite!"
Equator Coffees,Very friendly staff and very good food. Makes the walk to the golden gate bridge even more worth it !
Equator Coffees,Good tasting drinks with a great view. I got the fog mocha and really enjoyed the crunchy chocolate bits. It's a bit pricey but it's a good view.
Equator Coffees,Great coffee with amazing views 👌🏼
Equator Coffees,Prime spot for the tourists.
Equator Coffees,"Very limited selection, but had a good chili dog. The view is worth it."
Equator Coffees,"Had multiple excellent coffees, real good pricing for this touristic spot too. Lovely helpful ladies at the counter and a stunning view from the terrace!"
Equator Coffees,"The view is of extraordinary magnitude. Great view of the Golden gate bridge, Alcatraz or San Francisco or all at the same time"
Equator Coffees,"Customer service is not good. They know that there's no other option for visitors and thus making a monopoly out of that. I purchased a coffee and after sipping realised that it was barely warm and not hot. I told the lady in the service desk that the coffee is not hot, she was rude and replied that ""this is the hottest coffee we make"". My 3$ was a waste."
Equator Coffees,Good coffee break spot! Grilled cheese was perfect! Prices are alright! Atmosphere is clean and very modern.
Equator Coffees,"Great coffee, helpful staff and the cutest Golden Gate Bridge cookies..."
Equator Coffees,"Terrible chai tea latte from here.  The servers were okay but the chai tea was terrible I must say. Absolutely they do not have any idea about tea, I must say, coming with a background of 30+ years of having tea. I can clearly say it was not worth the money.  *STAY AWAY FROM TEA here.  I gave them the feedback directly too.  They have a monopoly as no store is in its vicinity so can’t help much."
Equator Coffees,Over priced food here with very limited options I would go back to the city if you want to eat.
Equator Coffees,"Had a good coffee and a nice grain bowl here. Staff is very friendly and while there’s no seating inside, there’s plenty of benches etc overlooking the bridge just outside. Highly recommend this spot!"
Equator Coffees,Can't beat the location for sure but the items are REALLY overpriced. I desperately needed a drink after a very long walk and I paid an ungodly price for a small bottle of water. Still better than dying of thirst I suppose
Equator Coffees,"Hello,  I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for visiting our cafe and for providing us with your feedback.  I'm sorry to hear that you felt our water was overpriced.  We work very hard to keep our prices reasonable and approachable for all people.  Additionally, we are always happy to get someone a glass of water and we have a water station in the cafe for folks to fill up their own water bottles.  I'd be happy to invite you back for a beverage on us.  If this is something that you would like, please let me know. Again, thanks for visiting our cafe and I hope to hear back from you. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,Great coffee!!! I love peanut butter cookie 😋 …
Equator Coffees,**Pokémon Go Recommend** Beautiful sights. Delicious coffee. Respect the loction and time when its busy. Recommend to anyone who loves coffee and a good sight.  **Trainers Take over the Golden Gate Bridge and enjoy a Espresso here while your at is the education here is awesome to learn about while your catching all the pokémon around you.
Equator Coffees,"I ordered a hot chocolate that wasn't hot when I received it despite asking for it extra hot. However, when I informed them it wasn't hot they immediately used a thermometer to measure the temperatue and then made me a new one which was delicious!"
Equator Coffees,"There are plenty of great cafes to get your caffeine fix in Burlingame. If you're looking for something with a more unique flavor, head over the Equator Coffee outlets on Solo Street or stop by one its cafes located at Fort Mason before grabbing an espresso drink near The Bay Bridge during rush hour traffic!"
Equator Coffees,"Great place to grab a cup of coffee or a sandwich and take in a fantastic view of the bridge. Don’t skip, time your walk to bridge to include a stop here."
Equator Coffees,The freshest purest quality coffee you can just taste  how 100% natural it is from the coffee down to the creamer. Lots of space to view the bridge also.
Equator Coffees,Beautiful view but way too expensive for what I got. Staff is poorly trained and a little rude sometimes. Not a great experience and the only redemption point is the view and the location.
Equator Coffees,Excellent service and quickly made lunch. Delicious avocado toast. Such a pleasure to support a local business here at GGB.
Equator Coffees,Nice coffee shop and strategically located
Equator Coffees,Better to look at than to eat at.
Equator Coffees,"A fabulous new addition to the equator family of cafes though the Bay Area! It’s a great place to meet up with friends before an epic scenic adventure. The coffee, chai and food are all standout! I’m addicted this place!  Cheers, Damien Mccloud SpinOut Fitness"
Equator Coffees,Delicious coffee ☕ and excellent 👌👍 costumer service I would recommend this place …
Equator Coffees,"I'm typically a die-hard Equator fan, but this location should be open earlier to actually be considered a functional stop on weekdays. There's tons of foot/bike traffic on the bridge early in the morning that should be taken advantage of, both recreational riders, commuters, and people out for a morning stroll/run."
Equator Coffees,Decent variety if food for a quick rest after hiking across the Golden Gate Bridge! Yummy hot chocolate! Cool view from seats! Friendly staff!
Equator Coffees,"Other than the location and view this place is terrible! When placing our order the person who took our order did not listen. When we went to get our order I looked at our receipt and I saw it was incorrect. Two staff members were incredibly rude, yelled at me and said it wasn’t their problem then walked away. They could careless about customer service and the drinks are worse than a gas station self service hot chocolate machine. Don’t waste your time or your money on this business and the people they employ."
Equator Coffees,"Amazing update by Equator Coffees to this iconic cafe, no better view for a cup of great coffee and friendly staff!"
Equator Coffees,It was nice to stop in grab some water and coffee and a snack  As well as have a place to sit down after visiting.
Equator Coffees,Line was super long on the weekend and only one cashier.. needs to be better managed given the location and crowds needs.  Cashier had a bad attitude.
Equator Coffees,I like this place it's so clean and the pepple are really adorable
Equator Coffees,Food was delicious and views of the bridge was great! Try the hot chocolate...so gooood!
Equator Coffees,We went for lunch here bèfore walking across the bridge. The interior of the cafe could do with an update but the chicken club sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. A very good portion and delicious. Was a little pricey but that's to be expected I guess at such a popular tourist attraction. Please get the club if you go!
Equator Coffees,Amazing hot chocolate with a great view
Equator Coffees,Small menu. But what a view.
Equator Coffees,The club sandwich was absolutely divine and very filling. Friendly and efficient service and the cafe was spotlessly clean. Very good.
Equator Coffees,Good hot chocolate but beside that not so great. The place was also quite dirty.
Equator Coffees,"Great place to grab a bite either before or after going on the Golden Gate Bridge (only walking, not car accessible if you want to go on the bridge right after)."
Equator Coffees,A good viewpoint
Equator Coffees,"It's extremely small and a quaint place, the views are gorgeous towards the water and the Golden Gate Bridge, I'll be sure to stop by on my next visit out there again"
Equator Coffees,"Hot dogs where decent but the choice is really limited and the service is meh. The view is absolutely splendid though, kind of a shame it's the only place to eat around Golden Gate Bridge."
Equator Coffees,Good place for a quick bite with very good view of the Golden gate bridge.
Equator Coffees,"I just bought a bottle of water here and I haven't left any tips, because I am not served. Later I realized on my statement the cashier put 20% extra on the charge. Definitely not recommend."
Equator Coffees,Friendly and good taste!
Equator Coffees,Food is good and you can get a great view of the Golden gate bridge. We went on a Sunday and we're able to get a seat by the window pretty quickly.
Equator Coffees,Hot chocolate was cold when it was served but staff was very nice and reheated it . Otherwise cute spot
Equator Coffees,Awesome view Very very limited food choices
Equator Coffees,Great views and 360 viewing from the restaurant. They have basic sandwiches and American fare that can be considered overpriced so just order light and enjoy the climate controlled indoors and a drink while taking a break from walking.
Equator Coffees,Nice comfort food after a tiring walk across the bridge.
Equator Coffees,"Good for a quick lunch after walking across the bridge.  I had the Chilly dog, which was really good.  I also ordered a cola, and was given a can of Coca-cola Life.  I didn't mind, since I actually like that version, but it would have been nice to know in advance."
Equator Coffees,Excellent coffee but better be patient ! The only coffee around this touristic place !!
Equator Coffees,"Cozy food and drinks, worth the price to hold something warm and tasty on the foggy GGB."
Equator Coffees,Great place for lunch and coffee before or after your hike across the Golden Gate Bridge
Equator Coffees,Beautiful views and delicious food. Hard to find a seat inside but plenty of different seats outdoors!
Equator Coffees,"WORST cafe I have ever been. No charging, no heating, rude workers, only 2 types of cookies served, hot cocoa with so little chocolate. These are the things you would expect after a rainy walk across and back, especially since there are no other cafes on the north side. Could have been so much more. The potential of that place is so high with its magnificient view that it is depressing to see such a bad service overall"
Equator Coffees,Great location for coffee or a snack at the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Equator Coffees,A beautiful place to grab a delicious bite to eat and enjoy the view of the Golden Gate Bridge!
Equator Coffees,Surprisingly great pastries Great service
Equator Coffees,Coffee wasn't very good and a waiter was smug and rude asking for tips when completely messing up our order
Equator Coffees,"Very disappointing experience with this establishment. I have always loved Equator Coffee (it’s my favorite in California) so I had high hopes for visiting this location. However, after entering the building, an employee said they were closed and refused to let me buy a coffee—even though the sign said “Open,” Google Maps said they would be open for another hour, the doors were unlocked, and they had JUST sold a coffee to someone who entered seconds before me. Why did they discriminate against me in this situation? It was VERY disappointing, and I don’t know if I will ever be back. Please address this behavior, Equator."
Equator Coffees,Drinking my coffee and eating breakfast while directly viewing golden gate bridge and Alcatraz - loved it.
Equator Coffees,The chill hot dog was great after the round trip walking the bridge and the hot chocolate when it was cold
Equator Coffees,"Good coffee, but bad hours. Open at a reasonable time like every other coffee shop in the city!"
Equator Coffees,"Ordered a latte, got hot milk instead. Avoid"
Equator Coffees,Only two employees while there is 100 customer !! Simple hot americano took me 50 min to get 😞 …
Equator Coffees,Si bad service to expensive and so slowly. I do not recomend to grt here
Equator Coffees,My sandwich was like a mouthful of string drenched with salt. If you're on vacation skip this garbage and try any of the thousands of great local restaurants in San Francisco.
Equator Coffees,Cute art deco coffee shop with great view of bridge.
Equator Coffees,Have food with scenic view of Golden gate bridge . This shop is not that big so expect delay in getting your food and place to sit.
Equator Coffees,"I got a sandwich while I was here. They didn't have the biggest selection but it was enough. I realize this is mostly a place for tourists to grab a bite to eat while visiting the Golden Gate Bridge. It was good and the employees knew how to deal with a crowd. It was all girls and one guy when I was there, and seemed like he was new. It seemed like he was figuring it out. They carried the load though. The design of building is awesome and the views are great. It was a good meal after a long walk over the bridge and finding a spot to take some pictures on the cliffs over looking the Golden Gate. I plan on visiting again."
Equator Coffees,Good place for some post run recharge!
Equator Coffees,"Drinks are OK, but awesome view of the bridge"
Equator Coffees,"walked all the way from baker beach and stopped here for lunch and rest before crossing over to sausalito. didnt expect much but i enjoyed my ultimate club sandwich, brownie and hot chocolate in a cold day.  saw some bad comments about staff but i find them active and efficient.  The place’s always full around noon time but i didn’t hv to wait too long for my food."
Equator Coffees,"Beautiful location. No indoor seating currently, but some nice benches outside."
Equator Coffees,"The most horrible customer service ever in the Us. I Have to leave, ask for some ice cubes to warm my coffee and the answe was ""NO, if u want some ice u should have ask when u paid"". Seriously???"
Equator Coffees,"Overpriced, understaffed, very poor service. Stay away!"
Equator Coffees,Delicious Coffee and sandwiches and a wonderful location at the Golden Gate Bridge!! 🙂🙂👏👏
Equator Coffees,Online ordering is unavailable and their phone number doesn’t work??
Equator Coffees,"Hello Veronica, Thank you for being a dedicated customer and for sharing your feedback about our online orders and phone number.  I tried to give the cafe a call after your message and I couldn't get through.  We are looking into this issue and will get it resolved.  As for online ordering, I was able to access our online orders.  Did you try ordering via the app or web?  Either way, we are sorry for any frustration this may have caused and hope that you will come see us again.  I would be happy to put aside a free drink token for your next visit.  If this is something that you'd like, please let me know.  Again, really sorry and appreciate the feedback. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,Very slow service and the wrong things served. Plus the coffee was mediocre
Equator Coffees,"Hello Kartik, Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear about your experience and a bit surprised as we had positive feedback from other guests today that drinks came out on time. Did anyone at the register communicate the anticipated wait time for your order or provide you with any updates?  Please note that wait times can get very long during weekends because we have a significant amount of guests visiting the cafe.  We've been working really hard to ensure that our staffing meets the needs of the business, but given the current state of hiring, it has been really challenging to achieve.  In order to ensure our guests have a great experience we will continue to strive to provide more accurate wait times at the register, so our customers know what to expect.  Again, I'm really sorry and would like the opportunity to make it up to you.  Please reach out to me directly and we can make it happen. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,Super inconvenient hours. I was here around 5pm and they were already closed. Had to starve until i caught the bus back to a more populated area :/
Equator Coffees,A place for tourist to take a bite and rest. But quite expensive.
Equator Coffees,Great espresso drinks and iced tea!  The best views of the Golden Gate Bridge while warming up with one of their signature drinks. My local friends say they are well known for great cookies!  I always stop here on my way out of town for a sandwich or cup of soup.
Equator Coffees,"Quick and there when we were hungry. I got the green chile egg burrito and it tasted yummy, but was cold in the middle, so obviously a pre-made and warmed up item. My husband got a hot dog, which was fine. View and location are amazing. Had to catch seats when other people left, since the only chairs are along the window."
Equator Coffees,The chili bread bowl was decent but the view was beautiful.
Equator Coffees,Not too much to pick from.  Not really a cafe at all.
Equator Coffees,"The cafe is not anything fancy and with expensive price however it looking over the golden gate bridge, i guess they have every reason to be expensive 😂 …"
Equator Coffees,Ordered focacia bread with roasted veggie; after payment they said ran out of it and will make sandwitch instead. i asked will it be warm n filling like that n they lied and 20 min gave me worst cold smallest sandwitch of my life -LIARS!!!
Equator Coffees,Lovely view of the bridge 😊 a little expensive though …
Equator Coffees,Beautiful Views!  Great Location
Equator Coffees,"Expensive, noisy, and smells like pee. Good views though."
Equator Coffees,Better to look at than to eat at :(
Equator Coffees,Quick snacks and drinks.  Nothing to scream about
Equator Coffees,Avoid eatting here! It's awful.
Equator Coffees,Smelled like sewage. Bought a water because it was hot
Equator Coffees,Painfully expensive. They charge tips without asking amount
Equator Coffees,"Usually crowded, a great view, though."
Equator Coffees,"Round House Cafe also known as Bridge Cafe is situated right in the center of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. This cafe welcomes the visitors around the Bridge area and remains open from morning breakfast hours till late evening times. The cafe is right next to the main Bridge freeway and near to the turning roads around Bridge area. On climbing the stairs from the ground area one'd directly make it to the cafe's main enterance. They serve variety of Coffess along with scrumptious sacks, this is a place to stop by to fulfill some short hungers during the visit to super awesome Golden Gate Bridge."

Equator Coffees,Miserable checkout staff. Tourist trap.
Equator Coffees,"Hello Simon, Thank you for visiting our cafe and for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.  I was very disappointed to read that you felt our staff was miserable because they are all kind and passionate individuals.  Sometimes the high volume of traffic can be a little stressful for the team.  Maybe that caused the team to seem unhappy.  I hope that you will come back and visit us again and I would be happy to provide a free beverage on us.  If this is something that you would like, please let me now.  Again, I'm really sorry. Sincerely. Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"
Equator Coffees,Turkey Panini was great!
Equator Coffees,Great coffee!
Equator Coffees,Was charged 20% tips WITHOUT my permission. Cheating!
Equator Coffees,"Made an amateur mistake not writing amounts for tips and total amount, and got charged 20% after tax. When questioning the staff at the counter, the waiter there pointed me without saying a word to a tiny red notice sticked on the counter saying for credit card fraud prevention purposes 20% is the default value when no speicifc tip and total value is written on the receipt. It's a McDonald's or Starbucks type fast food restaurant, where there's barely any service after food and drinks being handed over. Maybe because of the restaurant's superior location, they made this rule to target ""stupid"" foreign tourists who don't pay attention to their credit card bills and won't go back anyway."
Equator Coffees,They need to add more seats.
Equator Coffees,Closed because of poor interpersonal management
Equator Coffees,Their cookies are great!
Equator Coffees,They messed up all the drinks
Equator Coffees,"Hello, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.  I understand how frustrating it would be to place an order and get something different.  We want everyone who visits our cafe to have a wonderful experience and in the situation we fell short.  We have been working really hard to maintain staffing levels, so that we can ensure that our guests have a wonderful experience.  It has proved to be really challenging and it has contributed to some of the issues you experienced during your visit to our cafe.   We would like the opportunity to make it up to you.  Please reach out to me directly and we can figure out how to do that. Again, I'm really sorry. Sincerely, Tina Malouf tmalouf@equatorcoffees.com"

Equator Coffees,"Best lunch view ever overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge! We got coffee with something delicious and after a walk across the bridge and back we had lunch - with something delicious again ;)  The coffee was fine, but especially the selection of pastries was great. Very tasty.  The lunch was better than expected. I had a quinoa salad with pumpkin, pomegranate seeds, lettuce and a poached egg. Was really very tasty. For dessert - why not after lunch - I had a peanut butter cookie and my boyfriend a cinnamon roll but with cardamom. Omg delicious!"
Equator Coffees,"The attention of the place is very good, the guys are very attentive and most of them were bilingual, the prices of the place are reasonable and the quality of their products is very good. The place has a wide variety of products and they even sell the local coffee. What stands out the most is the view towards one of the best bridges in the city."
Equator Coffees,"I loved the Veggie sandwich in this place, I loved its flavor, it had many flavors that combined perfectly but the best thing about this place is having breakfast with a view of the golden gate!"
Equator Coffees,Excellent coffee ‼️  Excellent cherry lemonade. Superb view of the bridge.  I recommend! 🏄🏼‍♂️
Equator Coffees,"Fast food with a magnificent view of the Golden Gate, it's worth it just for that ☺️"
Equator Coffees,"Had a quick bite to eat and drink here. Nothing fancy, but a welcome break after hiking the Golden Gate Bridge."
Equator Coffees,"The location is very nice with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, but the ""dishes"" and snacks are very expensive for cafeteria quality (sandwich at $15) and packets of chips are not bulky and also very expensive. The sandwiches are still good."
Equator Coffees,The panini are incredibly delicious! With a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge
Equator Coffees,Were surprised at the quality and freshness of the food! Nice bar right on the Golden Gate Bridge. Prices were ok for this location.
Equator Coffees,"The sandwiches were normal, indeed I would say almost heavy. Obviously very high price, I say obviously because the bar is at the entrance of the Golden Gate Bridge"
Equator Coffees,Nothing special but the view is spectacular
Equator Coffees,"Great view of the bridge, delicious food that was ready quickly."
Equator Coffees,Charming place and great coffee. Art deco architecture as well as the bridge. Beautiful view.
Equator Coffees,Croissant paid for and not received. cheek!
Equator Coffees,"I quite liked the view it offers, in fact it is very good. I'm not one to drink espresso but I still thought it was good, on another occasion I tried lemonade and I didn't think it tasted so good. The breads look good, but I haven't had a chance to try them, I'll have another chance."
Equator Coffees,"Small cafe in a pretty building with excellent views of the bridge. Self-service and the narrow range is nothing special, but still okay."
Equator Coffees,"The service staff Tina is very kind, and the view of the Golden Gate Bridge is great while eating. The chicken sandwich is delicious, but the tuna sandwich is a bit fishy."
Equator Coffees,Excellent comfortable view very good place to rest after a walk
Equator Coffees,"A historic cafe with incredible views. Beyond the views, there is nothing so good about it. The coffee is bad, or just as bad as other places in the city, and there are very few seats. The seats are high chairs, and there is only one counter around the cafe so there are no places for people in wheelchairs to sit and have a drink comfortably."
Equator Coffees,"Caution, SCAM at tips!!! they allow themselves to add more tips that you gave! Tenga cuidado, tip scam...... allow me to add more tips than the ones you give. Beware, Tip Scam......allow yourself to add more tips than you give. Warning, tip scam...... feel free to add more tips than you give."
Equator Coffees,delicious coffee and hot dog for the small appetite....the location itself could do with a renovation......
Equator Coffees,"Contrary to what the other comments say, I did not get bad service, I rested for a while after a long walk and regained strength with a ""hot dog"", BUT WHAT KIND OF HOT DOG IS THE CHILLI DOG?! DON'T ASK FOR IT, you can't eat like a normal one, I don't know about the others."
Equator Coffees,The bisque is delicious and the brownies are great!
Equator Coffees,"Actually quite nice. But the food (hot dog) to sell at all is a cheek. In my opinion, the food here is inedible. You might think that they would sell a Schweinfurt resident at a massively inflated price."
Equator Coffees,For the view!
Equator Coffees,Great Italian espresso/cappuccino! + view 😎👍
