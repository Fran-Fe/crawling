Cafe Réveille,"This spot is an ideal working cafe. The space itself is great: high ceiling and lots of light. Seating is comfy enough and there’s plenty outdoor too. I come solo or meet up to do work / grab a bite. Typically go for the falafel bowl with an egg. Beverage-wise my goto’s are drip coffee, almond milk lattés or loose leaf tea. Service is consistently good too."
Cafe Réveille,a little expensive but worth it! avo toast on super good sourdough was amazing. smoothie bowl tasted like straight up sherbet (but vegan!) and yummy iced coffee ☕️
Cafe Réveille,"Amazing food!! I'm honestly more of a old fashioned diner gal, but this place was delicious! And healthy!  However if you're looking for a place you can really sink into the booth and relax, might not be your place... seats and stools are a little stiff.  Great for a coffee date though!"
Cafe Réveille,"Great food options, healthy alternatives to the readily available stock standard take outs. Loved the fresh ingredients and the combination of flavours. Other diners were engrossed with their digital world, so no loud conversations and activity.   Blissful dining experience."
Cafe Réveille,"the most apathetic uninterested waitstaff you can find at a coffee shop. Whether giving my order, asking for silverware or if my name was just called -- everything seemed like an inconvenience to this waitstaff. I'm looking at you blondie hair twirler. Skip this venue and head to the FUELING STATION where you will be graced with good manners and good food."
Cafe Réveille,"Very great first experience here! I got the plantain bowl and it was delicious. The plantain was really ripe and the sauces complimented everything really well. The mocha wasn't the best, but outside of that I enjoyed my experience here. Staff were amazing and super friendly!"
Cafe Réveille,"I went here with my girlfriend and it looks like a really cute little fancy place. Don’t Fall for all the fancy little decor. The drinks are not worth it, especially for the prices that you pay for them; I tried to order an oat milk, mocha, and what I got back was really disgusting… tasted like old, coffee, mixed with expired milk… Or some thing like that. Do not recommend this place, The wait was also very long. My boyfriend also Got a drink that was supposed to be sweet and was absolutely disgusting and was not sweet at all. Do not recommend this place at all"
Cafe Réveille,"Absolutely loved the oat milk latte. The milk and coffee are in the right proportion, ensuring milk is not overpowering the taste while making the coffee creamy. I’m visiting for 7 days and starting my day everyday with a latter here. :)"
Cafe Réveille,"I enjoyed Matcha Green Tea, Açaí Bowl here. Enjoyable space for short work station or quick bites."
Cafe Réveille,"I loved both food and service. The cheese salad was very tasty! Coffee was not my favorite, though."
Cafe Réveille,"I've gone to Cafe Reveille for breakfast so far, and it's been delicious.  I got the breakfast sandwich the first time I came here. I got it to go, but it was surprisingly not soggy when I got home. It's the standard egg and cheese, but still yummy.  The next time I dined here was with a friend. I love chilaquiles so I knew I had to get that. It was so delicious!  It came with a good portion of avocado with two eggs over easy. I still like my go-to place, but the chilaquiles here at Cafe Reveille will be my second go-to since the first one is only open on Saturdays.  There's plenty of seating, but when it's cold, indoor seating may be harder to get. Plus, the acoustics aren't that great so it can get really noisy. Though, I have seen people study/work here. The lines can get long so I recommend getting here early if you can."
Cafe Réveille,Got the levantine sandwich with falafel. It has a good amount of spice to it. The bread was soft but also crunch. Overall it was ok.  The fries were an afterthought. Dry and brittle.  Finally I tried the almond smoothie. For $10 I would say it wasn't worth the price.  This place didn't meet my expectations.
Cafe Réveille,"Wouldn’t post if it was just once but one of the girls with long hair (dark at the top but blends into an orange color) who takes orders has been blatantly rude multiple times. Most recently, I asked for a substitution because I had a mouth surgery. Begrudgingly she asked the kitchen and was visibly talking with a co-worker about how ridiculous of a request it was (substituting crunchy rice for regular rice). It’s always awkward to have a mean girl interaction :( love the food here and hope the staff becomes a little more friendly."
Cafe Réveille,"Cute cafe with healthy breakfast/brunch options including matcha lattes and smoothies. My friend said it was one of her favorite spots in the city, so three of us came here on a Saturday to parktake. Outdoor dining is available as well as takeout. You order at the counter, pay, and then they call your name at the window.  I opted for a breakfast burrito and added on bacon (they also have merguez). I was full after eating three-quarters of it, and ate the next quarter the following day for breakfast (it held up well). The fries they have are similar to McDonald’s fries but softer. The breakfast plate is a hangover remedy and similar to the burrito, is very filling. My friend said that the matcha latte was one of her favorites in the entire city."
Cafe Réveille,"Pricey but good option for healthy breakfast in the neighborhood. The curcuma shot & ginger shot were good. We visited once, we liked, then came back again after couple of days to try a different option."
Cafe Réveille,"Perfect morning, post-workout spot. Fresh smoothies, whole ingredients. Easy takeout and great service. The AL-BERRY smoothie is perfect."
Cafe Réveille,I paid $40 + 7 tip for two Salads and found a hair on the bottom of my salad bowl. Before that I asked for a slice of bread and the waiter told me to pay for it first.
Cafe Réveille,"i have now been to this cafe multiple times, and every time i have gone the staff has been exceptionally rude. they have continuous attitudes as you order, and it is apparent that they pick and choose who to be kind to. as you sit they very clearly give you dirty looks and have no issues loudly talking about you. the staff pays more attention to talking with their coworkers than the costumers, and i have never felt so judged and unwelcomed in an establishment as i did here. the food was subpar and the breakfast burrito i had gotten was lukewarm at best, and the potatoes inside weren’t cooked all the way through. the pastries were the only good part of my times at this cafe and they were very good, but not good enough to make up for the rest of my underwhelming experience. otherwise the rest of my visits were not good and i would not recommend this place to anyone."
Cafe Réveille,The food and coffe are great but the wait is horrendous. 45 min to prepare a coffee is crazy.  and you are expected to wait at the counter for the coffe for an hour while you food is served at the table. These are often served 30 min appart with not clue on which will arrive first
Cafe Réveille,"lovely cup of coffee every time! super kind staff. follows Covid protocols well. clean and modern interior. great pastries too, but the breakfast bowl is really the star of their menu. 😋 …"
Cafe Réveille,"I thought the avo toast in the display case was just for show, but… nope. The bread was cold and dry and the avo was turning brown. Definitely not worth $7"
Cafe Réveille,"Breakfast here was super tasty, lots of choices, the yellow juice was super fresh and delicious. The staff were also super friendly, really good vibe."
Cafe Réveille,"Coffee is okay but overpriced. $7.20 for a medium latte? Wow. The woman at the cashier didn’t even bother to say good morning.. all the other staff is nice tho. Otherwise, cool location and nice ambiance."
Cafe Réveille,"Have only been here a handful of times.  No real complaints about the food (except its often barely warm).  You can never tell when they’re serving what, regardless of what times it says on the menu.  Coffee is decent but overpriced, you can get similar or better coffee at pretty much any other local coffee spot in the area.  The people working the registers are consistently rude."
Cafe Réveille,"The experience from the shop is the same as from the cup of coffee in the photo. It is not bad, and it is not perfect either."
Cafe Réveille,"Ordered a matcha latte and a mocha. I know matcha lattes can be difficult, but the mocha was also awful. Couldn't finish them, the tables were not super comfortable if you want to work either, so I won't be coming back."
Cafe Réveille,"This place it’s very clean and neat, friendly staff and they deliver and you also may place an order online pay and pick up on the way, really works out for me, parking a little inconvenient, everything else super good 😊"
Cafe Réveille,Ok I’m done So  Coffee was good enough for me And the barista is sooooo cute. Haha I love it
Cafe Réveille,"Poor management  The coffee is good and breakfast is mediocre. However, they messed up my order and mixed the number, gave us number 23 but record as 28. It took about 45 minutes to get a breakfast bowl after few follow ups finally was able to get the order. Even though they have served the same food to others before me."
Cafe Réveille,"Delicious food with awesome staff! Recommend the greener smoothie, the breakfast burrito and the almond croissant when its available. Have a delicious lunch menu as well with awesome falafel and french fries."
Cafe Réveille,"Great coffee, nice place to hangout with friends. The line tends to be usually long"
Cafe Réveille,Spacious area to work (at least outside). The coffee is good but nothing extremely memorable.
Cafe Réveille,"Delicious and flavorful healthy and superfood bowls/smoothies/latte’s etc. Pricey, but worth it on occasion. I especially enjoy the plantain bowl and chia parfait. Creative and colorful dish combinations. Kombucha and adaptogenic drink options as well. Clean modern aesthetic and friendly staff. It is a delightful enough experience to tip me in favor of splurging and leaves you feeling great after (not groggy like after junk food but actually great)  :)"
Cafe Réveille,"One of the best coffee spots in Polk st. Good food and coffee. Ambience is great too; you'll find people either just chatting and hanging out, or doing stuff with their laptops. I like coming here in the afternoon for a last stint of work with my laptop."
Cafe Réveille,Lovely space.  Good coffee. Outdoor seating.
Cafe Réveille,"Trendy cafe with good coffee, pastries, breakfast and lunch options. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I come here often for coffee and small bites. Most of the time the staff are nice and food is good. Last time I came I ordered a flat white coffee and an avocado toast to have there. They give me a latte and a big toast with little avocado on top and all were for take out and they were kind of unapologetic/rude when I told them they mistaken my order."
Cafe Réveille,Seriously??? I ordered a Grilled Chicken Breast side and……… I don’t expect lot of grilled chicken but this is insane and so disrespectful
Cafe Réveille,"Good ambiance, delicious coffee, and reliably good food. I come here often for the pitaya bowl and a latte- one of my favorite breakfasts in the city."
Cafe Réveille,"Why is it that every time I order a smoothie, it takes 15+ minutes? When there's barely one in there and no one else is waiting to order? There's always more than 1 person working there but they seem to want to talk to each other than pay attention to the customers. No apology, no acknowledgement. And I'll bet the owners don't even care because they're probably doing well gouging people on overpriced coffee and food."
Cafe Réveille,Food is slow coming out. Coffee is great. Long line to get in on weekends. It would be great to have a separate line for people wanting drinks to go. That would be awesome.
Cafe Réveille,"Only come here if you enjoy expensive poor customer service. I spent $5.25 for an iced latte + $1 for tip + a 3% employee healthcare tax (that they add on although you only see it after you pay). My $6.41 iced latte arrived and the milk was not near the top of the rim. I asked the barista if she could pour milk to the top and she gave me the dirtiest look imaginable and without saying anything grabbed the oat milk and was about to pour it in even though it was whole milk. I don't think asking for a full drink is too much, especially when spending that much money. It would have taken her two seconds to ask what kind ok milk I had. I wish I could have my $1 dollar tip back. The coffee itself was fine but nothing notable and not worth the money or the attitude."
Cafe Réveille,"Nice place, unfriendly staff, though I can understand that they were tired at the end of their work day and we were there on new year's eve. Still there's a basic humility that one would expect."
Cafe Réveille,Beautiful interior but overpriced coffee/tea
Cafe Réveille,"Has a nice spacious inside. Expect to wait outside because of Covid. It is very loud inside, so if you want to study and noise bothers you, bring noise canceling headphones.  The espresso is good.  The outdoor seating has heaters."
Cafe Réveille,"Amazing  The best lattes in SF.  All their locations are the same in terms of quality.  The other coffee shops of similar quality are Ritual and Blue Bottle.  Edit: in recent months, the lattes have been a bit ‘less’ good then their previous glory. Not sure why but still a great place for a latte"
Cafe Réveille,Great food and drinks. Highest quality for good prices.
Cafe Réveille,"Great coffee, with a friendly and calm vibe to be appreciated in contrast to the hectic and bustling city right outside."
Cafe Réveille,Healthy and yummy! Love their bowls and matcha!
Cafe Réveille,Coffee is good. They also have a lot of space to sit down. Only downside is that they can be super slow sometime so go there only when you are not in a rush.
Cafe Réveille,I like Cafe Reveille . There Food is Good . Coffee good . Price for over 6.00 for a Latte is pretty darn steep. The Staff is very Friendly and I do go regularly.  I stick to regular Coffee 90% of the time.
Cafe Réveille,Love it here. I frequent about 2-3 times a week to grab a quick latte with my pup. All the ladies (and men) who work here are super friendly. Coffee is always prepared super promptly with trays and bag by the door for your way out.  The line can be a little long in the morning but you can catch them at the right time and it can be a breeze. The interior decor is super cute. Lord of greenery and it’s pink!
Cafe Réveille,"Wasn't a very cozy or comfortable spot, but probably the best hot chocolate I've ever had! Bravo"
Cafe Réveille,"We were also disappointed to find they won’t serve in reusable cups, and don’t care about the environment. We ended up going to Starbucks down the road who will happily accept a byo reusable cup and fill it for you. Dissapointing as this place looked like it could have been good."
Cafe Réveille,Placed an order ahead of time and let the host know. We got asked to wait outside. Coffees were ready pretty quickly and someone called out our name to get them once they were ready. Coffee was good (hence not a 1-star review). We kept waiting for our food but no one called our name. Eventually when I went to check on our order it had been sitting at their counter the whole time. It was barely warm and the people who didn’t even bother calling us to pick it up despite us sitting at their shop seemed extremely unapologetic about it. They even tried to blame me saying that I probably hadn’t checked in with the host (I obviously had since we had already got our coffees). I get that it’s a new restaurant but not a great way to pretend it’s my fault for your bad service.
Cafe Réveille,Espresso! One of the rare places in San Francisco to get a minimally reasonable espresso if you enjoy having a real espresso.
Cafe Réveille,"Nice ambiance for grabbing tea/coffee with friends and just to work. The WiFi is decent, and the staff is friendly and accommodating."
Cafe Réveille,"I’m surprised the average rating is so low, as we live across the street from the Polk St location and are repeatedly impressed with the food. The breakfast sandwich and burrito, the burger, grilled chicken sandwich—and today I just tried the mushroom pasta—all delicious and well priced. I just wish they stayed open later."
Cafe Réveille,"Tasty, healthy food, love the place! :)"
Cafe Réveille,"A bit too expensive, not the best coffee in town. All is beautiful but not convinient (seatings). Workers not friendly at all"
Cafe Réveille,"Awesome coffee and drinks, but even better? Their staff!!! Literally some of the most energetic and kind people ever. Definitely recommend!"
Cafe Réveille,First time it took 20 mins for a smoothie and the second time took 30 mins for an acai bowl I'm never everrr coming back
Cafe Réveille,They only serve in single use plastic and refuse to serve in reusable byo cups. No regard for the planet. Don’t recommend. We went to Starbucks down the road and the even fill in reusables. Disappointing.
Cafe Réveille,"This place is great - solid food and a really good capp!  A few of these around town, and we are stoked to have them in our neighborhood now as well.  Suggestion : Get a coffee from here and an acai bowl from Basik next door  = )"
Cafe Réveille,Coffee is good but I’ll never come back unless I have tons of time to kill.
Cafe Réveille,I only had coffee but the place looks nice and clean practices safety guidelines during this time. Hope to try their food soon .
Cafe Réveille,This place is run by an excellent team. Consistently great coffee and always a pleasure to visit.
Cafe Réveille,"I have come here multiple times 15 minutes before closing and the staff will not serve me. This is a to-go establishment, so if someone arrives before closing they should be served. Change your hours or follow your hours."
Cafe Réveille,The coffee was delicious and the food tasteful but it was very cold inside
Cafe Réveille,Great cafe for remote work.
Cafe Réveille,"Love the coffee, food and the vibe. Friendly staff and great service.. that breakfast sandwich + the works = money"
Cafe Réveille,Their egg sandwich is the only egg sandwich in the neighborhood that I like. Drinks are great too
