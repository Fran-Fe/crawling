Compton’s Coffee House,Found this coffee ☕️  shop after watching suntise. It is a nice local little coffee shop. Looks like many are regular and live in neighborhood. Service was quick. The latte is not that strong. Pastries are yummy. It is pet friendly coffee shop.
Compton’s Coffee House,"Hi Dharma,  Thank you so much for the kind words about our store and service. For the lattes, we do add 2 shots to every drink, but our espresso does trend a bit on the lighter side and can blend in with the milk a little more.   Thank you again for visiting,  Compton’s"
Compton’s Coffee House,Medium roast single origin. Coffee was slightly bitter = medium Barrister. Overall if you look for an exciting coffee experience then this is probably not your place. But ok to stop by.
Compton’s Coffee House,"Thanks for the feedback Lutz, we appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day."
Compton’s Coffee House,"Honestly pretty average coffee with a cashier that really didn’t want to be there. I asked if the matcha latte had any expresso and they said it did not, which is contrary to what I thought so I paid an extra $1.00 for one shot. Got the latte and it didn’t hit any expectations well. It wasn’t that hot, it had just a bit of matcha taste (for what the dark green color looked like, it should have had more matcha flavor) and it didn’t even taste like there was coffee in it.  Also it’s alright for a single person to work from but the tables aren’t really for having more than one person at each"
Compton’s Coffee House,Thanks for the feedback Wilson. We will continue to work on improving so we can be better going forward.   -Compton’s
Compton’s Coffee House,Great coffee. And very reasonable prices too. Service with a large smile and quick too. Clean restroom as well for the weary tourists. Didn't try any food items though.
Compton’s Coffee House,"Excellent Service. Delicious Coffee. Great Environment. Worth It. ♡♡♡  Yummy Treats, Try The Banana Bread. ♡ The 'Indulgent Brownie' is A Bit Over Priced for The Size. I would call it a 2.50. Cheers."
Compton’s Coffee House,"Jana,   Thank you so much for the amazing review, we’re so happy that you like our coffee and treats.  Please come back anytime :)  -Compton’s"
Compton’s Coffee House,Had a cold brew and lavender latte. Both were good! Lavender latte was a bit sweet for me. I’ll probably have it less sweet next time.
Compton’s Coffee House,The bacon cheddar scone was kinda trash but the hot americano was one of the best I’ve had in a while! I came for the coffee so the pastry was whatever.
Compton’s Coffee House,What a lovely place for coffee and pastries in the neighborhood. My standard black coffee and either the vegetarian or bacon scone are highly recommended. My only issues is that it had become a hangout for the remote workers so getting a seat to enjoy quiet moment with your coffee and treat can be challenging. Parklets have been replaced with a couple tables and chairs.
Compton’s Coffee House,"Chill spot with friendly staff, decent coffee and small pastries. They have outdoor parklets if the weather permits. The inside seating ain’t made for parties but has comfy seat pads.  Wifi if you are looking to hang for a little bit. Water bottles available for purchase with a few other random drinks."
Compton’s Coffee House,Great cortado. Absolutely love the vibe and it was a great place to get some work done. Friendly staff as well
Compton’s Coffee House,"Incredible experience. Owner operated which makes a huge difference. Fillmore St has more than its fair share of chains making it especially nice to have this independent shop. Good coffee, good seating (indoor and outdoor) and friendly staff."
Compton’s Coffee House,"A very trendy and modern little coffee shop surrounding by tons of things to do in San Francisco! We drove here from our hotel and found parking quite quickly for the morning. It was only a few minutes to japantown from there, so we fed the meters on very little quarters happily and had breakfast !!  Super quick service, a good selection of both classic and unique drinks, with delicious bakery items that taste fresh and flaky!!  One downside is they do not put lids on the cups, they supply them, but with how full the cups are, a mess is inevitable."
Compton’s Coffee House,"A really cozy cafe that allows customers to stay both indoor and outdoor seating. The oat milk latte I ordered was good and I like the rich flavor of the espresso which would not be covered by the flavor of oat milk. Last but not least, it's perfect if you want to work here. They offer free and high-speed wifi here."
Compton’s Coffee House,Thank you for the amazing review Andrew. It was a pleasure having you and we look forward to your next visit. -Aidan Compton
Compton’s Coffee House,"I loved this place and would’ve given it 5 stars before I learned it was opened by my favorite barista, Aidan, from Peet’s on Chestnut. I wish there was a 6 star option. The staff are friendly, the coffee is good, and I love the space! I learned today that they make their own vanilla and lavender syrup— here’s a pic of them being “caught in the act” of vanilla syrup making… check out those vanilla beans!"
Compton’s Coffee House,"crisp, clean and friendly aesthetic. the two staff members were super sweet and helpful. it’s a cute place to grab coffee with a friend or even get some work done. i got a peppermint ice tea and was not disappointed, i would highly recommend.  the barista mentioned others who come by here to get work done. although it’s a small space, there’s quite a bit of indoor and outdoor seating. the seating toward the back on the long table has outlets."
Compton’s Coffee House,Super friendly staff who made my vegan matcha latte with much love
Compton’s Coffee House,"Locally owned coffeeshop serving Variety coffee from New York. Great taste, friendly staffs, quiet and good ambiance with outdoor seating. Perfect morning spot."
Compton’s Coffee House,"The coffee is great, of course, but the people working here went above and beyond to have good customer service. When I mentioned to my partner that I would share my coffee with them, they offered to split it into two cups. That's never happened before and I really appreciated it."
Compton’s Coffee House,Very good coffee any always so great to have it in a real cup not paper. Super friendly service as well.
Compton’s Coffee House,Very tasty coffee and lovely atmosphere both inside and outside.
Compton’s Coffee House,"I was so happy find a small, local, & family owned coffee shop within a short walk from UCSF Mt. Zion.   I ordered my go to midday pick-me-up: a dirty chai with oat milk. The chai they use is mildly spicy and is perfect with a shot of espresso and oatly oatmilk which gives it a touch of sweetness.  I'll definitely be back for my lunch breaks!"
Compton’s Coffee House,Adorable independent coffee shop in lower pacific heights. Friendly staff & delicious coffee & pastries. Stop by to support new small businesses in the city. It’s take courage to start a business at this time.
Compton’s Coffee House,Cute little coffee shop. Coffee and pastry were great.
Compton’s Coffee House,Thank you so much for your amazing review. We’re so glad you enjoyed your visit!   -Team Compton’s
Compton’s Coffee House,Great coffee and friendly staff! What more could I ask for. I'm definitely coming back for another cup whenever I go to San Francisco again.
Compton’s Coffee House,"Thank you so much for visiting us while you were in SF, come back soon!"
Compton’s Coffee House,New coffee spot on Fillmore St. Service was friendly and the space is huge. They have some baked goods there.  I ordered macchiato and americano. They were okay. Parking may be difficult.
Compton’s Coffee House,Popped into this place as it was near our hotel. Staff were super friendly and the coffee was great! I had a latte with oat milk which was delicious!

Compton’s Coffee House,"Thank you Aliza, we’re so happy to hear about your experience! Come back soon:  Team Compton’s"
Compton’s Coffee House,"This is probably the best coffee shop in Fillmore st. Coffee is really good, staff is nice and helpful. You will find folks with their laptop wired in getting some work done. The ambience is nice, with quality background music. The only downside is that it's a bit small, but if whether allows it outdoor sitting is pretty good too."
Compton’s Coffee House,"Excellent coffee and pastries in a great location on Fillmore. This, plus friendly staff and outdoor seating, made it our breakfast choice for a week in San Francisco."
Compton’s Coffee House,"Coffee is to die for. My daughter ordered the lavender latte, and I had the vanilla. Staff were so friendly!"
Compton’s Coffee House,love the brownie and latte. a nice place to work and fast wifi
Compton’s Coffee House,"Sweet, small.place with good coffee and a few pastries. Bring a vaccination card to sit inside."
Compton’s Coffee House,I enjoyed the drip coffee. Nice ambience but small inside so keep that in mind if you're going for a place to sit.
Compton’s Coffee House,"This is the single most delicious vanilla latte I’ve had in my entire life.  I’ve been drinking coffee for 28 years.  No trace of bitterness covered by too much sweetness.  Lightly sweet, slightly frothy, perfect amount of ice. Like sipping heaven."
Compton’s Coffee House,"The dessert that I ordered tasted like the frosting was made from margarine instead of butter. It feels heavy instead of a light texture when you eat it. But I went there mainly for coffee, so I had three cups. Not obviously coffee addict, kidding aside. No sugar just plain coffee, and I enjoyed them all. I had a great time here!"
Compton’s Coffee House,"My favorite local coffee spot, never had a bad experience! The coffee is excellent and the staff are incredibly friendly. Highly recommend to anyone around Fillmore."
Compton’s Coffee House,We tried each of the seasonal drinks and they were both terrific iced. Definitely a great treat for our day of walking around the neighborhood. And the employee who helped us was dressed as Gene Belcher for Halloween so it was a lovely touch to see someone taking Halloween seriously. :)
Compton’s Coffee House,I always have a good experience here. Extremely nice staff. Delicious pastries and drinks. Clean. Quiet. Good atmosphere. Everything you could want in a coffee shop.
Compton’s Coffee House,Small coffee house Coffee good
Compton’s Coffee House,"Came by as the ratings were great and to check out a a new coffee house. The owner Aidan served us & was so nice! He was kind, respectful and so sweet. Please check it out when you can. This place has great vibes and is really clean! I’ll be back"
Compton’s Coffee House,Good cheap coffee. Some of the nicest and friendliest baristas I've met!
Compton’s Coffee House,It’s nice to meet a great coffee in rainy day
Compton’s Coffee House,"The people at this coffee shop are so kind to us (and our puppy!). My husband really enjoys the baked goods, which come from a great bakery in Oakland. The menu is simple and ingredients/coffee are quality. Highly recommend!"
Compton’s Coffee House,"Update : now they have real cups for the coffee. So much more enjoyable than paper. #ReusableSF  Just had a chance to try the new coffee shop I'm the neighborhood.  In spite of it being afternoon, we had cappuccinos, and of course we had to sample the baked goods (start with classics, a cinnamon twist and a blueberry muffin).  Conclusion: these folks know what they're doing. Haven't had any muffin this good in a long time, the cinnamon twist had great texture and was not too sweet or too cinnamony. Cappuccinos were as good as any I've had, and better than most. Nice addition to the neighborhood."
Compton’s Coffee House,best mocha i’ve ever had!
Compton’s Coffee House,Fantastic coffee! Amazing people! Incredible vibe! I highly recommend this new coffee shop :)
Compton’s Coffee House,Excellent coffee shop with friendly service. Queer friendly safe space. I come here all the time and it always starts my day perfect.
Compton’s Coffee House,"Comptons is one of the only places I trust to make a good almond milk latte. As non-dairy folk, it’s hard to find lattes that don’t taste too bitter/burnt... but Aidan and everyone at the shop do a SUPER job! Delicious drinks and really fine coffee beans. Highly recommend!!"
Compton’s Coffee House,Great location.   Comfortable place to spend time.
Compton’s Coffee House,The best coffee in my neighborhood! I love the coffee beans collection as well! I always get it at home to make cappuccino. Highly recommend.

Compton’s Coffee House,"Not my favourite espresso, but good vibes, good coffee, and clearly local"
Compton’s Coffee House,Their Decaf Mocha is the best ever!  Tied with the DecafMocha I found in a little coffee shop in NYC that was the best ever until I found Compton’s. And the pastries are awesome as well.
Compton’s Coffee House,Very friendly folks and pretty chill coffee place. The cappuccino I ordered was fantastic!
Compton’s Coffee House,Best coffee in the neighbourhood! I wish they had more vegan pastries though.
