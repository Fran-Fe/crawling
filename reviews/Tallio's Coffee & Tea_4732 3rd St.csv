Tallio's Coffee & Tea,Really good coffee and bagels with vegan options! Super friendly staff :) and nice deck outside with seating
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,Tallios is a phenomenal shop with great espresso and an incredible staff. They introduced us to the Bay View community and got us excited about what's to come. I'm excited to see if they can find more local bakeries to source pastries!
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,blueberry smoothie was good! outdoor seating is nice. phone chargers inside while you wait. POC owned!
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,Staff was so accommodating and the drinks were all amazing. I would go out of my way to come back here. I had the chai mocha and my friend had the regular mocha. It was the perfect way to start the day
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,Have an amazing experience here. I had never tried the matcha tea which the owner recommended and I'm so glad he did because it was delicious. They have outdoor seating which is very nice and indoor seating as well. We'll definitely be going back here the prices are more than fair and the service is super friendly glad I found this neat little spot.

Tallio's Coffee & Tea,"Drove out of the way to check this place out only to find they're shut down until ""late August"". One star because owner needs to update your online presence and update hours on Google. If you care about your customers, you should probably let them know know they don't waste time trying to visit. Will happily come back and edit this review once they're back opened."
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,"Hello, we are so sorry that you took time to come visit us and we were closed. We have taken your suggestion and are more present online and on our social media. We are temporarily serving our coffee on our parklet and hope you can come visit us when we fully reopen. We truly appreciate the communities support."
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,"Really great shop and owners! I stopped in on a Saturday morning, when other restaurants and cafes are normally closed in the neighborhood. They have an outdoor seating area. I ordered an iced caramel latte, which was delicious, and I would definitely come again!"

Tallio's Coffee & Tea,We have enjoyed Tallio's Coffee for over a year now and continue to enjoy the quality and taste of Tallio's beans. I highly recommend their coffee from a local small business owner who could use the business.
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,"Great way to wake up on Independence Day for my last day in the bay! The staff was friendly and welcoming, the coffee delicious, and they had free WiFi. The owner is really cool and told me his goal is to open upscale coffee shops in lower income neighborhoods around the bay. Very cool spot to grab a cuppa!"
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,"Beautiful place, delicious coffee.. Greetings from Turkey"
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,"The coffee is very good, the place is warm and beautifully decorated. The service leaves a lot to be desired. Almost if you disturb them, not at all friendly, which is the opposite of what I expected in a small neighborhood cafe. If you are the owner and you read this review and want to know more about my experience please contact me via email. I will gladly answer you back."
