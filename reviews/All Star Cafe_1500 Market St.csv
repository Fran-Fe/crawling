All Star Cafe,Used to live across the street. Everything ive ever had from here is great. Love that they have bacon egg and cheese sandwiches too. I dont know where they source their doughnuts from but their pastries are always fresh
All Star Cafe,"My friend and I were staying at the Ram’s Hotel, directly above this Gem of a cafe and let me just say I wish we had visited sooner than our last day in the city. The people who work there are nice and laid back, especially Richard. He was very patient with my friend and I while we decided which pastries to order and what to eat for breakfast. After eating and enjoying each of our selections, I think it is safe to say anything you order from this place will be worth it. We both got a few donuts, including an apple fritter and maple log with custard filling (my jaw dropped at the first bite of each lol) and then for breakfast we both got a breakfast sandwich with avocado, cheese, ham, and egg, on their crossiants and again, my jaw dropped (don’t worry, I caught it before any food fell out xP ). An awesome little place with fairly reasonable prices for the quality and quantity of food you get! I will definitely make it a point to visit these guys again when I’m in town.  Bottom line, if youre a donut lover and breakfast lover like I am, you need to stop by this place."
All Star Cafe,"I honestly don't know why I'm giving them a 2 star I guess for the donut. I asked for a turkey egg and cheese croissant the first thing it smelled funny and I knew then I should have not eaten it. I took one bite and spit it out. the croissant tasted horrible. I spent 15 dollars this morning on something I couldn't eat, I also got a donut and a large coffee i would like my money back."
All Star Cafe,The best American breakfast in San Francisco. Very good service
All Star Cafe,"I will not spend another dime at this place. They are very rude. They’re very disrespectful. The two guys in the front taking the where are very impatient. Have it and put it in my order in wrong multiple times today when I arrive to my destination, I had the wrong order after not being able to eat it, and even having to pay for something that you would not be able to eat, as I turn to come back to visit with your auntie in the back who is probably the only best cook there he tells his auntie no don’t starve her and she turned me around from Business . This is the worst experience I’ve ever had the other cook cannot cook. The food is terrible and I would not recommend anyone to go here."
All Star Cafe,"When in San Francisco I'm very picky where I stop and eat. Not only is this place safe and clean, the donuts are flawless. Plus it's a 6 block walk from my job one way, so I don't feel guilty eating them."
All Star Cafe,When my partner and I stayed in the Rams hotel above All Star Cafe we had no idea this place would be so delicious. We couldn't have been more satisfied after eating their turkey and avocado sandwich on French bread and a couple of their doughnuts... the bread here is to die for and their customer service is excellent as well. We Weill definitely be returning once we return to San Francisco and recommend everyone to check out this gem :)
All Star Cafe,"Standing dine-in only. Great for coffee, doughnuts and lunch plates (fried foods, burgers and some Asian/island style food).  It’s got regular staff and customers. They’re pretty consistent on quality and will throw in extras some time for regular, tipping customers. I enjoyed getting their burger and fries for lunch. Cheap even with the tip, and fairly quick. Good plate-lunch vibes.  FYI, sometimes their number in Google maps is wrong/just doesn’t work even if they’re open and taking orders."
All Star Cafe,"This place is great. The guys that work there are awesome. So very polite and friendly. ( A pleasure to interact with) Especially after a long night at work. The food is the bomb as well. Fresh  hot and delicious every time Donuts are made daily too, fresh and tasty always. Definetly, a jewel in the neighborhood"
All Star Cafe,Really good mocha and bacon omelette. I’m from Sacramento and just happen to find this coffee shop on a wim and I was so happy. My hotel didn’t have coffee. The service here was excellent.
All Star Cafe,"Looking for a keto breakfast? This place was fast, friendly, and the food was delicious.  Be careful, donuts will tempt you! 👀🍩"

All Star Cafe,Literally one of the reason why San Francisco didn’t complete suck! Due to being pregnant I gagged every time I stepped outside but I absolutely loved this place! They were super nice and helpful even when I didn’t really know what to pick. I highly recommend this place even if you had one bad experience because it’s worth countless times to visit!
All Star Cafe,"Best donuts ever from a donut lover. They are made fresh all day and they're always warm and fresh. Nice breakfast and lunch sandwiches served all day along with a great variety of coffee, teas, and soft drinks. Due to being located on a busy cross section of Market St and Van Ness, there are alot of homeless who also frequent the cafe for handouts and money from customers."
