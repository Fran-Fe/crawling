Starbucks,"Starbucks is so famous everywhere and I just love to sit and sip coffee and take a bite of their regular pastry. I love the mug which comes with your name engraved but the coca nitrogen is not something different- its same like plain cold coffee, water and ice. Nothing awesome about it."
Starbucks,"Very clean and comfortable, the place to go to get coffee food and more"
Starbucks,Kerry is awesome! He made my day!!! 🍵 …
Starbucks,"Poor customer service, very disorganized teenage staff. I like Starbucks, they're generally well run with eager to please staff. This one is unpleasant, the staff seems more focused on gossip than saying ""hello."" A lot of attitude"
Starbucks,Jo makes 5 star drinks! Must go to this Starbucks.
Starbucks,Good coffee! But expensive…
Starbucks,"Hello! We're grateful that you shared this experience with us. If you're interested, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs) to share any additional feedback. Thank you!"

Starbucks,Went here few times already! Love the nice stuff! Coffee always hit the spot for me too - thank you baristas :)
Starbucks,"Oscar a barista at this shop decided a 62 year old writer was not welcome at his shop. I was a fraud, e would bang on the restroom door every time I used it. Used a bogus patron of the week contest to try to provoke me and laughing at me it was so funny. Oscar used friends to start a confrontation. Slanderous lies meant to damage. Sadly this lack of common good behavior is very  normal at all San Francisco coffee shops and Starbucks is no different. Adolescent  behavior or worse. This nation of cowards are about to get what they deserve."
Starbucks,"Has lots of outlets, and a bathroom with a code"
