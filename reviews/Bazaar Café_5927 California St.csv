Bazaar Café,"A true gem in the heart of SF. The homemade biscuit was fluffy and full of flavor and the chagaccino was delicious. The space is great for working or hanging out and listening to music. The patio is to die for; very spacious, and the staff was friendly. Can’t recommend this place enough!"
Bazaar Café,"The back garden . OMG. It is just phenomenally beautiful. It's the embodiment of "" one day I'll have this gorgeous backyard where I'll meditate and have coffee"". The coffee is amazing too. I loved the Chaga and my friend tried the rode latte which was flavorful and had rose petals at the bottom ❤️"
Bazaar Café,"We LOVE the garden, and we LOVE your review (yay for amazing coffee)! Thanks Malabika xox"
Bazaar Café,"Good food (great biscuits!). Super nice people. Original acoustic music and great Thursday night open mic. Parking is scarce better to carpool, use car share or public transportation. It’s right on the California line."
Bazaar Café,Thanks Nina Jo! We heart you xx
Bazaar Café,Staff are very friendly and the lines move very quickly. We didn't wait long before we were seated. Food was above average but good enough for me. But I still want to come again to taste other dishes.
Bazaar Café,"I love everything about this cafe! Their drinks are expertly made and their food options are delectable. I would highly recommend the chagachinos, biscuits, and pastries.  There's also an adorable backyard garden that perfectly blocks the wind, creating a warm and sunny hideaway.  On top of the amazing food and drinks, they also showcase so much of the community! They have a weekly open mic and display/sell rotating work from local artists."
Bazaar Café,Thanks so much for all the love! We love you right back :-)
Bazaar Café,"Really hit or miss. The garden is so lovely and the baked good are delicious. I'd stay away from the other food though, ordered a sandwich once and it took really long and arrived quite burnt. Sitting inside is tricky, the staff is super welcoming and inclusive which is admirable but also means that any kind of behavior is tolerated. I've often been pretty uncomfortable, I never have this experience outside though"
Bazaar Café,"Hi Calla, thanks so much for taking the time to share this thoughtful feedback. We think we know the behavior you are referring to (yesterday in cafe) and yes, it was a line too far for us too. We've taken some steps to address it. It's a fine line we tread, trying to be compassionate in our hospitality while curating a safe and welcoming space for the broader community.  Glad you love the garden and baked goods! It's been a while since we've seen a too-dark toasted sandwich, next time, tell us right away and we'll try to make it right. And before the whole neighborhood gives up on our toasted sandwiches, curry, quiches and pop-up specials (in which case we would cease to be :-)) - we'd love for you to try those too and let us know what you think. We put some superwitchery/geekery into slow-roasting and prepping ingredients in the hopes that every item on our small menu is worthy of the musicians & artists we support. Hope to see you again!"
Bazaar Café,Had the most delightful experience at Bazaar Café. Ordered an iced coffee and quiche. Had no idea there was an outdoor patio until I overheard someone mention it. I quickly asked what was the best way to get there and WOW. Secret Garden. Ate my breakfast under the lemon tree. What could be better than that on a warm San Francisco morning?
Bazaar Café,"This has quickly become my go-to cafe in the neighborhood since moving here. They are always really nice, they treat everyone like a ‘regular’, and the food and drinks are consistently excellent. Highly recommend the biscuits!"
Bazaar Café,This is so heartwarming - thank you!! 
Bazaar Café,I went with my family and it was so cold  outside.. we went to to give our order ND lady in the front didn't even take our order bec she said until guys who playing guitar they can't turn on the machine.. like r u kidding me it's cold ND we came frm so far to get warm coffee.. they want us to wait 20 to 30 min until they don't stop playing music..
Bazaar Café,"Hi Roop, you stumbled upon a small, all-originals acoustic music venue and we don't grind/steam during sets. As I explained, we happily serve drip coffee/tea (17 varieties) and other drinks all the whole night... just not the big loud steamers, out of respect for our musicians who traveled far to play to an appreciative listening room.  The musicians take breaks between sets and then we steam our hearts out.  We'd love to have you back sometime, those steamed drinks are good!  Take care, Bazaar Crew"
Bazaar Café,Love this spot! Grab a delicious drink and go sit in the back garden. So cozy and beautiful!
Bazaar Café,Thanks for the love!! 
Bazaar Café,"I tried their Rose Caramel drink, it wasn't overly sweet like you would expect from a Caramel drink, but just right. The rose petals provided a nice aroma when I sipped the drink.  It's a nice local Cafe, that's been serving the Richmond District for over 25+ years, I love the local feeling and the sense of community, I recently moved back to the Richmond district, it made me so happy that Bazaar Cafe is still here.  I hope the Dalgon is back, that's my favorite drink. Oscar is very cool, he takes his time offering some friendly banter, gets to know the customers and just makes you feel welcome."
Bazaar Café,Dalgona is back for the summer :-) Thanks for the lovely review! 
Bazaar Café,"Quite the quirky little cafe. I loved the vibe and the folks working there were helpful, kind and genuine. The  veggie curry was good though SUPER overpriced considering more than half the serving was just white rice."
Bazaar Café,Adorable backyard with a big lemon tree. Their latte has nutty and creamy tastes - so good!
Bazaar Café,Thanks so much for sharing the goodness! 
Bazaar Café,Cute cafe and friendly staff. Their matcha was delicious and they have oat milk! The Japanese soup with salmon is so filling and nice on a cold day.
Bazaar Café,Super cute cafe with lots of great selection and friendly staff. It’s smaller so not as many seats inside but the secret garden is also a great option on a warmer day.
Bazaar Café,"The staff was so friendly and accommodating for gluten free.   The was was delicious and the coffee was some of the best I ever had.   They have cool shows and events, it's a quaint place to hang out."
Bazaar Café,YES! All that coffee geekery is paying off :-) Thanks for the lovely review!
Bazaar Café,"We went to Bazaar Cafe with coffee passports and were pleasantly surprised by the delicious coffee and pastries! We loved the lavender shortbread. Service was kind and superb. Thoughtful COVID modifications. Definitely check them out, if you’re in the area!"
Bazaar Café,"Thanks for the kind words, Lexi!"
Bazaar Café,They served the coffee very fast. Loved the way they presented the coffee.
Bazaar Café,"Local café with seating and internet, ideal spot when you need to get some work done. Staff is friendly and they have a traditional selection of coffees. Drinks were good and prices were reasonable. I'll come back!"
Bazaar Café,"Can’t say enough good things about this place. I would line up around the block for their breakfast buttermilk biscuit, and yet I never have to. The backyard is an absolute gem. Prices are very reasonable. Staff are legit. And the owners go above and beyond to support the local artist and music community. Amazing spot."
Bazaar Café,Perfect food crafted with detail and wonderful coffee! I'm always excited to eat here especially in the garden out back. You know when you're on vacation somewhere exotic and everything seems to taste better? This place has that experience because the food is so outrageously good. The eats and drinks are so good here it will make you feel like you're on vacation.
Bazaar Café,"A warm and wonderful cafe with fantastic coffee, delicious food, and the best atmosphere—it was the perfect stop on our trip. We will definitely be back! 🙂 …"
Bazaar Café,"I happen to stop in on my way to the beach and holy moly I was blown away! I got the biscuit with cheddar and turkey bacon, literally amazing! The biscuit was so savory and the cheese was melted and perfect. And an iced coffee with coffee cubes. They have a cute patio out back that’s great for hanging out with your foods too!"
Bazaar Café,Thanks so much for sharing!!
Bazaar Café,"My daughter grew up there, used to study for school and college. I used to go there to work, for dates and for meetings. All and all, this is the place to call home :). Food is ok, pastries are great, coffee is good and cheap, music is sometimes lovely and sometimes annoying. And the backyard is precious.  If you want to have an intimate experience of how folks live in Richmond - come over and have a look."
Bazaar Café,"This is my favorite cafe in SF. The atmosphere is relaxed and I like the different seating areas! The food&beverages are alright, but I enjoy the feel of this cafe so it's not so much a big deal as they at least have many options! They also have live music which is always nice!"
Bazaar Café,"A neighborhood favorite for a reason. Good coffee, amazing biscuits, and the loveliest staff you could hope for. Try a rosy dawn (earl grey tea latte with rose & honey) if you feel like a comforting sweet treat!"
Bazaar Café,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city! It's so ""San Francisco""! Very cozy and warm. The backyard is so pretty! Ones I've asked for a lemon to add to my tea and lady pick it for me from a lemon tree that's growing there! Also they have amazing music and poetry shows every weekend! Love it!"
Bazaar Café,"I started coming here when I walked by one weekend morning with my dog and saw a sign inviting pups into the garden seating area out back. They have a couple of bags of treats open inside usually too, but I like to get a bully stick from Cals Pet Store across the way and have a proper date. She will chew happily for an hour, and I sip whatever large coffee drink I'm into that day. Note Cals opens later on the weekends, so plan for brunch if you do the same with your dog."
Bazaar Café,"The biscuits were to die for! Great food , keep up the good work !"
Bazaar Café,Thank you so much! We're rather fond of them too :-)
Bazaar Café,"The wifi is great and the garden is nice. Best of all, the staff has never once made fun of me or beaten me up, even though I probably deserve it and would get absolutely destroyed by them."
Bazaar Café,"Great local coffee shop and cafe with an eclectic decor and lovely garden patio. It's not uncommon to see patrons chatting with the owners and baristas like friendly neighbors, in addition to having a constantly evolving events calendar that includes live music, poetry and art events. Overall, a super cool cafe to enjoy an afternoon at or catch up with someone over a latter. I recommend the rhubarb pie!"
Bazaar Café,"Nice coffee place close to Baker’s beach. Tried latte and Matcha latte. It was good enough. This cafe has that local coffee and ambiance feeling. They have live music 🎶 staring at 7 pm I think in weekend. Lot of cafe closes at 6 pm. If you need coffee sometime after that, this is good place. …"
Bazaar Café,"This spot is owned by lovely people who are huge supporters of local artists and musicians. I've performed here a few times, and they're so wonderful to work with. The space is versatile -- by day, it's a quite place to work and grab a coffee by yourself or sit on the back patio with a friend. By night, it's a casual live music venue. One of my favorite little-known spots in San Francisco."
Bazaar Café,"One of the best venues in town for singer-songwriters, with a focus on original music.  Les is a sweet guy and is a great supporter of local musicians.  There's a great open mic on Thursdays that's well worth attending.  And the food is good, too!"
Bazaar Café,"Feels like home, food is absolutely wonderful and pairs beautifully with the coffee. The owner and staff are very friendly. I highly recommend stopping by for a biscuit a latte, and a chat!"
Bazaar Café,"Thanks so much, Paige!"
Bazaar Café,"The place is great for live music and the ambiance is also awesome. They have good collections of tea and coffee. The staff's are friendly and polite in nature. Being a coffee lover, I totally  loved this place."
Bazaar Café,"This neighborhood spot was in danger of closing a few years ago, but the regulars helped keep it alive. It has several seating areas, each with a different feel, the cozy den, the communal work table, and a backyard outdoor garden. Great coffee, pie, and other libations (including beer!), good snack food - where else can order popcorn that's not a sports or movie venue? They also feature music and other performances in the evenings, and they enforce a no laptop zone in the front of the house at those times. Staff is always great and prices are in line with other coffee places in the area. Parking can be tough as you have to compete with the residential neighbors."
Bazaar Café,"Quaint, small cafe on a quiet street of San Francisco. The barista and owners were friendly and a pleasure to talk to. Lots of art and local knick knacks for sale. Coffee was great! They also have open mic weekly on Thursdays and it’s a cozy venue to meet others. I believe the owner also does some art lessons/sessions as well. Highly recommend this little jewel :)"
Bazaar Café,"Quirky little cafe with a couple gluten-free treats, live music, and an intimate vibe. Went for a little concert and walked away with an entirely new community. Love their passion for highlighting our local artist community."
Bazaar Café,Cozy atmosphere with beer and wine and fine food. Backyard patio is restful. Thursday is Open Mic. Acoustics are superb due to all wood interior.
Bazaar Café,"Best cafe in this area or even in SF. Very relaxing atmosphere with spacious rooms, which makes it perfect for working or reading. The cafe also offers wide variety of drinks, snacks, food, and dessert. Sometimes, there are performances as well!"
Bazaar Café,"After a day at Crissy Field, we were looking for a nice spot to take a end-of-the-day coffee break. We found Bazaar Cafe, and were pleasantly surprised. It looked like it was closed (since curtains were closed over), but if you encounter that same issue don't let it deter you! The inside was eclectically decorated, and classic music filled the interior (had I brought something to work on, I'm sure I would have been as focused as ever!). The coffee, too, was very enjoyable. It is simple, but just what I was looking for. The real jewel of this cafe is the garden area in the ""backyard."" It was beautifully landscaped, and super relaxing (there was almost zero city noise!). In summary, if you're in the neighborhood, take a coffee break at Bazaar Cafe."
Bazaar Café,Great coffee and tea selections (I particularly like the London Fog) as well as a great ambiance. Free WiFi too if you buy something. This place is a hidden gem in the area so definitely stop by if you’re around. Highly recommend!
Bazaar Café,Really cool café. Very very close quarters inside. Well made food and drinks at reasonable prices. The real treat is being able to sit in the garden out back! They even bring your food to you out there! A hidden gem of the richmond area. Live music is there every night as well!
Bazaar Café,"Bazaar is hands down my favorite cafe in SF for doing cafe things. Work (good wifi, lots of plugs), read a book, chill out. It has character, art, and music shows most evenings.  The food is also pretty good - try the curry or rice soup if it's available. The coffee is acceptable- if you want really topnotch coffee, look elsewhere.  But if you want a lovely spot for relaxing and reading a book while it rains outside, this is the place."
Bazaar Café,"This is probably the coziest cafe I've been to in this area without being too kitschy. I ordered an oat milk latte and a quiche which came with a side salad. I think the type of quiche changes since the barista, who was really nice and pleasant, wanted to double check that I was okay with it being the Mexicali style that day ~ and I was! There was jalepeno which gave it a nice amount of heat without breaking a sweat"
Bazaar Café,"Local cafe. Friendly staff. Coffee better than it used to be. Fun food options, and more coming soon.  Outdoor garden with free WiFi! They also serve wine and beer!"
Bazaar Café,Their dalgona coffee is an excellent treat! Truly a small neighborhood cafe with so much personality and delicious snacks. My regular spot so far.
Bazaar Café,"Thanks so much for this lovely review, Ren!"
Bazaar Café,Zach sure did not want me to read. Lots of tech thieves in that crowd. They know who they are. Ocelet Industries pursuing legal redress. They will eventually understand.
Bazaar Café,"Fantastic mocha, friendly staff, and good music!"
Bazaar Café,"Honestly blown away - the biscuit was really good, coffee was good, wifi was good, vibe was good, service was good. I mean... They really nailed it."
Bazaar Café,Yeah! That's what we aim for :-). Thanks Nicolai! 
Bazaar Café,"We walked in on a performance night they were having, and both the coffee and the music were amazing. The atmosphere is very cozy and extremely welcoming. Would highly recommend!"
Bazaar Café,Great place to get some work done during the day. They have live music at night and it's fun to hang out with friends and listen. They have a small food menu if you get there with an appetite.
Bazaar Café,"Great cafe . Mellow atmosphere very conducive to getting work done . Fair prices , good music playing , cute and friendly baristas . If you stick around long enough they have live music in the evenings."
Bazaar Café,Excellent people behind the cohnter. Great coffee. Quality food. Love the back patio.
Bazaar Café,Super chill neighborhood spot.  Surprisingly good food.  Great outdoor space in the back.  Need to up their tea selection though.
Bazaar Café,"An expanded tea selection is on its way! We just set up our pretty new tea rack, which allows us to display 18 teas at a time."
Bazaar Café,"Really cute place, the garden in the back is very nice. Oat milk cappuccinos are very good. They have live music frequently as well."
Bazaar Café,Just played a two hour set of original songs. Les (the owner) and the barista listened intently along with the guests. This may be the most enjoyable show I've ever played.
Bazaar Café,"Placed order and paid. They forgot about my order. Waited over 10 mins, I asked again for it, and they made it. But they didn’t care at all, no apologies, nothing."
Bazaar Café,"Oh no! That sounds awful. We're so so sorry. That doesn't sound the way we normally respond to mistakes, doubly sorry. If you're still in the neighborhood, please stop by, we'd like to at least make it right in a small way.  Josh, Oscar & Rory all know & are ready! "
Bazaar Café,Great place for delicious coffee or anything else you could want. Their baked goods are phenomenal and they have live music almost every evening.
Bazaar Café,Loved the coffee and red pepper w/ feta cheese biscuit!
Bazaar Café,💙
Bazaar Café,"Used to be my favorite place to eat at and hangout, cheap but tasty food. Very artistic and pleasant environment. They need to renovate their restroom though"
Bazaar Café,"Nice spot. Amazing patio, great pies. Owner could be a bit friendlier...otherwise, I recommend. Update: new owners friendly and actively involved."
