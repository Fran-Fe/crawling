Telescope Coffee,small takeout only cafe tucked in soma. the honeycomb latte was perfect and not too sweet! would also highly recommend the banana cream pie.
Telescope Coffee,Amazing coffee and hands down the best baked pastries I’ve had in SF. Highly recommend this place!  I also get the rosemary tomato focaccia every time I come and it’s always fresh and delicious. Service was quick and everyone is super friendly too.
Telescope Coffee,"We absolutely love the honeycomb latte and the rose latte!  The honeycomb gradually melts into the coffee making a lightly sweet drink (I loved it even though I usually don’t prefer sweet coffees). The rose latte is definitely sweeter of the two but we appreciated how strong the rose flavor was.  We have also tried the banana bread here which was pretty solid (especially when heated up) but was very expensive for the size so probably wouldn’t get it again. Also there isn’t much seating other than an outdoor bench so expect to take your coffee to-go!  Overall, love the coffee here and will definitely be coming back!!"
Telescope Coffee,"Nice coffee-based drinks, and decent coffee. I tried the lemon thyme latte with oat milk, and it was really good. I also tried their standard macchiato. It was good, though certainly not the best that I’ve tried in the city. It does seem like they are better known for their specialty drinks (the honeycomb latte is their most popular)."
Telescope Coffee,"A quaint gem of a coffee shop!  The co-owner is also the pastry chef - born & raised in SF - she is whipping up delicious sweet and savory treats with wheat free and vegan options!  The strawberry milk is super yummy and cute as it is served in a reusable strawberry cup - pencil holder, plant propagation vessel, water glass - yours to decide!   The chai mixture is made in house and hits the right balance of sweet and spicy.  Very friendly staff and a wonderful new addition to the neighborhood!"
Telescope Coffee,"Wow, the honeycomb latte has actual chunks of honeycomb tossed in that slowly melt as you drink it!  So delicious!!  I also tried the rosemary tomato focaccia and the peach cream puff.  Everything was *incredibly* fresh and delicious, including the seasonal fresh peach on top of the puff!  Service was quick and friendly too.  Great place to grab and go, with easy street parking outside.  I did not try their Vietnamese coffee yet but I’m very curious..."
Telescope Coffee,"Nice young, chipper staff. Small batch baked goods. I ordered a cappuccino. Clearly should have ordered a honeycomb latte. Support small cafés!"
Telescope Coffee,"I dropped by one day while waiting for SOMArts to open up since it's really close by. The reviews are insanely good so I had really high hopes! One thing I hadn't anticipated when we arrived was how small the cafe is, with no seating. I was a little letdown by that because we thought we could have a seat and enjoy the sunny day. The cafe is very cute but it's in a really random location without much around it. We ended up walking over to Trader Joe's close by while we finished our drinks.  My friend and I got two drinks: the honeycomb latte, hot and the London fog, iced. The coolest thing about the hot drinks were that they came in a cup that had a logo on it that appeared when the cup was hot! Temperature sensitive cups are cooler than I thought they would be. My friend said the honeycomb latte was pretty good and not crazy sweet. The London fog was made with a syrup which was a little sad as I hoped they would make it from a tea bag. It was still good though, and I liked that they offered an iced version.  The service was friendly and efficient. I'm not sure I would go back again unless I'm in the area and hunting for something to drink."
Telescope Coffee,"This place is amazing. The tomato focaccia was a moment this morning for where all my pastry dreams came true. If you want craft anything, please just COME. It is a great idea."
Telescope Coffee,The banana cream puff is amazing. The cream was light with just the right amount of sweetness and the banana filling was very fragrant. Like a banana cream pie in puff pastry form.  Will definitely be coming back to try the other pastries and drinks.
Telescope Coffee,Picked up some coffee from telescope because all my friends were ragging about it. I was so excited I picked some up before work and I was not disappointed- we got the rose latte and iced vanilla latte. It was so good. Next time I need to make sure I get a hold of those pastries they looked amazing
Telescope Coffee,"Small cozy artistic coffee shop.  Pastries are good.  The coffee taste is toward to acidic, like Blue Mountain or Kona, but smooth."
Telescope Coffee,Owner is an SF native who makes all the pastries in house.  And coffee is all by comsic dust and curated specifically for Telescope.  Highly highly recommend!!
Telescope Coffee,"I rarely write reviews but I couldn't not after my first visit to this new spot! It's clear how much time and effort Jenny has put into this place,  both in terms of aesthetics of the cafe and the menu! Their pastries are amazing and I couldn't not get their fresh strawberry milk with matcha served in a literal strawberry cup. I can't wait to go back. Highly recommend!"
Telescope Coffee,Tried both iced mocha and hot mocha and by far one of the best I have had so far in SF! Cinnamon roll is also special! Not your usual cinnamon roll
Telescope Coffee,"Some of the best foam I've ever had plus all desserts are made in house. Can't wait til June, when the strawberry milk returns :)))))"
Telescope Coffee,"Pleasant Saturday morning visit. They have a bench out front where we sat for close to an hour. My friends drank coffee, I had tea and all were good."
Telescope Coffee,The pastries and the London Fog tea are so good! Home made pastries! Great addition to the neighborhood!
Telescope Coffee,"Small local shop with very unique, extremely delicious drinks. The two times I’ve been there I tried something I never saw anywhere else (honeycomb latte and strawberry milk), and both times I loved it. Super recommend it."
Telescope Coffee,"Cute + cozy small coffee shop. Tried the lemon + thyme syrup in an iced oat latte, was subtle and not too overpowering. Perfect morning bevvie. Nice baristas too."
Telescope Coffee,"Got less sweet rose latte, it's not my type of drink."
Telescope Coffee,"This place is the best coffee shop in the bay area, we've been to plenty and this is best, so much so that we buy their beans and make coffee at home. I don't even drink coffee but it's growing on me, I buy the beans and coffees for my partner, she's a coffee maniac, every coffee we've tried has been delicious and consistent. Highly recommend this place. Folks working there are very kind and helpful, owner is fantastic."
Telescope Coffee,"Really delicious and thoughtfully flavorful lattes and drinks! Their Vietnamese iced coffee is less sweet than the classic, and they offer non-dairy condensed milk options, which is amazing. I usually make my own coffee at home, but love coming here for a drink to treat myself.  My favorite is the honey comb latte, but can’t go wrong. All their pastries are amazing as well"
Telescope Coffee,"Adorable place, friendly staff, and good drinks. The lemon thyme latte was way too sweet for my taste, but I'd go back to ask them to sweeten more lightly or try something else. Glad there's something else in this neighborhood!"
Telescope Coffee,"Their Vietnamese iced coffee is just perfect for those hot SOMA days. The shop is also run by the loveliest women, one of them is a pastry chef who bakes everything onsite!"
Telescope Coffee,"I use to come here all the time, their baked goods and drinks were good. But for some unexplained reason I started getting the cold shoulder from the owner who also works there regularly… I stopped going from then on. I enjoy supporting small businesses even if they are a lil pricey. But I can’t see myself going back anymore due to some real awkwardness and tension when I come in for a drink or baked goods. Truly unfortunate since they are so close to my house and I love their focaccias"
Telescope Coffee,"I only recently realized this was my local coffee shop, and you know what it’s a damn good local coffee shop. The honeycomb latte is actually a p smart drink that changes sweetness as time goes on (which makes it taste better relative to the last sip). It also uses light-medium roast Vietnamese coffee which is pretty similar to an Ethiopian, but with less tartness which works to create a really balanced drink. You can also get a pretty fun picture of it if you want as many others have.  I also got a cheddar and jalapeño biscuit. It was pretty good, and had that nice airy texture. The service was also great.  The only major downside is there’s no seating, hopefully they can move into a bigger location at some point.  The place is also def overpriced, so I probably won’t go again solo, but if I have a friend visiting who wants coffee, it’s a great stop."
Telescope Coffee,"I’m a supporter of small businesses, and I’ve been at least 4-5 times to this place. Slightly overpriced, but I was trying to support the business. Recently had an extremely poor customer service experience, this involved one of the owners, that will keep me and my friends from returning which is a shame because I was trying to encourage my friends to support this place. Ruined it for all of us and made it awkward for all, including the employees. To the owners, your employees will follow your lead so lead by example."
Telescope Coffee,Honeycomb latte is quite tasty. Note that as of December 2022 they do not have any seating either indoors or outdoors.
Telescope Coffee,This place caught my eye while I was walking through the area and I decided to drop in on a whim about a month ago. Ended up with a cinnamon roll and their signature latte. They have incredible cinnamon rolls! Also I really loved the service and friendliness from the lady behind the counter! Glad I stopped by.
Telescope Coffee,"This is my favorite coffee and bakery place in SF. Me and my husband love their Rosemary foccawsia w cheese and the ube flan, they are bomb!! As for the coffee, I personally like the maple latte and rose latte, both are tasty. This already became my must go to place before going to work, you won’t be disappointed."
Telescope Coffee,Great coffee and pastries! I am a regular here and my favourite is the cold brew here is exceptional. The matcha latte and chai latte is also great  Bonus: they open until 5pm on weekdays which is later than most if not all coffee shops nearby
Telescope Coffee,"Excellent coffee shop. We got the honeycomb Latte and Chai. Both were exceptional. We also tried a salted caramel cupcake, apple tart (GF), and a cinnamon roll. Each pastry was excellent. The cinnamon roll was in the top five that I have tried. The staff was very kind and friendly. I highly recommend stopping by this newer coffee shop. Had the iced Vietnamese coffee on 2/26/22 and the Ginger Molasses cookie... excellent 👌"
Telescope Coffee,"Honeycomb latte was good. When I last visited, we had a really great back and forth with the staff.  They noted that they were selling products from a woman run business in Thailand(?) --- maybe it was Malaysia. =| A little out of the way from the hubbub unfortunately."
Telescope Coffee,Came for a quick trip to San Francisco - and this place ruined coffee for me. Absolustely INSANELY delicious espresso/latte; and pastry options. Now every morning I have to wake up 1800km away; and wish this place could deliver to Canada. Thanks Jenny! Great Shirts too!
Telescope Coffee,"What a treat Telescope Coffee was! The honey comb latte was excellent, not something that one would find easily in my home state of Ohio so it was a must order. Will also be trying that rose latte and maple latte during this San Francisco vacation. Excited to go back for the coffee and pastries :D"
Telescope Coffee,"Went out of my way on beautiful day to try out this sweet little coffee shop and incredibly glad I did. Friendly folks, delicious treats and drinks, I had the blondie + the gingersnap and chocolate chip cookie (don't skip this!), the rose latte and a refreshingly spiced chai. I found myself wishing for an outdoor bench or two as the immediate surrounding neighborhood has no visible public seating, though there are a couple of parks in walking distance."
Telescope Coffee,"We are obsessed with this place!! The lattes are unreal good, the pastries are some of the best we’ve ever had and my pup loves the home made dog treats. Do not miss this place."
Telescope Coffee,"Vegan options available, they have oat milk and coconut milk for their coffees and we got the vegan apple tart and focaccia. Friendly and fast service. Would recommend this coffee place, only downside is there is no outdoor seating."
Telescope Coffee,Had their famous Honey 🍯 Comb coffee after recommendation from a friend. Thought it was okay. …
Telescope Coffee,This place is so cute. I got a vanilla latte and it was sweet but not too sweet. They were super friendly and chatty while I waited. Love the aesthetic. Excited to come back and try some of the fall specials.
Telescope Coffee,"Tried the peach cream puff and honeycomb latte. Both were amazing! The peach cream puff had 2 different peach textures, and it smelled divine. Looking forward to trying their house made chai 😍"
Telescope Coffee,Oh god it’s so good please go get the honey crumble latte!
Telescope Coffee,"Really nice coffees, the team is the sweetest, a must go if you are in the area"
Telescope Coffee,"Fantastic little bakery & coffee shop, all home made. Had a great experience, if you happen to pass by just take a minute and enjoy something! I had their pumpkin bread, sublime! ❤️"
Telescope Coffee,"Awesome little spot. Work across the street and randomly saw them open one day. In an area with little to choose from in relatively close walking distance, I've found my new morning cup of coffee. I don't really eat pastries, but what she makes looks absolutely awesome."
Telescope Coffee,"If you love discovering cute little coffee nooks, supporting local small business, and enjoying insanely delicious baked goods with your drip coffee, this is a MUST STOP SHOP! From their savory cherry tomato sourdough foccacia to their jaw-droppingly gorgeous peach cream puffs, you've got the perfect spread to pair with your classic coffee house offerings or you can change it up and try their deeply rich Vietnamese phin filter coffee! I'm dying to go back and try their strawberry oat milk, or order another 10 cups of their honeycomb latte ;)  Let's see how many miniature astronaut figures you can find hiding away 👩‍🚀✨🔭  I'll see you there ;)"
Telescope Coffee,"The Honeycomb latte was delicious. Have tasted ( peach cream puff, the madellion, their amazing cake for a birthday). Great staff!"
Telescope Coffee,"Best little Latte spot, locally owned, the pastries and everything made on location with locally sourced ingredients. The honey-comb late has honey-comb with hints of local eucalyptus, what!?"
Telescope Coffee,Staff is so friendly and helpful. I get something new every time I go and every drink is delicious. Plenty of specialty drinks. Good variety of pastries too.
Telescope Coffee,They make a delicious homemade iced chai latte! I hate most of the concentrate mixes..this one was my fave in SF by far!

Telescope Coffee,"The baked goods are phenomenal, coffee is delicious, and the owner and staff are super friendly and offer great service every time. Happy to have them in the neighborhood!"
Telescope Coffee,One of the cutest coffee and pastry spots in Soma. The pastries are fresh & delicious and the owner bakes them all. Coffee is also decent.
Telescope Coffee,Really great coffee! Couldn’t try their pastries but they looked really good.
Telescope Coffee,"What a great vibe! We all got matcha there, and it was really good. The owner was there when we visited, and she was very kind and dedicated to making it a nice place to be."
Telescope Coffee,"Really good! The peach cream puff and the flan were both incredibly fresh, looking forward to heading back and trying more items on the menu."
Telescope Coffee,quite literally my favorite coffee shop in SF. everything about this place is the best
Telescope Coffee,The best shop ever! The owner is a Michelin starred pastry chef so the pastries are top notch and the drinks are equally delicious.
Telescope Coffee,Oh my god this my favorite spot for my morning pick me up and treat. The folks there are real warm and inviting you can't go wrong by stopping by. Support

Telescope Coffee,"The people here are incredibly nice— coffee is great too, but the humans will warm your heat"
Telescope Coffee,I love this coffee! There’s at least three other coffee shops within three blocks from here and I will choose this place over all of them.
Telescope Coffee,An out-of-this-world spot for coffee in SF's SOMA with delicious baked treats!
Telescope Coffee,Visiting from TX and found this little place. Damn it is so good. Drinks and pastries are so good. Looking forward to going back tomorrow

Telescope Coffee,New favorite morning coffee shop
Telescope Coffee,"A new cafe in the soma area. The owner is from San Francisco and worked at Michael Mina and eleven Madison park.  Purchased Vietnamese coffee and dessert. Both are delicious and not too sweet.  The only place to sit is on the benches outside, so take-out is the norm.  It was delicious so I went back the next day.  Honey comb latte is excellent. However, it will be much sweeter at the end, so it is recommended to mix it well or add milk at the end to drink it."
Telescope Coffee,The honeycomb latte was delicious. There are some milk alternatives! Very cute store.
Telescope Coffee,Milk roses!! ❤️❤️🙌🙌 …
