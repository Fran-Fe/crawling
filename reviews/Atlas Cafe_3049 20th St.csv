Atlas Cafe,"Cute coffee shop with good coffee. Came here at 8am in the morning seeking sustenance after a strenuous HIIT workout at the gym nearby. Very quiet in the morning but the barista was so nice and beaming with warmth. Lots of seat space and outlets for working and wifi is available. Love the relaxing music and decor. Cappuccino was a bit pricier than expected at a little more than $6 a cup, but did not disappoint. Would definitely come back to try the food!"
Atlas Cafe,"$50+ for a sandwich, salad and 1 coffee! Used to love this place. The beetloaf sandwich is now $16!"
Atlas Cafe,"Friendly folks, good seating  Tried the mushroom coffee thing and it was kind of awesome -- smooth and creamy. stay in cups have large portions for the drinks. good food selection. charming spot overall!"
Atlas Cafe,"Those is a nice place to have a fast bite by yourself or with companions. It's a great spot to work as well. The ambiance is great. Generally speaking, it is pleasant, peaceful, and clean. There is some interesting, effective wall art. There is also an option for outside sitting. You absolutely must try the personal pizzas. Additionally, the salads are wonderful. It is undoubtedly vegetarian-friendly. The diversity of (non-alcoholic) drink selections is what makes this establishment great. The ginger lemonade is strongly advised (it is quite ginger-y). The golden latte is wonderful."
Atlas Cafe,Thanks Ali! We love to hear you enjoyed it! 
Atlas Cafe,"Cute spot, good service. Food selection is a bit limited, but a good space to relax or work in. The back patio is lovely. The grilled cheese sandwich is solid but could use a stronger cheese."
Atlas Cafe,"This is my favorite cafe in San Francisco— the food is delicious and it has a great no-frills atmosphere. Whether you are vegetarian or not, you have to try the beetloaf— I’ve never had another sandwich like it. They also have a nice outdoor seating area and on Thursday/Friday nights they have jazz bands come in."
Atlas Cafe,"Been coming to this place for 15 yrs. Sadly the quality of their coffees has gone down since their revamp a few months ago. Also it's a hit or miss with their baristas, need more training on how to make the drinks if you serve $5+ espresso drinks."
Atlas Cafe,"A favorite spot to sit, read, work all while enjoying excellent coffee and a nice food menu. Have been coming here so long I can’t remember. One of the back in the day’s that has kept up with the Mission’s transformation."
Atlas Cafe,🙏💞
Atlas Cafe,I dropped in at Atlas bc I was dyeing for a cold drink.  I was pleasantly surprised that they have 3 vegetarian/vegan sandwiches to choose from! I had the tofu & chard on toasted whole grain bread and it was wonderful!  The whole place was bright and cheery.  If I lived in this neighborhood I would eat here all the time.
Atlas Cafe,"I ordered from the app ""too good to go"" and was really disappointed.  I received a small container of soup and two pieces of bread.  The value of this was supposed to be $12 +  The premise of this app is that it's food that is going to be left over or go to waste, totally not the case.  It's just a marketing ploy to get you in the restaurant.  Everyone got the surprise soup which is just a regular staple of the cafe."
Atlas Cafe,I’m sorry Alex you should have gotten a 16 oz soup and something else along with the soup and bread. I will check in with my staff about being sure the TGTG people get the full value.  But no it’s not a ploy we often have soup left over and if it isn’t gone by end of day it would go to waste. We stop serving soup at 5 and we make a fresh batch in the morning. Everything in the Too Good to Go bags is a regular staple of the cafe. What else would it be?
