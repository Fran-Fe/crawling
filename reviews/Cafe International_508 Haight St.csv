Cafe International,"This place should be protected at all costs. Got the bagel with cream cheese and avocado with all the fixins (sprouts, onions, tomatoes, and small serving of fruit) for $7.25, and a large mocha for $4.50.  Zahrah, the shop owner, was sweet and super genuine. Cafe International is an institution, supported by locals and keeping prices affordable despite being in the Lower Haight. Cash only with atm on site. This place is amazing (shop local!)"
Cafe International,"Decided to stop here because we passed by every morning. Had the bagel with lox, my friend had the bagel with egg. It was okay — not great. Wasn’t super fresh or tasty. Gave me a TON of coffee which was also meh. It looks cute but I wouldn’t stop in."
Cafe International,"This cafe was here b4 me, and I've been here 35 years. Such a great local place, and live jazz on Sundays. So great, you have to stop in."
Cafe International,"This place is an amazing hidden gem in Lower Haight, with the most relaxing backpatio! They have great coffee and a wide ranges of options for breakfast or lunch. It's my favorite local coffee in the neighborhood. I love the international feel, the welcoming and laid back owner who speaks many languages! Make sure to drop by there if you're around."
Cafe International,"I liked it a lot - it’s just a great space! Delicious house roast coffee!!! I got the bagel and hummus and they were perfect with little piles of veggies on the side. Reasonable prices, lovely and friendly service, and cozy seating and decor."
Cafe International,Thank you
Cafe International,"This place is an absolute gem!!! I came here for breakfast, super cool inside, good vibe all around. The lady at the register was super nice and funny! The avocado bagel I got was fabulous! House coffee was good. And everything was so reasonably price. This is a really good place to come and chill or work on your computer since there is also free WiFi. There is also a super cute backyard area with lots of plants and a beautiful mural. You can smoke in the backyard as well. Definitely recommend and definitely coming back!"
Cafe International,Thank you so much
Cafe International,"Went to check out this place on a Sunday and it was great! They had live music, a great atmosphere and lots of seating! Food was priced well and taste decent. Will definitely be coming back!"
Cafe International,Really groovy coffee shop! Lots of tables and also some super comfy sofas. Came in for a coffee 2go but stuck around because there was a local blues band playing awesome tunes inside!
Cafe International,"Nice victor.., come back soon if you have time 😃"
Cafe International,"The best place - wonderful, funky, an institution. Zahra is a mini sf celebrity, so sweet and funny and speaks like 14 languages. Food menu is much better than it looks."
Cafe International,"So I heard about this place from my employer. It's warm and inviting inside. Very spaceous, your able to find your own little spot of personal space. People converse with strangers others are sketching in notebooks, most stop in as their morning routine. The preprioter is warm friendly and inviting person. The menu is simple, with pastries and bagel sandwiches. Coffee or espresso drinks can be found here as well. Although the prices are more than reasonable for the city of rising cost. It is cash only. A ATM exist. That has a small fee if you need to get cash. I ordered a everything bagel with hummus and capers, and she didn't even charge me for the capers. In fact the veggies come free on every sandwich, also included is a small fruit cup. About the size of most to go condiments cups. Nice touches and excellent price compared to chain like Noah's, where it's be over 10 dollars for something similar."
Cafe International,Thank you so much 😊 I usually don’t read reviews .... but yours made me happy 😊
Cafe International,2 sandwiches $22.  Very unsatisying.  Over-priced.  Why so few chips?   Sandwich was all bread - no meat.  Also got an over priced crumb cake $5. Not fresh.  Also the only coffee shop I go to where my Internet has problems connecting.  The two stars are for the space and the staff unless they are the owners who are overcharging for their food.
Cafe International,"My first cafe experience in SF over a decade ago and still the best cafe in the city! Peaceful back patio with colorful tables, super friendly staff, good music, and strong iced coffee."
Cafe International,"Yelp and Google reviewers gave 4.5 stars for this place. I was a little disappointed. The almond milk Cafe latte was mediocre. I wanted it “extra extra hot”, it came tepid. The almond milk was too thin so it was like drinking weakly brewed coffee. My son ordered Turkish coffee and it came very sweet.  However he later said he could get used to it. Two things that were redeeming: 1. The staff was very friendly and sweet; 2. The back patio with painted frescoes was cute and nice place to sit."
Cafe International,"Outstanding in so many ways  Affordable - Cash only, but you know when a place is great it’s cash only and still people streams into.  $3.75 for mocha  Character -  Unapologetic in expressing they’re left-wing and anti-privilege.  So abundantly liberal it spills into their bathroom.  They probably forgot the Rastafarian mural and just put a mop in front of it.  Top it off… - Excellent deck garden - Murals and wall plants in the back - Live jazz music every weekend"
Cafe International,The latte was amazing and the person at the front was so welcoming and personable. Seems like the kind of place where the owner knows everyone's name
Cafe International,Very cool spot! Comfy chairs and a bright staff. The coffee wasn't great but the atomsophere more than made up for it.
Cafe International,We have a new blend.... coffee on the house:)
Cafe International,It is a good place to go. Purely my opinion. Food is reasonably price. Yum yum . I love my friends
Cafe International,"I met the sweetest, kindest woman working the register this morning. Her name is Zalah and she is the owner. Tasty breakfast sandwich and great coffee. I have found a new place for coffee when I'm in SF! #TenStars"
Cafe International,"I have been living in the neighborhood for over a year and pass by this place often. This morning I absolutely needed a bagel and a smoothie, and they sure delivered on that. Cozy interior with plenty of seating, including a sunny outdoor patio in the back. They have draft beer on tap as well (lagunitas my fav <3)  The very sweet lady at the register took care of me, and the man preparing the food/drinks was also very kind. Bagel was perfect, and the smoothie (#1 on the menu) was fresh and delicious.  10/10 would recommend and I see myself frequenting this place from now on."
Cafe International,"Great music spot for local artists. Live music on Sundays starting around 5 until close. They serve beer, wine, and coffee. The food is decent too."
Cafe International,Yup!! Listen to Michael
Cafe International,I used to call this place my backyard. I would go down for my morning tea sit in the backyard chat with the locals and with the Amazing owner Zahra when she had a second she's a busy woman after all. It's a San Francisco classic. Go Enjoy.
Cafe International,This seems to be the only place I found in San Francisco where you can smoke in the garden. They also seem to have a sense of humor. Coffee isn’t the best but I guess it depends what you’re looking for. Friendly staff.
Cafe International,"This place is a total gem! If you live or are visiting Lower Haight, soak up the unique, zany, and distinctively San Franciscan vibe and energy you'll receive from both the atmosphere and owner (Zara) of this wonderful establishment.  Pro tip: GREAT COFFEE, they don't skimp on it either, their ice coffees are served with ice cubes made of MORE coffee, it's like getting a double size but paying for a normal size  Pro tip #2: Get the pastrami sandwich on Dutch crunch, it's delicious, great ingredients and juicy good cuts of meet, generous portions  Pro tip #3: BEST FRESHLY SQUEEZED GRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGE JUICE YOU CAN GET IN THE CITY. I get one of these every time and it's amazing  Pro tip #4: Bring cash"
Cafe International,"Food is average, the jazz/vibe is better!"
Cafe International,"As a spoken word artist, Soul Brotha #9, I felt a bit less welcomed in the beginning by the band leader. I wish he could have prepared me for the stage or the stage for me. I'll be back because the applause was fantastic."
Cafe International,"We've fallen in love with this place. Great neighborhood coffee shop. Unpretentious, lots of space, outdoor smoke-friendly area, good music, community vibe. Owners are awesome too."
Cafe International,"I just love this spot. Fresh squeezed on, and other juices. Wonderful, big sandwiches,  great soup, back patio with a gorgeous mural. I love the owner ,zahra...best place for a stiff coffee. If you want it iced, she makes coffee ice cubes. My mom visits from Wisconsin,  those to are great friends ,as am i, since 1994."
Cafe International,I miss my morning coffee runs to Cafe International and chatting it up with Zahra (owner). Iced Coffee is the best with the coffee ice cubes. Truly my favorite spot for coffee and breakfast fare in the city!  Whenever I'm in the Lower Haight I make a point to stop by.
Cafe International,Nice place. Good selection of tea and pastries. Chill atmosphere. Live music was nice.
Cafe International,Thank you Alex.... we need more people like you ❤️
Cafe International,"Cool place! Nice interior, great pastry and huge cups of coffee. Had a full band playing live in the store at 1pm!"
Cafe International,"Great atmosphere, wonderful live music, good food! They made us feel like we were regulars right away. Will definitely be coming back! Thank you <3"
Cafe International,Friendly staff and good life music. Perfect to chill
Cafe International,Great place to have soup and listen to live music. Wish it were open later! So cozy
Cafe International,"My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco for getting work done. Lots of space indoors and outdoors, comfy chairs with wide tables, a fun aesthetic, good power outlets, good Wi-Fi, a bunch of different salads and sandwiches on the menu (freshly made to order), Turkish coffee, a graffitied but always clean bathroom, no time limit."
Cafe International,"Coffee is strong, it's large and quiet (at least on a Sunday morning) and there's a nice back patio. If you're allergic to tobacco smoke the patio  may not be the place for you. The owner is very friendly, welcoming, and outgoing.  I understand there's music in the evenings."
Cafe International,Thank you....we will limit the smoke if someone is allergic.... I know is impossible to please everybody but we can compromise
Cafe International,"Very friendly service.  Cash only but there’s an ATM machine inside Big tables, comfortable chairs, WiFi and power sockets against the wall."
Cafe International,"4.5⭐️ Cozy sofas, eclectic crowd and flippant/fun staff. Only the latte was a little weak."
Cafe International,Speak up and your latte will be as strong as you want it.... we probably wanted you to be able to sleep 👍🏿
Cafe International,"I never see a place with 100 on their health inspection score!! The owner is hilarious and very nice, the staff is sweet and caring, and the food as GREAT! Nice place to chill or have a drink. When it's not busy, it's also nice to work at. Definitely for playful attitude. (Cash Only though)"
Cafe International,"Love this place, it is an absolute institution and Zara always makes me feel welcome whenever I swoop in for a smoothie! Try the Max's special if you are going for breakfast and don't forget to bring cash!"
Cafe International,"For once I found a place that isn't pretentious and is 'what you see is what you get'.  The food is decent and relatively cheap compared to other places, the coffee is decent, but the atmosphere is what I like the most.  It's worn in, wabi-sabi, graffiti style art on the wall, cool couches, hardwood floors, just a cool and unique place.  There are open mic nights which bring interesting characters and stays open late. The people that go are amazing and are very welcoming to new people. I never felt so at home in SF.  Thanks for the good times and the hospitality."
Cafe International,Best Turkish Coffee and bagels in the city.
Cafe International,"Good vibes, live music on Saturday afternoon was a nice surprise"
Cafe International,The place is good enough but I couldn't get why the reviews seem excited about it. Basic neighborhood coffee shop.  Most of the furniture looks like goodwill - not that that's a bad thing.  Plus is the artwork was pretty cool but nothing extremely exciting.  I did like the murals in the men's room. I thought the deserts were a little on the pricey side but nothing out of line.
Cafe International,Well rich..... is not the place ... is what you see......I am sure you will find the place you will be excited about one day.... in the meantime thousands of people find us amazing....good for us...🧿
Cafe International,"This place is a dying breed when it comes to classic hang out spots in the Lower Haight. Friendly and authentic staff, good strong coffee, chill music. I come here to study/work as well as to grab a quick bite, and it's great for both purposes. Check out the cool mural in the back patio."
Cafe International,Sweet
Cafe International,"This is a really unique place that has been in this neighborhood for decades. The food isn’t particularly good—nor are the drinks. But this place more than makes up for it with neighborhood hospitality and cool events: they have an open mic night and frequently have live music. There’s also free WiFi, and a dog friendly back patio area. This place helped me decide to move to Lower Haight, and I’m glad I did."
Cafe International,Excellent tuna melt!  Very friendly staff and live Jazz! Will come back!
Cafe International,Sweet
Cafe International,Still Wonderful place with Great food and live music on the weekends at this lovely SF place. All Honor Zarah!
Cafe International,"The best Cafe' Shop I've been to, since I started riding a bicycle from Alabama to San Francisco. I've been ""hanging out"" here every day for the last week, and doing my best to support a ""locally owned"" small business.  The owner is an amazing individual who has a passion for sharing her culture with energy and enthusiasm. I've been to many, many coffee shops through my ride across the country, and none of them come close to this one.  Go Support Them! :)"
Cafe International,Thank you so much.... you almost made me cry..... that is huge because I tend to be cynical ....and not a cry baby 😂
Cafe International,"Really great coffee shop that has San Francisco written all over it. The espresso and drinks are really great and are fairly reasonably priced as well. The atmosphere is what really makes this place great though, it's always happening in here whether there's an open mic or jazz or whatever they want that night. You could be in here for hours and not even realize it. A great, classic San Francisco coffee shop for the Lower Haight."
Cafe International,"This cafe has been my second home for over 5 years and I can't recommend it enough for its delicious egg/bagel breakfast, iced coffee, coffee cake and amazing people. If you're in San Francisco, it's worth traveling to because you'll leave full of love and tasty food."
Cafe International,"Great Coffee Shop if you ever find yourself on lower Haight Street. Staff and customers are very friendly. They have good coffee, lentil soup & mediterrian. I have been coming here for almost 20 years and recommend this place if you want an authentic San Francisco coffee-shop experience."
Cafe International,"Fun, nice person made us feel right at home. Took our orders and even made me an iced green tea special. Good tunes on the speaker, calm vibe. Diverse group of customers. Love it here (who doesnt?!)"
Cafe International,Absolutely wonderful - be aware it is cash only!!!
Cafe International,"Funky and cool ""divey"" coffee house that has a limited menu (hot and cold sandwiches and soup)... They also have live events a few times per week (Jazz, open mic, etc.) There's also a nice secluded outdoor patio that is never all that crowded. My only complaint is that the coffee merely OK. It's not ""Blue Bottle"" or ""Stanza"" quality at all. Drinkable, yes! But there is much better coffee to be had in SF."
Cafe International,Wonderful place to chill and appreciate how international this Cafe is (in all the best ways).
Cafe International,Very nice place. Ate a roast pork sandwich that was delicious. The pea soup with bread you have to try. Excellent place. Thx so much.
Cafe International,The friendly atmosphere and the feeling that you are walking into your safe space. I love the people the coffee and the relaxation I get before my work day.
Cafe International,"Looked very chilled & relaxed till we were served. The lady behind the counter was so rude & obnoxious. Poor, poor customer service. One customer asked about what was on the Middle Eastern Mix Plate and her answer was ""Middle Eastern Food.""and walked away only to return later and be just as rude to us. We walked out and she yelled out ""excellent, excellent. That's how I like to do business. "" I think she was drunk."
Cafe International,OMG... I don’t remember that..... but everyone has a bad day...correct? Do you? Come back and I will apologize....or don’t come back a wish you a good life🧿
Cafe International,Choice relaxed and spacious venue for a spot of light lunch after walking the city. Beautifully presented falafels and comfortable seating with a very laid back ambience and free WiFi. Cool sounds in the background and a friendly service.
Cafe International,Thank you so much 😊....
Cafe International,"Very smart, social, and entertaining hostess, and lots of fun progressive political statements. Outdoor seating makes dining in (out) during covid possible. Interesting art and murals abound"
Cafe International,"I thought that the place was very cozy.  I went there because of a meeting invitation by the online language-learning program DUOLINGO for people learning Portuguese.  I'd not known about Café International before.  The woman (owner, maybe?) from whom I bought my coffee and donut was very friendly and treated her customers as ""special"".  It looked like they had a nice lunch menu, as well as breakfast."
Cafe International,Thank you
Cafe International,"Everybody loves Zahra! This place is the kind of place you want in San Francisco. A neighborhood institution. Great coffee, good food, and a very relaxed vibe. Can get beer and wine too. A community gathering space."
Cafe International,Thank you doc
Cafe International,"This is simply my favorite Cafe in the world. Yes, it's a bold statement, but it's true.  The coffee is incredible. Whether you're drinking hot, black coffee, cappuccinos, lattes, or whatever caffeine fix you need, you will be well taken care of. They have tasty, fresh, well-made products at a great price.  The salads, soups, pastries, smoothies, egg breakfasts, bagels, sandwiches, and everything else on their menu hits the spot. ALL the ingredients are fresh, delicious, and most importantly, made with love.  The wi-fi is quick, space aplenty, and a beautiful back patio. The cafe supports local artists, has open mic Friday, and Jazz on Sunday evenings. This place is magical.  And it's all because of Zahra and her incredible staff. Zahra (and the Cafe) are institutions in San Francisco and the Lower Haight. She is the sweetest, realest, and most loving person you will ever meet. Please take the time to have a quick conversation with her and your heart will be fuller, your day will be better, and you'll feel inspired to take on the day.  I love Zahra, I love the Cafe, and if you are ever in San Francisco, take a trip here to have a cup of coffee, some breakfast/lunch, and spend an hour or two relaxing in this magical place. You will be very happy you did."
Cafe International,OMG Alex ... they may think you are a friend of mine for writing such an amazing review....hope they don’t find out!!!!! Hi to Michelle...❤️
Cafe International,Jazz nite...good coffee ...place in back with beautiful mural where you can smoke
Cafe International,Fantastic food and super accommodating. Owner was very friendly. I highly recommend this great establishment
Cafe International,"THE food is simple,  tasty,  made to order.  Kid friendly atmosphere,  live music, Open Mix Friday nites,  big band Sunday afternoon.  Computer access,  friendly staff.  Unisex restroom,  pet friendly ."
Cafe International,"Zara, the owner, is one of the sweetest people you will meet and always takes care of you. I really like the vibe here, it's very San Francisco. Good coffee, good Meditteranean food, good prices. I wouldn't recommend it if you're hardcore about getting work done on the internet, but it's great to people watch and get a feeling for Lower Haight."
Cafe International,"I go here all the time. Zahra is the best. My favorite item are the smoothies. A friend of mine looooooves the Middle Eastern Plate. A lot of food for a good price.  It's a chill place, with fast wifi and even outlets (if you can sit near one).  They also serve alcohol and in the evenings there are various bands that play.  It's my main cafe and I'm a huge fan."
Cafe International,"Note: Cafe International is temporarily closed. Scheduled to reopen on April 1, 2019.  This review is from a previous visit.  Cash only. Zahra, the Uber friendly owner from Eritrea suggests using the ATM in the corner of the restaurant, and claims it has the lowest fees.  I tried the everything bagel sandwich with avocados, hummus, micro greens, tomatoes, onions - think deconstructed, along with a side of mini fruit salad.  Zahra asks me if I can set up a cute girl with a nose ring with a nice boy. You get how friendly the conversation gets.  The coffee was a little too sweet for my liking, but they had non dairy options. What do you expect with mocha.  They have more than your usual share of coffee options as well as breakfast sandwiches/bagels.  The place is a hippie paradise. The bathroom is covered in graffiti and scribbles that remind you of the Haight Ashbury heydays and nefarious plans to install world peace."
Cafe International,"Cafe International has the best baked tofu sandwich I've ever had!  The seasonings/sauce they use is unique, simple, delicious and light, and wonderful. Breakfasts are a treat; your bagel is served with hummus, sprouts, tomato and red onion sliced paper thin, and it comes with a fruit cup or some other side.  Who else serves a bagel and hummus with a side?  They have a wide variety of sandwiches, smoothies, bakery treats, etc.  Zara (Zhora?) is warm and efficient at the same time, gladly substituting whatever is usual for whatever they got.  The coffee is great.  The decor is, as one other reviewer said, quintessentially San Francisco - and real, not the simulacrum found in many trendy places.  The old ""Fillmore's"" sign is still mounted on the wall above the free periodicals shelf.  The floors are worn and beautiful, local artists hang their works on the wall.  They have mix-and-match tables, chairs and coffee mugs.  No, it's not ""Starbucks pretty.""  It's really pretty.  There's internet access, of course.  Have I mentioned prices?  Downright reasonable.  In fact, I don't know how she does it.  And they have backyard seating!  The patio is decorated with well done murals by talented artists.  This is my favorite lazy morning or afternoon hangout, even though I've moved to the Mission District now."
Cafe International,"The place is currently CLOSED for renovation. The sign says it was expecting to open some time in Feb, but as of Mar 3rd 2019 it's still closed and empty inside. EDIT x Zahra: Thanks for the info. 5 stars without visiting seemed unfair. 1 star for being close for renovation seemed also unfair. But people should now this place is temporarily closed and there's no way I found to leave a comment without putting some number of stars .. :) Looking forward to visit it when it opens back and revise it!"
Cafe International,"Landlord retrofitting the building and Ada required...so everybody can come....we should get a 5 stars for making the place safe....soon to be open.... .. and Simon Pagan ., come on why the 3 stars? For been closed? Zahra"
Cafe International,"spacious cafe but music is a bit loud esp. if you don't like reggae. informed owner about internet dropping in and out and she just gave me a phone number to call, which i just got a voice message. probably won't come back.."
Cafe International,"Great food, nice neighborhood spot. Free local music at night as well! Still a Wonderful place in the Lower Haight"
Cafe International,🧿
Cafe International,The last time I was here was over 15 years ago and it's still the same. Great customer service and great food and coffee. Looking forward to going back again on my next visit to SF.
Cafe International,"This place is awesome!! I was looking for a good spot to get some work done and cafe international killed it with the fast wifi, comfy seats, and calming music :)"
Cafe International,"Very nice people.  Fantastic vibe.  Ordered Lemon ginger tea and they gave me the teabag, but they also gave me fresh ginger and fresh lemon. Very comfortable to sit down. Nice crowd."
Cafe International,So happy a little ginger means so much.... I will continue to do my best
Cafe International,"I just had the worst coffee in San Francisco! The soup had whole unground pepper in it. Not very pleasant. Some dried out, overpriced falafel. Rude guy on the counter. This city has so many fine cafés; can't imagine why anyone would waste their time at this place."
Cafe International,I hope you find your niche...Greg ... we didn’t miss you 😘
Cafe International,"What a cool spot. Loved the live jazz on Sunday afternoon by ""Miles Ahead"" from 4-9pm. Worth checking out, very San Franciscan vibe here."
Cafe International,"Very basic place, no frills but good quality coffee and a very nice woman working there.  Nice vibe overall.  My only suggestion is they somehow improve their lighting because it's pretty bad."
Cafe International,You are so right.... I have been thinking about upgrading the lighting for the last 27 years.... Maybe the time is here....
Cafe International,The food is inexpensive and tasty! The space is calming and creative with fantastic music playing regularly. And the staff is so considerate and friendly. Thank you!
Cafe International,Love you too doll ❤️
Cafe International,I’ve played at two open mic nights now and everyone is lovely. Such a great atmosphere and good beer and staff as well!
Cafe International,Coffee is burnt tast old
Cafe International,The latte is horrible!!! Worst ever. LOL
Cafe International,"Large space and A lot of food choices.  Lovely inviting back patio, with clean wooden tables.  Friendly staff; they take care of you."
Cafe International,"Love this place.  It's one of the last vestiges of the genuine, old Lower Haight.  Good food.  Fresh OJ.  Zara is the queen of the neighborhood!"
Cafe International,Thank you Rob.... there is room for a king too....😂
Cafe International,Great Ambiance and a lovely outdoor patio where smokers don't get scowl. Excellent coffee selection and the food was delicious not to mention the great customer service
Cafe International,😃
Cafe International,"Fairly straight cafe, but free jazz on Sunday evening makes this a standout place. Patio just behind the band, and you are outside and may smoke."
Cafe International,"Fantastic place, I made Cafe International my second home while I'm in SF. Try the tofu sandwich. The staff is funny and very friendly, love it."
Cafe International,Great spot for a quick bite or a cup of coffee in their amazing back yard. Owner is an amazingly warm lady who clearly loves her shop and patrons.
Cafe International,You got that right my man😊
Cafe International,The ceaser salad came drenched with dressing the croutons were soggy and they add strawberries? The bagels were not good today 😕
Cafe International,"Just wow. Laid-back vibe, spacious and cool. I felt very welcomed and at home. Thank you Cafe International and keep doing your thing!"
Cafe International,Awww so happy to hear that👍🏿
Cafe International,Lovely local coffee shop.  Nice people.
Cafe International,Internet is janky. Don't come here expecting to get work done as the music is often loud. Back patio looks like a great place to hang though.
Cafe International,Loved the vibe!! Made me feel right at home and had delicious food and coffee!
Cafe International,"Funky vibe, great food, awesome staff.  Great spot to get some work done, or hang on the back patio with friends."
Cafe International,That is why we opened the café .... community ❤️
Cafe International,"Real and original San Francisco Haight Street at its best. Great coffee, excellent food with loads of tables, chairs and sofas to draft your next beatnik manifesto."

Cafe International,"really good expresso, nice staff, funny sound and open wifi. A nice place to work, checking mails or just hanging around with friends. btw the cakes are awesome!"
Cafe International,"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, open spacious and comfortable seating.  Has wifi, outdoor seating and a good variety of food network drinks."
Cafe International,"Let´s face it, this is not the fanciest of the fanciest places for coffee or dinner but the homey and nice staff will make you feel at home. their coffee is ok but their sandwiches are a nice option."
Cafe International,"Spacious place with a wide selection, patio in the back... And they have live music ( not sure what nights/days) this was on a Thursday..."
Cafe International,Coolest and most friendly café in the Haight. It’s always a great atmosphere and cheap but good food.
Cafe International,Sweet
Cafe International,"It's a lovely atmosphere, particularly the courtyard area."
Cafe International,Awesome service and food. Carrot cake recommended
Cafe International,I miss this place so much.  Whenever I am back in San Francisco I stop by for a coffee and amazingly no matter how long I have been away Zhara remembers my name which always made this little café feel like a home away from home.
Cafe International,Good place for coffee! The place has been there for years. Appreciated the Ethiopian lady who speaks Spanish.
Cafe International,"Really chill place, open mic nights on Friday with very supportive and talented people listening and performing, and 420 friendly outdoor smoke area <3"
Cafe International,"The tuna sandwich is pretty good! The tea, however, is disappointing -- it tasted like the tea bag has been used before."
Cafe International,"Great cafe food, drink, live music. Family and local vibe. Amazing staff!"
Cafe International,Thank you

Cafe International,Always
Cafe International,"The food, the vibe, and the service is great all around! The cherry on top is the owner, Zahra, and her savage jokes ❤️!!"
Cafe International,"Good, reasonably priced food in generous portions. Friendly staff. WiFi but didn't find any outlets."
Cafe International,Sunday jazz is a must. Help's you recharge after another crazy week. Put's a spring in your step for the next.
Cafe International,The owner has cemented her establishment as a mainstay in the historic Haight/Fillmore district. Feels like home away from home.
Cafe International,I will do even better!! Thank you
Cafe International,"Lovely little cafe. They do jazz on Sunday evenings, highly recommended!"
Cafe International,Strictly cash only…Was really looking forward to eating here!
Cafe International,"Good food, friendly staff. The Bert's not bad either."
Cafe International,"Very homie setting, mugs and couches. Take public trans. Parking is near impossible. Great coffee though so worth it"
Cafe International,fun place in a great location. I come here when i want to feel like I'm getting off the beaten path.
Cafe International,"Great atmosphere, food and coffee. Great place to meet people. Good food."
Cafe International,they have good sandwiches and a nice atmosphere but seems a bit dirty.
Cafe International,Is not dirty ... just old.... would you like us to polish the place and make it look fancy.....a lot of people maybe upset.... thousands of people like it the way it is;)
Cafe International,Has jazz a few nights a week - really awesome atmosphere and nice people.
Cafe International,Great and affordable food. Friendly staff as well!
Cafe International,"Not as good as it used to be, miss when they were on 24th, bigger pastries and breads, the food is still good though."
Cafe International,"Cinnamon cappuccino was divine, service was wonderful."
Cafe International,It's my fav.  The spot and the people are just as genuine and generous as you can find
Cafe International,"Great place to hang out and chill, you can smoke in back patio.."
Cafe International,A great and friendly neighborhood cafe. I highly recommend the Turkish Coffee.
Cafe International,Nice
Cafe International,"Awesome food, great coffee. And a wonderful open mic"
Cafe International,"Great place for a coffee on lower haight, but be aware that this place frequently closes up to an hour and a half before its' posted hours."
Cafe International,Cute little Cafe with a lot of character. Wish I had stayed longer
Cafe International,"I love the live shows, great food, and good hospitality."
Cafe International,Love the avoocado and cheese sandwich and smoothies!
Cafe International,My favorite is the prosciutto sandwich on Dutch bread. I have ordered it twice now and it's been great both times.
Cafe International,"Great coffee, and believe me it's really hard to find a decent coffee in the states."
Cafe International,❤️
Cafe International,"Interesting little place to take a drink and hangout. Lower haight is a place that full of these kind of places, enjoy"
Cafe International,one of the last real cafes in SF. super nice just don't be in a hurry
Cafe International,Always a good vibe and a smile. This place is the soul root of Lower Haight!
