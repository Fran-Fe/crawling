Goody Cafe,"If you are at Fort Mason or passing by, Goody Café has hot and cold drinks and food (freshly baked treats, quiches and dessert)! I stopped by for some hot cocoa on a chilly Sunday morning after gathering fresh fruits and vegetables at the farmers market. A nice indoor space to sip a beverage, recharge, read and/or relax."
Goody Cafe,"Food was wonderful, and staff was friendly and helpful! I did however order a latte and it was 3/4 full, so that was disappointing as the small is already quite small for the price! Likely won’t be visiting again however it was a nice place to stop in!"
Goody Cafe,"Ran across this place and what a gem.  Food was great, service was quick and friendly, and it impressed me that the music playing was an album of early Black Sabbath.   Very cool place!"
Goody Cafe,Beautiful and cozy cafe. Felt extremely welcome and at home here while eating brunch. Had a fantastic chocolate crumb cake and pesto panini.
Goody Cafe,"Simple and unassuming Cafe serving hot handmade Cafe favorites like Chai, American, and espresso. Cold canned drinks available, and a few wraps in a fridge.  Staff were nice, but focused on making tasty drinks.  Inside old amry building. Decor was minimal with a chalkboard for kiddos to enjoy."
Goody Cafe,"Charming, very accessible, and great coffee. Don’t expect to enjoy your goodies inside, as there’s not a lot of seating, but there is outdoor seating available. Nice quiet vibe while you’re waiting for your coffee, with some interesting art on the walls."
Goody Cafe,Superb flavours  Don't miss the lavender and rose latte
Goody Cafe,"Hip cafe with high quality coffee, breakfast burritos, paninis, and pastries. Cold brew with oat milk was perfect balance of rich and creamy. Bacon breakfast burrito was freshly grilled and quite delicious!"
Goody Cafe,I love Goody Cafe so much. Best coffee shop in SF
Goody Cafe,I love Goody Cafe! It is such a hidden gem for locals (and visitors) with so many great options and some really inventive coffee drinks/food.
Goody Cafe,"Great vintage place attached to a huge library full of art books, I feel like at home ❤️"
Goody Cafe,"Love their sign on their boiled eggs.  ""An Egg"".  Generally good experience here, but DO NOT ORDER AN ESPRESSO.  Was there one Sunday morning, ordered an espresso, walked outside and tasted it, tried it once more just in case I had to develop a taste for it, and it was nowhere near edible.  Bitter as hell.  I brought it back, and the woman said ""Espressos are bitter"".  I said, no, I make them myself and have them at other places, and this is downright bad.""  They gave me my money back."
Goody Cafe,"A very charming place off the beaten path. Built into a book shop this is the perfect place to get started on a new novel, while sipping a cup of hot joe. Plenty of good pastries and hard boiled eggs also available. Wonderfully down to earth and casual atmosphere."
Goody Cafe,"I was in the area and hungry, so my mom and I stopped by to get a snack.  I got a Quiche Lorraine and a spinach/cheese quiche.  They were delicious!  I just needed a nibble to keep me until dinner, and eating half did it.  The rest were for my parents.  The cafe area is small, but it's connected to a bookstore so it feels more open.  I would come back here again if I was attending an event at Fort Mason and needed something to eat, as there isn't a lot of places to eat in that area (when the food trucks aren't there)."
Goody Cafe,I used to really like this place. The scones started going down hill recently and it was my favorite part. I'd come often and see the same folks behind the counter. I tried being friendly bc they clearly recognize me but never got anywhere. So now it's not worth going especially having to interact with the stone cold punk duo.
Goody Cafe,Wouldn’t give me a cup of tap water with my order lol
Goody Cafe,My favorite place. Honey lavender latte with oat milk. You're welcome. Don't be tempted by the chain Cafe at the entrance!
Goody Cafe,"latte!  honey lavender how sweet to the ears and tongue arrives like a plane  touch down on palate luscious, lively, nuanced, fresh nummy nummy num"
Goody Cafe,"Charming little cafe run by marvelous humans. Grab a drink, a snack, a table, say hello to the fish, check out the local art on the walls, and listen to the excellent records. The Holy Trinity: Coffee, Books, Music."

Goody Cafe,"Great staff, better drinks, food is economical. Great for coffee dates and meetings. Go here all the time. Love this place."
Goody Cafe,There is a better one. Only 1 block away. I'm sorry much better!!!! With more then 1 worker that can serve more than one customer at a time.
Goody Cafe,"Great baked goods, friendly staff.  I always stop by anytime I am in the area for one of the best almond croissants ever."
Goody Cafe,"Cute, small, attached to a used book store... Mexican mocha. What more could you want? I saw people eating all sorts of small lunchy things too."
