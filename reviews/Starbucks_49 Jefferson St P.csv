Starbucks,I got my 6 shots of expresso over ice 🧊 was delicious
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,"Poor service. Only 2 people were available at the store despite the store being located on the busiest street, one for billing and one for preparing the order so it was too crowded because the wait time was too long. they were not accepting cards for payment only cash or Starbucks app."
Starbucks,"Just a normal Starbucks. Quite Touristic, not a nice place to sit. Coffee was good. Service acceptable."
Starbucks,Terrible attitude of a this staff as she wont give me her name. She made my order wrong in the first place but she was not humble and has a terrible attitude. Staff like this should not be in Starbucks as they are well known for happy and great customer service.
Starbucks,"This is a very busy place, I recommend you place an app order prior to going here. The drinks and food are your standard Starbucks stuff, we ordered at this location multiple times while on vacation. But each time we made sure to order ahead. They have a restroom line next to the order line which can be an issue when it's full. But nonetheless it's still a good place to pick up your drinks on your way to the pier."
Starbucks,"The place was well-designed to make good use of space, you felt that the inside was bigger than the outside. Standard Starbucks coffee and decor."
Starbucks,"The most empty Starbucks I’ve ever visit… almost nothing to eat, nobody doing stuff in expensive MacBooks…."
Starbucks,Wifey had to buy coffee and we found this Starbucks on Jefferson & Powell just a few minutes walk from Pier 39 while on route to Fisherman's Wharf. Typical Starbucks service and coffee. There was a short line and order was quick. Inside this Starbucks was pretty big and roomy but I don't recall seeing lounge chairs at this location. It's more of a bar type seating for quick turnaround. Place is clean with ambient lighting.
Starbucks,Restroom wait is ridiculous. For this busy location they should have at least 6 restrooms.
Starbucks,"Clean bathroom, sink is outside it so you can just wash your hands without needing to wait.  3 long tables to sit at and warm inside on a cold day."
Starbucks,It is impossible to pay by card. No change for cash paymant!
Starbucks,Close to the water and super friendly and efficient staff.  Lots of people working and got our drinks quickly.  Even got a free drink because they were training staff.  Was a popular visit on our vacation and before we headed to the Pier.
Starbucks,Easily the poorest service I've ever gotten. Wish my tip could get refunded.
Starbucks,This place is always busy except if you come in early .... that is if you're a morning person. The staff are nice and friendly most especially the awesome manager. Super nice and friendly. She'll really take her time to make sure you're getting the great service the customers deserve.
Starbucks,They didn't have medicine ball or the tea we wanted.  Should be stocked up for customers.  They were out of a lot of product
Starbucks,Love it or hate it but it's the most consistent coffee wherever I am in the world.
Starbucks,"1st off I found a ring on the ground and turned it in to lost and found. They have Great customer service, perfectly satisfying options, free wifi to get last minute work done, good music, fast pace and terrific location just about the pier."
Starbucks,Great location.  Right by Pier 39.  Simply amazing!
Starbucks,"Glad to find them open so early. Coffee is just OK, wooden chairs horribly uncomfortable and the music is annoyingly loud. Not the usual pleasant Starbucks experience."
Starbucks,"Don't go here.  I've been a loyal Starbucks customer for 16 yrs.  On my visit to SF went 2x to this location.  The music was so defeaningly loud that baristas had to scream out when orders are ready.  All the baristas looked stressed even when things slowed down.  Also, my two orders were totally wrong!  The order label was  not on the cups.  When I asked to have a refund it took a bit of doing.  Other customers whom we talked with said they wouldn't come back.  Perhaps this store has too many tourists and doesn't need repeat customers.  Went back a second day just to make sure this wasn't an outlier.  It wasn't.  Worth walking to Starbucks at Fisherman's Wharf...so much nicer."
Starbucks,"Fast service, lovely staff. There was this one barista who was very nice but I didn't get her name. 5 stars for you unknown barista!"
Starbucks,I never go to get coffee and normally get it free at work or when I'm at a hotel but this time I decided to splurge. I ordered a Chai tea latte and a brownie that came just as fast as I ordered it. That was the best $8 I ever spent lol.
Starbucks,"I walked in to pick up my mobile order from the tray and I was yelled at, called rude in front of other customers, and embarrassed by a barista with big gold glasses and a beauty mark on his face. Not ok."
Starbucks,Were extremely rude to both my friends one who is from Mexico and the other is Jewish. Will never go back to ANY starbuck's in ANY city EVER!!!!
Starbucks,"Hello, thank you for alerting us to this. Rest assured we don't want anyone to have a negative experience, and our team would love to discuss this further. Please choose your preferred method of communication through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs) for assistance."
Starbucks,"The manager there Mr. Sung is a deplorable, most rude, and unprofessional human being. He closed the store at 6pm. I was inside already waiting for my order. I needed to use the bathroom while I waited and he denied me the use of it. He asked me to go use the city public bathroom across the street which had about 10 people in line waiting. I begged him to please let me use the bathroom as I was on medication that makes you use the bathroom frequently and he became more aggravated, dismissive, and condescending. This guy is the most disgusting excuse of a human being with absolutely, no heart, nor customer service skills. How starbucks made this abomination a manager is beyond me. By his employees are a direct reflection of him."
Starbucks,"I am ok to wait on the line, if a store works properly. But come on, you are on the most tourist attracted street and only one employee was working at the cashier. I waited 20 minutes to just order! And Starbucks mobile application doesn't allow me to put a Mobile order since my account location is in Canada. But I can pay with app. That shouldn't be a problem!"
Starbucks,"Long lines and higher prices, but only two employees. This place operates at the pace of a supermarket kiosk but with the demand of fisherman's wharf. Clean and very nice decor, but still not a great place to get a drink unless you're okay with waiting 15 minutes. It's like this every time I go in there, too, not just on a busy day. Also the Starbucks app doesn't work here for some reason."
Starbucks,"An older lady was very unprofessional and rude! I can’t believe Starbucks would hire people this unprofessional. while handing out my drink, she called me a what i think is a slur under her breath.  Never coming back here again!!!"
Starbucks,"Been to this Starbucks twice while on vacation. The 1st time I watched a guy flirt with one of his employees before he started making drinks. Once he started he somehow missed mine and the person before me’s order. Unhappy with this service I gave them another chance since it was only a min walk from my hotel. This time I watched one guy focus on making hot drinks while this girl made the cold drinks. The guy making the hot drinks was very focused and fast at doing so. The girl on the other hand, I had to watch finish something before beginning to make the cold drinks and she was taking her sweet time. So unhappy with the service because they obviously didn’t go by first come first serve. I watched four people who ordered after me get their drinks 1st because it was a hot beverage. I unfortunately ordered a cold drink so I waited what seemed forever for my drink. The employee knew I was unhappy and I made sure she did. I’m a huge fan of Starbucks and never had issues with their service until now. Not sure if it’s because this Starbucks is in a different country and they’re taught differently but their service needs to be changed. Soooo unimpressed!"
Starbucks,"They work on a three man crew,  this team knocks it out of the park. Being in a popular tourist area, you should expect a little bit of a wait but they surprised me with their promptness.  I've been to Starbucks in nearly every state and this location made my handcrafted beverage flawlessly."
Starbucks,"Not a bad location to do some work with views over the wharf. Staff were polite however spent most of the time I was having my order taken talking amongst themselves. Inside was neat and clean and as you would expect from a Starbucks, although it was a little disconcerting to see someone across the street injecting themselves in broad daylight whilst I was drinking my coffee. Whilst this is not Starbucks’ fault, I would be careful entering and leaving the store alone or in the evening as there were a lot of people hanging around outside."
Starbucks,Love this place. Fast service and you get the right order you order. Very helpful in explaining the different drinks.
Starbucks,Barista and cashier are super rude. Stayaway from that Starbucks at 49th. People shouldn't work at Starbucks if you felt bad for yourself at great place of customer interaction everyday at Starbucks. Be great and nice.
Starbucks,Didn't get what I ordered and was told I have to purchase again if I wanted something else. Barista was super rude
Starbucks,Good place to see the wharf. Although staff should be more aware on how their wooden chairs makes so much screeching noise when moved. Stayed here after a long hike and a lady staff arranging chairs couldn't care less to lift chairs to lessen the noise. A staff briefing would really be helpful for this branch
Starbucks,Coffee is good but the place is very dirty :/
Starbucks,Best Starbucks I have had. Tasted great 🤙🏽 Service was fine. Wait was above average. The lone for the toilet was longer than the line to order.
Starbucks,"Terrible service. Ordered two coffees together, my wife got hers and I had to wait 20+ mins for mine. I politely asked the waiter who assured me they will make it straight away. No sign of my coffee until I had to remind him I was waiting. No apologies for lack of service."
Starbucks,"There are always lines here, not always because there are many customers, but because there are not enough servers behind the counter.  I don't know if they have budget limits or no one is applying, but this Starbucks can use more servers."
Starbucks,"It's just another Starbucks really, but I was particularly a fan of their free drinking water for guests located near the stand with the sugar, lids, etc. The water is ice cold and super refreshing on sunny days along the pier!"
Starbucks,This was such a disappointing experience.  Ordered four drinks.  The child's hot chocolate and the quad venti breve were reversed.  They remade the hot chocolate.  They dumped the breve into a venti cup and handed it over.  They had already charged for the venti hot chocolate and said they would have to charge more for more milk in the breve.  The white peppermint latte ended up being just steamed milk.  Over 30 minute wait and one drink was correct.
Starbucks,"Finally, we have one near pier 39.  Place looks awesome & staff are very friendly."
Starbucks,With this new Starbucks added to fisherman wharf for a total of three locations within walking distance. This one is less than a week old furnished with repurpose shipping containers line with live plants above. International travelers can recognizethe green and white mermaid signage from far away. To me it's just a starbucks where you go get your fix and leave. Pastry samples were alright and coffee pretty much the same. Nothing much going on here other than a coffee shop with most clientele being tourist.
Starbucks,"My favorite is the bacon Gouda breakfast sandwich. The morning bun is a great desert or treat. On a hot day I opt for the iced latte, on a cold day the grande hot latte. My daughter enjoys the coffee frappucino, venti of course. The fruit and nut pack is another family favorite. My wife is calorie conscious so she has a drip coffee with honey, and skim milk."
Starbucks,Just buy some bagle with cheese . It was good nice simple breakfast and the egg white  with spinach  is good to.
Starbucks,"Worst place I think I have ever been for a bite to eat and iced coffee. Staff very rude food terrible iced coffee nowhere near what I would expect.  Stale donuts as well. When asked could you change it answer, thats the way they are. Avoid!"
Starbucks,Nice and clean.  Everyone working there was pleasant to interact with.
Starbucks,"Love a Starbucks coffee, handy to the hotel I was staying in"
Starbucks,Always great coffee like Australia
Starbucks,Good place to enjoy your coffee & snacks.
Starbucks,"Quick service, nice and clean. Friendly staff."
Starbucks,Only one staff member actually making coffee.  At least three other staff on site.  Customers waiting in line approx 10.  Customers waiting on orders approx 6.
Starbucks,The manager or he seemed to be in charge. Tried to tell me that I couldn't order the drink the way I wanted and tried to charge me for a more expensive one
Starbucks,"Fast and friendly, it seems like a packed place, but the employee's are so fast and knowledgeable that the line quickly diminishes."
Starbucks,"Friendly service. The location is actually wrong though, it’s on the other side of the road"
Starbucks,Really great drink was messed up they fixed it and made me a extra one for family al lb. FREE. SUPER SWEET.

Starbucks,"We are a little sorry that we have to go to an impersonal chain for afternoon coffee and dessert, with somewhat inattentive and erratic staff. Otherwise, decent coffee, a snack with a nice view at reasonable prices. Cafe culture is simply missing here"
