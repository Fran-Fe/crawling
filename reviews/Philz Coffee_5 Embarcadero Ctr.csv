Philz Coffee,I loved their coffee ! So perfectly blended and minimal wait time .
Philz Coffee,"Great spot to get coffee, Philz style. It's not your standard coffee bar, they don't do lattes or cappuccinos. You get delicious filtered coffee, freshly brewed just for you. I love the Mint Mojito, creamy, unsweetened. Their almond croissants are amazing, get them warmed up for an upgrade in your experience 🥐💕"
Philz Coffee,"Best iced coffee in town! You must order their ice coffee mint mojito, won't find anywhere else then in SF!"
Philz Coffee,"Cute little place, pleasantly placed. Outdoor seating is alright. It's handily near a bart station too. Pretty atmosphere as well."
Philz Coffee,"Phliz is consistent everywhere you go on the west coast. Everything is made to order and fresh! Reasonably priced, outside of the lines you can’t go wrong for a quick drink or even if you need some space to do a bit of work."
Philz Coffee,"This place was awesome - the best brewed coffee I have ever tasted! The setup of the store, the ambience, the service, and mostly the quality of the coffee was just incredible. I loved how they take their time in making your drink to perfection. My barista was very nice and helped me navigate the choices given this was my first time there. I tried the Tesora (with cream but no sugar) and would suggest this blend for all medium roast coffee lovers. Highly, highly recommended!"
Philz Coffee,The good ratings are definitely not for the coffee taste...tastes like gas station coffee tbh
Philz Coffee,"I fall in love with their coffee. I must say that there is no other place in the world that even close to the uniqueness of their coffee. And this particular branch is my go to Philz, located only one block away from my office. They also have a few outdoor seating here."
Philz Coffee,"My wife and I were visiting SF and we saw wanted to stop by to find some good coffee. We found Philz Coffee and read a lot of good things from review and friends and thought that we would give it a try. We ordered the Iced Mint Mojito Coffee to try something different. I was amazed at how great this worked. The coffee was smooth and when getting to the mint, it had a nice refreshing taste! I would definitely order it again and also would recommend this as the staff was great and the ambiance was very relaxing!"
Philz Coffee,"This was a wonderful stop for breakfast and a cup of delicious coffee. The line was out the door, but definitely worth the wait. We ordered the avacado toast and a breakfast wrap that were both delicious. The pour over coffee was awesome, will definitely go back to Philz when in the bay area."
Philz Coffee,"I asked for a recommendation close to an iced latte, but I got a hot coffee with barely any milk. Chairs and tables are arranged terribly too."
Philz Coffee,"The rose coffee sucked , but I liked the plant-based breakfast sandwich."
Philz Coffee,I agreed to buy a homeless man breakfast and the barista literally told me I couldn’t. He wasn’t harassing anyone 😔 …
Philz Coffee,"This was my first time at a Philz Coffee. I ordered a dirty chai, which i normally don’t get to order because they’re all pre-sweetened mixes or strips, and I don’t like mine sweet.  I get the order, and it’s just a chai latte. I went back up to the front and the ladies explained to me that they don’t have espresso here but that they were happy to add some coffee to my chai.  I said that would be awesome, and that they could just pour off some chai and top it off.  She ended up just remaking my drink and letting me know that she’d be happy to make me something else if I didn’t like it. I liked it just fine! Experience was great. And they had candy out for Halloween!!"
Philz Coffee,Location - 5/5 ( Approachable location ) Entrance - 5/5 Staff - 5/5 Quality - 5/5 Quantity - 5/5 Value for money - 5/5 ( All beverages are worth it but food section is super expensive ) - Washroom is decent. - Inside gets little crowded so you can enjoy sitting outside.
Philz Coffee,I had the Plant Powered Sandwich that tasted great!
Philz Coffee,I was positively surprised - being a cappuccino fan I could have been really disappointed-l only brewed coffee here! But the taste of the different brewed coffees and the added spices make it something unique and different from the crowd of cafes. I found also the pastries pretry good and a bit different as well feom the masses. I recommend trying it at least once to check if it could be a nice variation for you too.
Philz Coffee,"best cup of coffee I’ve had in my life, no joke. Didn’t expect that at all. Staff were great and the business flow was amazing. Highly recommended!"
Philz Coffee,Great coffee individually crafted and refreshing flavors. Lines is huge so order ahead of time using their phone app and beat the crowd
Philz Coffee,"The service here is incredible! I came here to study and write my paper during finals, and am so glad I did. The coffee here is always consistent and made to order. I always get the tesora blend. Absolutely delicious!"
Philz Coffee,"Nice coffee shop with outdoor seating, clean toilets and great staff. Ask for ceramic mugs to prevent waste. Water for free as well AS wifi. I liked Philz iced tea!"
Philz Coffee,Great Chai and the Iced Coffee Rose was super cool with the pink tinted cream was tasty and cool looking too!
Philz Coffee,Every single item I tried here was so good. Best to worst: Veggie quiche - heartwarming delicious filling with warm bread covering Almond croissant - unique item with sweet juicy bread Blueberry muffin - soft and spongy Butter croissant - simple but you can really taste the butter among the slightly crispy layers Cinnamon bun - average but had a generous amount of raisins All the ingredients seem to be high quality and the service was very polite.
Philz Coffee,I just loved going here. The barista was awesome. I thought his attitude and behavior was so welcoming. The staff were friendly and always smiling. The coffee tasted amazing!
Philz Coffee,"Philz is still the king of the pour over...At the more trendy, exclusive cafes, they do pour overs like it's always been a thing, but Philz got it lit. When combined with a large array of full flavored coffee, the pour over technique and Philz combine for a cup that's worth the $6."
Philz Coffee,"I will definitely re-visit here for Mint mojito coffee. Seats are limited, so i recommend you to take a coffee out."
Philz Coffee,this location is my part of walk to office routine. use app to order my drink about 40 min before there. you can pick up right on time. sometime I still need to wait for couple min but still accurate from reserved time.
Philz Coffee,"If you enjoy a normal coffee, don't come here. Very light coffee. Weird and simple sandwich. I asked for a “bagel everything” and i got an empty bagel with 2 pots of cream cheese. It may be a cultural thing. I don’t recommend it."
Philz Coffee,This place was so good! It was recommended to me by someone who used to live in the bay area. I'm bummed because it was so good and we don't have any where I live! They are also super helpful if you are new. They let you taste the coffee to make sure they made it right.
Philz Coffee,"Friendly service, excellent tea and coffee. There are a few great reasons Philz is famous--they do what they do well."
Philz Coffee,Best coffee around.  Although they just switched up the blends.  My favorite didn't make it.
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee is worth the wait. I typically meet at this location for business coffee conversations.  Plenty of seating outside and a great cup of coffee.   It usually takes around 10 minutes to order and get your coffee, but I find the quality to be much better than other shops in the area. The mint mojito is awesome. The staff is friendly and efficient, but you can also speed things up by ordering via the mobile app."
Philz Coffee,"Rene ALWAYS makes my drink BUSSIN every time, never fails. Rene u the real MVP"
Philz Coffee,"Stale pastry, lukewarm coffee and dessicated, tiny burrito. I ended up throwing out over half the burrito and all the pastry. The mocha coffee with cream was ok but barely lukewarm. The chocolate pastry was at least two days old. The burrito was mostly over microwaved, dry, wrapper and just overall the size of a McDonalds breakfast burrito - and not as fresh or tasty. Just stuffed with potato mainly, with maybe  a third of a thin bacon strip and half a scrambled egg. No vegetables or sauce at all. Had better frozen breakfast burritos from 7-11. Menlo Park was light years better."
Philz Coffee,"Almost 18 different types of black coffee ..  ""Itz the best"" is the best one I've tried .."
Philz Coffee,Worst coffee shop I’ve ever been to.  They could not make a coffee in the 15 minutes I had before a meeting.  To go iced coffee comes in paper cups with no lids or straws so there was no way to bring it without spilling or making a mess.
Philz Coffee,"This coffee shop is well-known for its delectable pastries and beverages. I'm glad I got to try it because it was delicious, particularly considering how incredible and fulfilling they all are. However, the service is excellent, and I really advise you to use it!"
Philz Coffee,"Visiting from Ohio and never heard of Philz. I ordered Silken Splendor, so I could use the restroom. Let me say, I was surprised! It was the best cup of coffee I've ever had. It was amazing, and I had no idea coffee could taste so good! Customer service was great too. Employees were patient and friendly!"
Philz Coffee,"Philz is good coffee, definitely not great coffee. Ordered 20 ounce coffee cost was $5.44, that is a extraordinary price tag for a large coffee. Plus they use brown sugar as a sweetener, brown sugar is definitely going to interfere with the flavor of the coffee because of the molasses in the brown sugar. Would I go back to Philz for coffee? Yes, but the coffee is just way too expensive for what you get."
Philz Coffee,Mojito coffee was weirdly satisfying. It is a must try if you are visiting from Eastcoast.
Philz Coffee,"Wow. What an experience. I came here during a business trip and ended up coming over five times during my three-day stay - and then came back for more on the weekend. The coffee is bar-none with so many amazing flavors, and the staff is super knowledgeable and kind (especially Yumi) - taking the time to walk us through the menu and even let us do a little tasting of their trademark blends. Highly recommend!"
Philz Coffee,"Philz has a reputation an for fabulous coffee which is quite accurate, my favorite being the Silken Splendor (with cream). I love how they make the experience feel so customized. The one downside is that the lines can get pretty long at what appears to be any time of day but it's well worth the wait. Heads up though, their coffee can be incredibly strong."
Philz Coffee,"Good Philz location. The coffee is amazing and some of my favorite in the Bay Area, and just about any drink on their menu is great. This location, however, can be extremely hectic and busy due to, well, its location. Expect huge rushes and wait times in the morning, lunchtime, and in the afternoon. But it's for Philz coffee, so it's worth it."
Philz Coffee,Another great Philz location. During the morning rush they are still surprisingly quick at making coffee.
Philz Coffee,Great coffee and staff but seriously... I’ve had to walk out because of the line here at least 8 times in the last 4 months. It doesn’t matter what time/day it is. I work close by (2 mins) but you can easily spend your entire lunch break here waiting to get a plain cup of coffee. They should come up with a better system... not every has reliable Mobile devices to use the walk up app.
Philz Coffee,"Amazing coffee in a great location with amazing staff. Who could ask for more? Each cup is an individual pour over crafted with care. They ask you if you want cream and brown sugar (delicious), but if you're a true coffee lover, try it black. They have a lot of varieties with amazing flavor profiles."
Philz Coffee,"Star* has better, more predictable quality. It’s sad to see but true. This place was excellent. Unfortunately, something was lost."
Philz Coffee,"One of the worst location to go to, messed up my coffee.  It is understandable that they are busy but there is no point buying a coffee from Philz if it’s going to taste worse than the coffee I make at home."
Philz Coffee,Amazing service and amazing coffee. Much better than your normal coffee chain.
Philz Coffee,"Coffee Only here. No Espresso...but trust them, they know what they are doing. Great local coffee stop in the middle of all the offices and worth the wait."
Philz Coffee,"Excellent Philz location in terms of quality of coffee AND customer service.  I ordered an iced coffee online and even though my order was marked ""complete"" in the app, it wasn't at the pickup counter. After waiting 10 minutes, I got the chance to ask an employee where my drink was. The barista was SO kind and apologetic, he even refunded my entire order and I got my coffee for free just moments later!  The only way I would improve this specific location is more seating, but it's more of a grab-and-go branch for FiDi employees.  As always, Philz coffee is high quality and freshly, cheerfully made. Always a good choice!"
Philz Coffee,"Can’t go wrong with Philz, ordered online and was ready on time. Also sat there and did some work. Wifi was pretty good, could be a little better for video conferencing and stuff but can’t complain too much.  My favorites: Philtered Soul (Hot) Philharmonic (Hot) Iced Rosé Iced Mint Mojito"
Philz Coffee,Amazing coffee. The inside feels a bit disorganized if people don't wait in the right place to order/pay/wait. Good food selection here along with large displays of bagged beans. I recommend the Silken Splendor with a splash of cream.
Philz Coffee,One of the best coffee in SF. The variety of beans they have  is amazing with an awesome quality. Their baristas are very friendly which makes a difference in the experience. You feel your coffee is really individually crafted. Be prepared to wait as the line is long. Just wish they had a smaller size available.
Philz Coffee,"Actually faces Market Street.  (6/15/2019) This is an update to my previous review. The customer service quality has definitely gone down in this location. The last few times I have been here, I have felt like I'm an annoyance to the baristas and am interrupting whatever they have going on behind the bar. Rarely do I get eye contact and the welcomes are perfunctory. Also they seem to be shorter on staff, so things can take a long time. The coffee quality is still good, but I don't look forward to going in anymore.  (Original post, after they first opened). I love this location and Philz coffee in general. It's almost always fast and friendly here, even when the lines get long. Casual and with different music playing every time. You can sit in or take to go as most people do. And since it is at a nice plaza on Market St. there are many tables out front to use on nice weather days.  Make sure to follow the signs so you aren't blocking the way of the regulars who go here and know what they want."
Philz Coffee,I love the coffee but the ordering system is messed up. Mobile orders are always 10+ minutes late during the morning.
Philz Coffee,"I've lived in Ethiopia for 2 yrs drinking locally fresh coffee beans that I roasted daily before every use and Philz absolutely kills it. I have never had such good coffee. It's so smooth, never bitter or sour.  It's unbelievable really! I hope you guys expand a little bit and get some stores in the Midwest."
Philz Coffee,Love the ice mojito coffee & avocado toast. Awesome
Philz Coffee,"Like most people, I come here because not only is the coffee great, but the experience is always positive. My primary reason for heading into Philz is caffeine, but the reason I would travel further to get to Philz than to another spot is definitely THE PEOPLE. Everyone who I've been served by here has been super friendly, happy, positive, and makes me feel like I'm a friend who's dropped by to visit. Making every cup just for you, this location handles a LOT of traffic every day, but manages to do it without feeling hectic or bustling. It's like a Bay Area time warp - the way it used to be all over the greater Bay Area, with people just being laid back and friendly, not worried about everyone else's business, non-judgmental, and chill. I'll be coming back to this location whenever I'm in San Francisco because the experience is consistently pleasant. Hopefully you'll agree!"
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee and vibe to the place, selection of food items could be a bit more creative and I believe I went when an avocado on some sort of bread was being displayed and it looked somewhat unappealing so it might be better to focus on nicer things or done fresh to order. The coffee and the people were fantastic though and I was easily convinced to buy some coffee especially knowing where it came from. Would go again for sure."
Philz Coffee,"I'm sorry. We heard all the rave reviews, but ultimately threw our coffee away. Good gimmick with the brewed in front of you, but neither my wife or I liked the actual coffee. Seems to be an Instagram location, that is frequented by the folk who need other folk to be impressed..."
Philz Coffee,This place reminds me of Seattle coffee and I love it! Ironically my friend who joined me is named Phil. So we got a kick out that! He is a connoisseur. The service quality and atmosphere was great. This place attracts like minded people.
Philz Coffee,"I first was introduced to Philz 5 or 6 years ago and fell in love with pour over. Philz was really my introduction into what a good quality cup of coffee could taste like. Prior to this is was mostly Peets for me.  Since then, my taste buds have matured and I have moved on to other higher quality coffee purveyors, but Philz is still a fine place to go and get a well made cup of joe.  As you get to know coffee and bean quality, you kinda come to understand that Philz beans are solidly middle of the road - not great, but perfectly acceptable in quality. I love their blend flavors and you can still get a bag of freshly roasted beans to take home and brew yourself. Definitely a step above the other larger chains in the world.  Came to the Market St. location around 10am to pick up a quick cup of coffee and I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Staff is friendly and the place is busy, but not too bad considering it's location.  This spot is a little far for me and if I am walking out to grab something i'd probably stop at Blue Bottle first, but if I am in the right mood, Philz hits that spot."
Philz Coffee,"The ordering process is confusing: you first have to queue in order to tell a barista what you want, then go to another line to repeat that same order to the cashier. I don’t see how that’s efficient for the business at all, and more importantly I believe a customer shouldn’t have to repeat their order twice.  Regardless, the mojito coffee was great, and this location in particular has seats by the windows which are bright and comfortable. Great wifi, too!"
Philz Coffee,Love the atmosphere here. You can get your tailored menu from barista dedicated to help you. They will give you suggestions if you cannot decide what to drink. Each cup is handcrafted one cup at a time so it tastes extremely fresh and delicious. Their signature mint mojito is a MUST.
Philz Coffee,"Individually made pour-overs. Always a long line, but you get through relatively quickly. Jeep in mind that it takes 5 mins for your coffee to steep, so it's not a quick stop even with no line. Some of the best tasting coffee you can have"
Philz Coffee,"The atmosphere is very modern with their baristas DJ-ing, so there's always a new rythm. The service was good although it's hard to know when to order since the baristas avoid eye contact or don't speak up. So be alert to know when you're drink is up or when to order. The coffee is amazing and I recommend the classic Mint Mojito. This location gets PACKED! So, it can be difficult to find a spot on a table."
Philz Coffee,"The staff here were very friendly and their coffee is seriously the best coffee I have ever had!! If you like medium roast,  try the ""Silken Spendor"". My boyfriend and I are from Canada and we are kicking ourselves for only buying a one pound bag to bring home (shipping it here costs more than the price of the coffee). I also recommend trying their mint mojito coffee. Enjoy!!"
Philz Coffee,"The drinks aside from coffee are not good, so avoid those.  The selection of allergen friendly food (plant based and gluten free) could use some work.  The vibe is nice and the quality of coffee, high."
Philz Coffee,"really kind staff and interesting take on the coffee menu. I love how you order from the barista and then pay, very intimate. Food is overpriced and the chai was delicious but unfortunately didn't have ginger in it, instead it had fresh mint as many of their drinks do."
Philz Coffee,"Some of the best blends that you'll find in the city without breaking the bank. Philz is the 'other' P-named coffee shop that tends to taste better. They have a selection for every pallette, from light to dark. After you select your coffee, you'll be surprised by the selection of breakfast pastries as well."
Philz Coffee,"Great location, spacious indoors but limited seatings, plenty of outdoor seatings but only for a non windy days. Warm, consistent service. They mostly likely give you the wrong breakfast burrito though (can't seem to tell between the bacon, sausage or green chile when they heat it up)..."
Philz Coffee,"I only got water as I was thirsty from walking. My mother got an iced mocha and said it was meh. She didn't finish it. She also said the workers were rude and dismissive, not friendly in their greetings and interaction. They made her feel like she wasn't welcome. Odd since it was a touristy area. Would not go there again."
Philz Coffee,It's a fairly okay branch. Rather small and not a lot of sitting space indoors. There are more sitting space outside though. Service is fairly quick (well as quick as the barista can go!). They do need to try and keep the common/general areas cleaner though.
Philz Coffee,"I already make it a point not to come to this Philz due to the horrendous wait times, but decided to give it another chance after a year hoping things have improved. They have not. Even on a holiday afternoon when the financial district is essentially dear, they still had an over 15 minute wait for your mediocre cup of swill. It's official, this location is hopeless."
Philz Coffee,I love philz BUT the coffee water here is not nearly as good as say the mission local. Idk maybe with the huge lines they don't let it brew/steep long enough (eg only 3 min). But for $5 ?! Even the replacement cup was weak.  Rude/ indifferent attitude while taking the order and serving made me miss mission local more.
Philz Coffee,"This is one of my go-to places in Fi-Di when I decide to go out for coffee rather than drinking coffee at the office. This location is super convenient since it's on Market St - really easy to get to on foot or by BART/MUNI. It certainly gets busy at times with long lines out the door, but I don't feel like I've ever had to wait for an unreasonable amount of time.  Despite the busy-ness, most of the staff I've talked to are friendly and take some time to chat and/or offer suggestions, which is nice. I don't usually drink sweet coffee but I'm partial to the iced gingersnap coffee here, as well as the mocha tesora (medium blend)."
Philz Coffee,"Serves a large variety of blends of drip coffee. I tired the Mint Mojito Coffee. It was enjoyable, but seemed to be designed for people who  like the idea of drinking coffee, but don't actually enjoy the taste . Seating and tables are available, however it is not a very comfortable environment to work or relax in. The price is too high. I imagine the owners are exploiting their clientele of overpaid, bubble-dwelling, 22-year-old software engineers who have not developed a concept of value (for which I was tempted to give them 4 stars)."
Philz Coffee,"As usual, great coffee and great service.  Limited seating."
Philz Coffee,Philz is a good place to get your caffeine on  Sevetal drink options and tasty treats
Philz Coffee,"After having my first cup of philtered soul many years ago now I decided to quite drinking coffee and instead drink Philz. Knowing that each cup I drink was made for me in the moment is big for me, and also I am sure for the baristas as well. Everyone making coffee (can't say so much for cashiers lol) at every Philz I've been to seems happy to really put their brewing skills to the test. Thanks for all the tasty drinks."
Philz Coffee,"The line here seems to be never ending. I love their mint mojito. It's my favorite coffee drink of all time. They have stations where you can walk up to an order your beverage. Afterwards pay with the cashier. The cat Barista will then notify you when your beverage is ready. I highly recommend this place two visitors who want a good cup of joe. They're coffee making process is also very impressive. They grind beans to order and although it does take a bit of time for your coffee to sift through their process, it's worth the wait. You get a delicious and hot cup of coffee that wasn't rude hours ago."
Philz Coffee,Great coffee. Terrible wait time. Was on my lunch break on couldn't even get my coffee. Wish I hadn't wasted my time or money.
Philz Coffee,"Philz made me a coffee drinker. This location makes me go to other coffee shops. Poorly organized ordering and checkout creates a cluster at the front of the store. Lines out the door indicate it's worth the wait. If you're trying to escape the office for a while, their long lines make a good excuse."
Philz Coffee,One of the best Philz Coffee in SF. But there is always a long line during lunch. Best time to go is after the lunch rush. Everyone who works there is always very nice even with it being so crowded. Great place.
Philz Coffee,"I got a small Jacob's wonderbar with 50% cream and no sugar. I'm a casual coffee drinker and usually stick to plain old lattes, which are pretty lightly flavored, so this was pretty acidic for my tastes. also, it was listed under the ""darker"" roasts, so I was expecting it to be less acidic, but I guess not."
Philz Coffee,"Same quality Philz coffee here, buttoned wait times because of all the guys who work in the Financial district that come here. There's less seating as well, but you do get a lot of outdoor seating."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee selection is great and its custom made for you. You can select the type of roasting - dark, Medium, light and the creamer and the sugar level. They add it all up and it's still hot and foamy."
Philz Coffee,Really delicious coffee and friendly service. There was plenty of seating outside for us - only wish they were open a bit later because we wanted to sit a while longer and enjoy the drink.
Philz Coffee,I love Philz Coffee! The iced mint mojito is my go-to for summer drinks. The location is really nice since it's new. Plenty of seating inside and outside along the front as well.
Philz Coffee,"This couldn't be better. At first skeptical having been to many trendy coffee shops, my daughter treated me to my first Philz.  If you haven't been, each cup is made to order from grinding the beans to adding flavors, cream, and the desired roast of coffee until you satisfy your baristas question, ""...have I made it perfect? ""  Philz has more than 15 different beans all roasted to perfection and described on the wall with colorful and whimsical detail.  In addition to coffee, Philz serves hot chocolate, house specialties and an absolutely perfect mocha.  Take municipal or bart to Montgomery station and you are steps away."
Philz Coffee,Mint mojito iced coffee was nice.
Philz Coffee,"The first time I went to this location I ordered a chai. It was delicious and staff friendly. The second time I brought a friend visiting from out of the country and I was expecting the same quality. The chai I ordered the second time was awful~it was over spiced and lacked balance of flavors. I brought it back, as they said I could if I didn't like it, and the staff was rude and unaccommodating. They remade the chai and it was still bad."
Philz Coffee,"Given its prime location, you have to expect reasonably long lines. But the staff is very friendly and I honestly can't get enough of the Iced Mint Mojito. Philtered Soul is also very good."
Philz Coffee,"Philtered Soul was like my best friend while I was visiting the great, great city of San Francisco. That's the flavor...or type of coffee that really called to me with hazelnut being the big descriptor. It was a very nice touch to have a short paragraph on each type of coffee they serve displayed for everyone to read. I suppose with quirky names, the signs probably save A LOT of questions from customers. I tried a couple of other flavors from my friends' cups, but we all agreed Philtered Soul really spoke to our...soul ;)"
Philz Coffee,"I will admit Philz is becoming an obsession for me and have been actively trying out the coffee flavors. I've been making a point to visit if I am near one. Lucky to experienced this newly opened location 45 mins before it closed today.  Told the friendly barista that I have been actively exploring the coffee menu and my likes and dislikes. He suggested three (Dancing Waters, Silken Splendor and Philtered Soul), but told me he was going to make a Philtered Soul medium cream and sugar because he felt, like himself, that I liked ""smooth tasting"" coffee. He was right - I loved Philtered Soul as I was catching up with an old friend that I haven't seen in a few years. As always, the barista said if I didn't like his recommendation, he would be willing to hand brew something else for me. Love that customer service attentiveness! This location is bright (all windows) and airy. Great view of Market Street. Has SF side-by-side Giants and Golden State Warriors artwork proudly displayed - what's not to love about this place!"
Philz Coffee,Thank you Daniel at One Front St! Prompt service and kudos to sanitizing the iPad every time a customer touches it to pay!! Delish Mint Mojito! 😋 Just how I like it sweet and creamy 🤗 …
Philz Coffee,"Use OrderAhead app and skip the always-long line! Excellent coffee and pastries, now with large instructions sign (pic) for newbies! Coffee $18/lb so try to wait for their occasional sale ($14/lb)."
Philz Coffee,Love that the drinks are made fresh to order. Not a huge fan of the price. I ordered the Mint Mojito coffee...tasted like a menthol cigarette...willing to give the other coffees a try though!
Philz Coffee,"Phil'z happened to have an unofficial soft grand opening of this new location as my partner and I wanted a quick coffee break from a long day. We arrived to a very warm yet empty space since we came right around closing time. Upon attempting to pay for our drinks, the barrister gave them to us on the house! Perhaps due to the early-soft-grand-opening? We were informed the team was still under training and the drinks were complimentary. I ordered Jacob's Wonderbar style my partner ordered the Mint Mojito. Both came out as expected and in a timely fashion. Our compliments to the new team!"
Philz Coffee,"Love how light and creamy the iced Mint Mojito is! The Mocha Tesora and Gingersnap are delicious too! This place is too addicting, and I absolutely need my fix before work a few times a week now."
Philz Coffee,"I asked for coffee with cream and a little sugar.   I got a cafe au lait with vanilla.   It wasn't as good and i didn't appreciate the creative reinterpretation.  Still,  in a metro area that has a surprising lack of good coffee,  I'd be willing to try again,  but this time would be a lot more specific."
Philz Coffee,The barista gave a great introduction and provided recommendations. Seating might be a little tricky. They played a lot of Pharrel and music produced by Pharrel. Can't go wrong there. Almond butter toast was delicious.
Philz Coffee,Excellent coffee and even better service!!!! Wish I had more time in SF to try the different types if coffee. Had the Turkish and the wonderbar. Both delicious. Turkish very different and creative!
Philz Coffee,Yummy coffee as always. There's usually a line outside but it moves pretty fast. Great place to go for a midday break: grab a coffee and relax a bit in the outdoor seating.
Philz Coffee,"Mint mojito was my ritual every time I visit San Francisco. But last time my friend told me to graduate mm and try other kind, and yes, it was good step out to a new world."
Philz Coffee,Very unique styled coffee. Tasted minty and fresh!
Philz Coffee,Love their mint mojito iced coffee!
Philz Coffee,Don't really understand the concept if I'm honest. The coffee was okay but it was pretty weak for my pallette and lacking in depth. I find Blue Bottle to be much better quality.
Philz Coffee,The temperature inside was too high and I couldn’t even bear it until I complete my order. Another issue is about the cashier who has not learned to ask whether the customers want to split or pay together; this causes discomfort for customers.
Philz Coffee,Good coffee. Service was fast and relatively friendly.I love the selection at Philz. This is a convenient location if you're walking on market.
Philz Coffee,Great place to grab a cup of coffee with colleagues or with potential employers. There is usually a line but the baristas are great at moving the line along and getting your coffee or tea to you in a timely manner.
Philz Coffee,"This place has great coffee, a good location right between Montgomery and Embarcadero BART stations, and has tons of outdoor seating. Perfect for meetings!"
Philz Coffee,I love Philz. There's really nothing more to it. This location always seems to be popular though - so beware of lines. Thankfully the service is fantastic and totally makes up for having to wait in line :)
Philz Coffee,"I love Philz coffee. Honestly have never drank anything better, including Jamaican rum! Please try the mint mojito, it is to die for! #philz4lyfe go cats/go blue"
Philz Coffee,I love their coffee - exclusively drip approach rather than expesso that everyone else seems to offer.  Philharmonic is awesome in my opinion
Philz Coffee,"Great staff, great coffee; always a true pleasure to visit any Philz, but Front st. is one of the best! Greatly appreciate the energy!"
Philz Coffee,"The Philzters have certainly poured their hearts into Philtered Soul. This handcrafted  cup of java is true to it's description- a taste of hazelnut, hints of cocoa and syrupy  (with whole milk). Had with freshly toasted plain bagel, this soul-stirring experience kickstarts the day.  All this with personalized service!  A suggestion would be to introduce the following types of coffee preparation methods in addition to drip: handcrafted filter-decoction, french-press carafe as appropriate for the particular coffee bean and roast. Expanding the food accompaniment would add a new dimension to the Philz experience.  'njoy!"
Philz Coffee,Best coffee I’ve ever had!
Philz Coffee,"What can you say about this place that hasn't been said already. It ruined that other coffee place from Seattle pretty hard. First visit here was in January, now I seek it frequently now here in southern California, other places just don't compare. Shout-out to the Philtered Soul. 10/10"
Philz Coffee,"Love the mint coffee. Friendly staff. Sometimes it is way to crowded and I don't have time to wait, but when it's not super busy I love getting coffee from Phillz."
Philz Coffee,"Coffee is always. Do try all coffees at some point. Hot or Cold or Over Ice, all served with a smile. Avocado toast with Eggs is also a good option for breakfast."
Philz Coffee,The coffee is alright. I guess it depends on what you get but it’s drinkable. The cinnamon roll was pretty good. Staff at this location is nice.
Philz Coffee,"Love this coffee shop and its trucks - unique pour over coffee and flavors (mint mojito, for example, is a fun one to bring back to the office). These people know how to make coffee!"
Philz Coffee,Coffee is great but crew is very immature. I got mint leaves in ambrosia blend. Derive could be bit more professional
Philz Coffee,"I thought it was decent. The lines are long, but move quickly during the day. However, I am not a fan of the logistics for paying and ordering. It could be streamlined and made a little clearer."
Philz Coffee,Very friendly staff and a great coffee
Philz Coffee,"Friendly service with good coffee that was relatively quick. Very odd set up though to order on one end of the counter, pay at the other and go all the way back for a pick up right where everyone orders."
Philz Coffee,"Always great coffee. Always Super busy. No parking, but on Market where the Muni transit line F, 9, 38, 6, 21, 5 is available."
Philz Coffee,Philz Coffee stopped taking caviar orders and hasn't introduced an android app. So I'm spending 30 minutes to get a decent cup of coffee. This is ridiculous!
Philz Coffee,The Philz Coffee employees each and everyone were individually pleasing very helpful a pleasant experience the employees were also extremely generous fun and great spirited I will refer all my friends to this pleasurable enjoying fun-loving atmosphere
Philz Coffee,Mint mojito is the best !!!
Philz Coffee,Always has good coffee. If you haven't been here before I'd definitely recommend the mojito it's so good!
Philz Coffee,The coffee here was delicious! Didn't have a ton of indoor seating though - most of the outdoor furniture was already getting packed up.
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee done one cup at a time. The mint mojito coffee drink is well-done, smooth, and perfectly aromatic."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, I stop by at least once per week. Line can be long sometimes, but that's because the coffee is really good 👍🏽 …"
Philz Coffee,Very good hand crafted coffee. I recommend you skip the line and order your drink ahead of time with the mobile app.
Philz Coffee,"Massive new Philz in embarcadero. One of the best coffee chains in the city. My goto is a soo good, Philz way (medium sweet, medium cream). Drinks are made in front of you."
Philz Coffee,This is a very busy location.  The line can back up quite long.  The tables also fill up quickly.  The coffee is always good at Philz though :)
Philz Coffee,Really tasty coffee. This place also has really cool ambiance & decor
Philz Coffee,Wonderful location - friendly barista😊🔥 …

Philz Coffee,"Love their mint mojito, but J wish there was a more detailed explanation of the things they offwr, and types of coffee."
Philz Coffee,Coffee worth the wait (though be smart and order ahead). Hard to get upset about a sweet and creamy mint mojito.

Philz Coffee,"Best coffee I've had in California! So busy in this shop and I absolutely understand why, such great coffee !"

Philz Coffee,"Very knowledgeable attendants, great coffee, and good price. We bought a bag of the ""Special"", $14.00 for a lb."
Philz Coffee,"Philz is great, but unless Phil himself is making my coffee by hand, not worth the wait or price w/ so many options around."
Philz Coffee,"If you haven't, you need to, If you have, then you know how good this coffee is.  The line is worth it Go get some now!!!! I recommend a Philtered Soul...Philz Way"
Philz Coffee,"Highly recommended by a local friend, yet we ordered four different coffee blends and none of us finished drinking it."
Philz Coffee,"Expensive coffee, but the flavors will keep you coming back.  Very flavorful and strong.  Not for coffee amateurs"
Philz Coffee,"My Girl Gabby!! Thanks for my iced Mint Mojito extra extra creamy.. extra extra sweet, just how I like it.. Made with 💘 …"

Philz Coffee,Good mojito coffees. They are CLOSED on the weekend. Don't believe Google.
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee but usual long wait, don't go if you're in a rush!"
Philz Coffee,Been here twice! Staff are very friendly. It's also a very unique coffee shop.
Philz Coffee,"The place was nice and the drinks had a twist from the common coffee shops, but music was too loud.  It's nicely that the place is accessible (♿)."
Philz Coffee,"Always the best coffee no matter which location, but mid Market has a fine plaza."
Philz Coffee,Close to san jose state and usually has a long line during the day. But the ecstatic iced coffee is always worth it.
Philz Coffee,They really hustle here. But waiting in line to place a coffee order and then waiting in line to pay and then waiting for your coffee...seems a little much. STRONG coffee.

Philz Coffee,"The best iced coffee mint mojito in SF! Be sure to order the mojito iced coffee, the taste that can only be found in San Francisco, great"
Philz Coffee,"In 2016, I walked away from the memory of drinking too perfect coffee near San Mateo Station. I liked the drip coffee so much that I ordered light roasted dancing water. Maybe it's because I've been drinking a lot of great coffee, or because Fields Coffee has grown like a franchise, the coffee I ordered this time was too bitter and had a bad aftertaste. I regretted having ordered mojito coffee.."
Philz Coffee,"Phil's Coffee, a San Francisco-style cafe.  Since it is a store in a business district, it is often used by businessmen on weekdays.  The store is clean and faces Market Street, making it easy to visit while sightseeing.  Iced mint mojito is recommended for summer. Tantalizing Turkish is also a delicious coffee with a little cardamom that you drink in the Middle East.  The service is also polite and friendly."
Philz Coffee,"A coffee shop that is more popular than Blue Bottle.  Minto Mojito coffee is the most popular.  It is standard to wait for 1-20 minutes in each store, and there are not enough seats, so it is mainly takeout.  1. Order from the barista first, 2. Pay, and 3 wait to get a drink.  A separate mobile order corner is created. It wasn't there last year, but it's made in the store this year.  Stores are growing rapidly.  For coffee lovers, this is a coffee shop worth trying at least once."
Philz Coffee,"I just heard it without knowing it, but it was better because it was a famous cafe. Above all, it tastes the best! It's better because the barista takes the order and puts it down."
Philz Coffee,Sunday is like a day off. Vaccine card not checked. The mint mojito iced latte is delicious. No avocado toast. The scones were ok. Many nearby office workers visit.
Philz Coffee,"I went without any expectations, but the mint mojito coffee tasted like a mixed coffee. I just drank coffee with Tesoro, but it's thick and good to eat with dessert. So I also ordered a vegan donut, which was a perfect choice. When you order coffee, it is not a machine, but a system where the barista drops it right away and goes to the side to pay."
Philz Coffee,"I don't like mint very much, but since everyone ate it, I wanted to taste it, but it was surprisingly delicious. As others commented, it didn't have a bitter aftertaste of coffee, so I like it."
Philz Coffee,"I was so curious about the harmony between mint and coffee, so I walked quite a bit by referring to Google Maps in Union Square, but the taste is worth the effort.  The mint taste is not as strong as I thought. It is sweet, soft and refreshing. If it's near my house, it's such a charming taste that I want to visit every day.  If you have a chance, I recommend you to go there.  There is also peets coffee with a similar name, but their latte is delicious. To me, it tastes better than Blue Bottle.  For those who like coffee, I recommend going to all three places.^^"
Philz Coffee,"I was really looking forward to the mint mojito and it was as delicious as I expected. The mint mocha sold in Korea lacks the chocolate taste. It has a strong taste of fresh mint leaves. It's good because it doesn't make your mouth feel bad even after drinking coffee. I want to eat it again, but it's a pity that I'm not in Korea. Personally, it's way better than Blue Bottle. Here, 100% drip coffee without a coffee machine You can also choose the beans to your liking. The price is good too. $3.5 small."
Philz Coffee,"As a coffee fanatic, it was a bit too sweet for me. Grind some more mint? It would have been nice if the taste was strong, but it just tasted like a sweet vanilla latte. I think it's good to have a drink once since you're here in San Fran.. The staff are pleasant!"
Philz Coffee,The cold brew is so delicious~ Even the mint latte~~~~
Philz Coffee,It's really good. I thought about whether or not to go far away from the accommodation. It was really good. Mojato Coffee
Philz Coffee,Everything is very nice! Very skilled baristas! Good administrator at the checkout! They gave a good mood for the whole day!!! No wonder there is always a queue here...
Philz Coffee,"This is a cafe that wants to be hip. The line to order and the line to pay are different. The mint mojito is famous, but it's worth a try because it contains lots of fresh mint leaves."
Philz Coffee,Mint mojito iced coffee is really delicious. Moderate sweetness and refreshing feeling of mint match. I would like to see you expand into Japan.
Philz Coffee,Mint Mojito Coffee worth trying at least once
Philz Coffee,"When you drink it, the first taste is “Ah, what is it, it’s just a latte” After 2 seconds, “What is it, it tastes like mint?? 3 seconds later “It tastes like mojito too”"
Philz Coffee,Magnificent. They take 5 minutes to make you an excellent coffee in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere
Philz Coffee,service good. Iced Mint Moji or Pilz Coffee.
Philz Coffee,"I tried mint mojito coffee.  I didn't think it would suit my taste because it was mint, but I felt so clean and refreshing.  When I drink coffee, I feel bland and bland. It seemed that the Philz coffee was getting more and more flavorful.  It was better to have the coffee brewed right in front of you after you ordered.  In Korea, I mainly drank Starbucks coffee. It would be nice to have Philz Coffee in Korea."
Philz Coffee,"My girlfriend is a mint fanatic. Even in Korea, we only drink drinks with mint in them. On the other hand, I don't drink coffee much. (My stomach hurts haha) Anyway, when I was going to the West, my girlfriend gave me a mission to stop by and try this Philz Coffee's 'Mint Mojito Iced Coffee'. Even though I was reluctant to drink coffee when I had a bite, I took a video introducing the cafe on the spot. It's really delicious!!. But the next day I thought more than that moment, so I gave up breakfast at dawn and ran to drink another drink. I can understand people who can't forget this taste in Korea. The taste is very unique, but it has a mild taste like latte or original coffee. Mint means 'Mint Mojito' and it's different from the 'Mint Syrup' we know haha Many (Korean) people will refer to this article, so I wrote it as calmly as possible. The person who ate it the next day said it was life coffee. Anyway, isn't it mukbang for Koreans? If you're in San Fran, be sure to stop by Philz Coffee and try something. Especially mint mojito! BLUE BOTTLE was also good (smell of coffee beans and customer atmosphere), but I didn't know the taste of coffee, so I preferred Phil's Coffee (unique taste and lively barista).  Dahee, I confirmed it haha  * If you have been to Union Square or stayed nearby and are looking for Fields Coffee, please come here. Southwest of the Hilton (City Hall side, Golden Gate Ave, Van Ness Ave) Fields Coffee is tough to get to and from after dark. There are few and scary people on the street, and when Asians pass by, homeless people whistle (maybe because they are wearing LA Dodgers hats) haha There are many financial companies here, so it seems relatively safe. * You order the barista first, and while the barista makes it, you go to the counter and tell the drink you ordered and pay."
Philz Coffee,"It's a famous coffee shop, but I don't know the taste of coffee. There are a lot of people, but the store is small, so you have to take out. There were seats outside, but it was raining so it was useless. Coffee is divided into 3 types (depending on how thick it is): dark, medium, and light. Even though I ordered light, it was stronger than the coffee I drink in Korea. I couldn't sleep thanks Oh, and the mint mojito latte is the most famous here. After drinking my friend's, I can understand why it's famous. delicious."
Philz Coffee,"A system where the barista who heard the order actually makes it. Some customers appoint a barista. A popular store with long lines. Perhaps the secret to its popularity is the interaction between people, which is not possible at other coffee chain stores. There is also a special menu that you can't find anywhere else, such as mint mojito coffee."
Philz Coffee,"After you order, the barista will make a cup of coffee in front of you. We recommend the regular blends, such as Philz's classic Tesora blend, as well as the unusual ones like Mint Mojito Cofee."
Philz Coffee,"Mint Mojito... Ah, I really like it haha"
Philz Coffee,"I went to eat a mint mojito, but it wasn't as tasty as I thought. The ice melted more, so it was edible."
Philz Coffee,"The variety of drinks is sufficient and the flavors are excellent, the place is accessible, cozy and spacious, fresh and the decoration is pleasant; It can improve in terms of the speed of customer service; the prices are regular."
Philz Coffee,"""Premiun"" quality artisan coffee, highly recommended, Wifi in the lounge, closes at 5:00 p.m."
