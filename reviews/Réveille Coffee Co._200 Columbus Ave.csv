Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Stopped by to get a cup of coffee just before they closed. The service was fast, coffee was delicious (multiple plant based milk options). Nice outdoor seating area, will be back to enjoy it."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Incredibly friendly staff greeted us, genuinely happy to see us as we walked in. Coffee was well made and delicious, but the Breakfast Sandwich really stole the show! The combination of flavors and textures, with the  gooey yolk, come together perfectly and have me rethinking how i make breakfast sandwiches at home!  Highly recommend :)"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Very good breakfast and coffee! The breakfast sandwich was awesome! O got it without the aioli but my husband kept it on and it was tasty! My husband got the salted caramel latte and I got the creme Brule. Both were a great drink to sip as we strolled the park
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Mornings tend to have a line up so you may have to wait a little bit but the spicy chai latte is the best! This place is conveniently located right across Golden Gate Park, perfect for coffee walks or baked goods.  Very limited seating on the patio outside so opted for takeout."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"I heard good things about Rise & Grind, and wanted to check out the nearby Golden Gate Park anyway, so I decided to check it out. I’m really glad I did!  R&G has a great selection of unique latte flavors, which is perfect for someone like me. I love sweet coffee drinks. I decided to get the crème brûlée latte. I was not disappointed. It was such a unique flavor, and just the right sweetness for me. They even took a blowtorch to the top of the drink to add a little caramelization.  Definitely check it out (and the park too) if you’re nearby."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"One of my favorite cafes in SF. Their large range of specialty drinks is fantastic; I especially love their mint cold brew and black sesame latte, but you honestly can’t go wrong with anything here. Just wish they would reopen their indoor seating like it used to be prior to the pandemic…it was a go-to place for me to get work done or meet friends for coffee."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Rise & Grind is my local shop and they take care of me! On those mornings when I don’t want to make coffee it’s only a couple block to get a great Americano. Line can get a little long on weekends when it’s nice as there is not much else by the Park. Also Google’s hours continue to be wrong. Open M-F 8 am to 1 pm and S-S 8 am to 3 pm
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Such an awesome coffee shop in all regards!  Everyone working there is so nice, they get to know you and your drink order. There’s a wide drink selection with very cool latte options. it’s located right next to Golden Gate Park / short drive to the beach. You really can’t go wrong, this is a core part of the inner Richmond neighborhood and I always try to stop by for an iced horchata latte before going to the beach / the park. Give them a try, you won’t regret it!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"This coffee shop is a hidden gem. Their espresso drinks are consistently good, and they have a selection of pastries that pair perfectly with the coffee. It's also a great place to relax with friends."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"4.5 stars. The breakfast bunwich was heavenly - rich brioche bread, an egg that was just a touch runny, plus avocado and bacon. Our group had the peanut butter, cookie dough, and black sesame lattes - all were good, but just a tad sweet for my liking. Recommend ordering online on the weekend as the park foot traffic leads to some lines."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"A very nice coffee shop on the outskirts of Golden Gate Park. Very interesting coffee selections at very reasonable prices, with a menu of delicious food to accompany. The Matcha waffle was highly recommended and with good reason. The coffee was reasonably priced, the staff was very attentive and quick, and the entire store was bustling with the warmth a coffee shop should have. The free wifi was also a very big bonus as well.  Tl;Dr: While not a location I'd recommend for brunch, I'd definitely be happy to bring my family and friends here if I wanted to take them out for a coffee. The drinks are galaxies apart from anything a starbucks could make, and the food and service are just icing on a delicious waffle."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"They have a wide selction of lattes but I usually get their  brewed coffee, which is absolutely delicious. The breakfast sandwich is awesome and what I get when I want something that will stay with me through lunch time."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"A decent coffee shop in the suburbs of San Francisco.  Located in a residential area so parking is very tough.  Firemen and police officers just park illegally to get their morning coffee.  I don't remember their creme brulee latte much, but I do remember their avocado toast was good.  Friendly staff, safe neighborhood, seems to bring a lot of locals with their doggies over and overall a good morning stop.  I recommend it!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Cute cafe off the beaten path. Stopped by here for the cold brew which was pretty good.  Staff was slow and not friendly.  They seemed more interested in talking with their coworkers and friends not purchasing anything rather than helping customers. No seats were available on the late morning. Seems like it gets a lot of people working from “home” on their laptops. They need to find a way to move people every couple hours if they want more business.  Only street parking is available...good luck!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Got the Whopper latte, which is a malted milk and chocolate drink. Definitely not as sweet as a Starbucks drink, but not unsweet either. If you don't like super sweet coffee, this is the perfect level of sweet (If you do like sweet, you can order it to be extra sweet). It also had delicious crushed whoppers on top. I just wish that the candies didn't get mixed in with the ice cubes because I can't eat all of them when I finish the drink. I give this drink an 8/10."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Best dirty chai on our 12 day road trip from Portland to Big Sur. Breakfast sandwich also delicious. Cons: No comfortable place to sip inside on a chilly morning.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Delicious breakfast and even better coffee. I got the avocado toast and a cookie butter latte and then walked to Golden Gate Park to enjoy it, 100/10 experience."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Thank you so Much for the review Erin!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,The avocado toast is delicious and well priced! And the London Fog is wonderful.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,It was the nearest coffee shop to the park and I’m glad that I stopped by. Their coffee is good and the place is cute even though there is no seating options.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Been here a few times since moving to the area. Solid coffee for $2.75 you get a pretty decent size cup. Friendly staff. They don't leave all the milk options out so you might have to ask. Pet friendly as well. One of the few places that was open at 8am on New Year's Day which I appreciate.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great breakfast stop with both good food and coffee. Their breakfast sandwich is one of the best in the avenues and their coffee (including lattes) always hit the spot.  A staple of of our morning routine every time we go to the Blue playground in the park.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great coffee and service! Convenient stop on your way into GGP. V good sandwiches as well. They close at 1pm during the week, 3 on the weekend."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Not many seats, but friendly staff and really good coffee! A good place for a hot drink if you’re just entering or leaving Golden Gate Park."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"We go to this place in our last travel and can tell you that is a good site to can take a very good coffee. Can go in afternoon or night to cam take a good lunch, have more differents types of food to adjust to all people.  Really recommended site to go with friends and family. 10/10"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Nice! Tasty! Good prices!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great coffee! They have plenty of plants which adds to the vibe. Only wish they had a little more sitting space to enjoy that great coffee.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,My favourite place to get avocado toast. I don’t even like avocado toast.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"10/10 all around. Coffee and espresso quality, food is soooo good (seriously please try the breakfast sandwich) and the employees are so chill and nice. Seriously, shout out to the 3 employees who worked there today! They were so friendly and clearly love what they do.  Also really love the giant display of plants they have.  Support this business they definitely deserve it"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I have to say the place is cool but I really like the fact that they serve really fast and love how close to work it is. I have to say come over and try the spot out.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Fast and friendly! Coffee is good and their breakfast sandwich has a unique sauce that is delicious. Thank you!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Rise & Grind is my go-to cafe for work and study. It is nice and quiet with chill music that is not loud so I will not be distracted. I love their latte and cappuccino. Sometimes I’ll try their special drinks too. It is located right next to the Golden Gate Park so having some coffee before or after a walk in the park is the most wonderful thing in a sunny day!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"It can get very busy, so be ready to wait. Nice pastries and friendly staff."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Yummy little spot for a simple breakfast and coffee. The ube waffles were a nice surprise, since its usually a pretty uncommon flavor (especially for waffles)."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Delicious breakfast sandwich and a sweet community vibe. No seating inside but a few small tables on the sidewalk out front.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Quite possibly the best #breakfast I've had in a long time. Avocado on toast with 2 poached eggs and some chili flakes. The bread and eggs were perfect. Also get the Earl Grey tea with vanilla syrup - the best tea I've had in America yet, and that means something as I am British - I have had a lot of tea in my time..."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Will be coming here as my go-to breakfast spot from now on! My friend and I came to try out some of their special latte's, and it was amazing. Highly recommend trying their breakfast sandwich! Definitely coming back to try out their other sandwiches in the future."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Wanted to like it but they lie about their hours. Says 5 on google but they close at 3. Guess I’ll take my business elsewhere.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great spot to grab a coffee, and I love their avocado toast! The bread is fantastic. “V” the owner is always warm, friendly and they bring a lot to the neighborhood. The whole team is also super nice, and I’m happy to see long lines in front of their shop, even if it means waiting a little more for my latte!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,You gotta try the chagachino!  unique coffee drinks with friendly staff.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Was really excited to try their coffee but when I arrived around 2 o’clock, they were already closed even tho it says on google they close at 5. Was very disappointed after a long walk"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Google hours are wrong! We’ve been trying to change it ever since the pandemic. Please help us fix it! Our hours are:  Monday-Friday 8am-1pm Saturday Sunday 8am-3pm  Thank you!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"The breakfast sandwich is AWESOME! The roll they use is delicious. It’s rare to find such a mix of generous toppings with great flavors, that’s also easy to eat on the go. Great place to start your day in the park."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Not worth the hype.  Customer service is terrible and not helpful at all.  Parking sucks!!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Got café au lait and an iced latte. Excellent and quick!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Best coffee around! Plus super friendly staff. My dog loves them too, and usually gets his own treat when we visit. Watch out, it's addictive. I am willing to show up to work chronically a little late just to start my day with a rise & grind drink. It can get pretty busy, but the popularity is warranted!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"This gal wearing headphones accidentally cut in line in front of me. I let her know and she gladly got in line. Then when they called out my drink order, the same woman grabbed it and walked away. I caught up to her before she drank any of it. She apologized and we went out separate days.  Honest mistake but don’t take my Rise & Grind, lady. I’m not a morning person."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,People wait outside for 20 minutes and when you are ready to go in and order they tell you today there is no food. Without even a sorry!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Brilliant specialty latte options! The breakfast sandwiches were also fresh and delicious. Highly recommended!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Nice place to grab a drink to walk around in the park with. Matcha was pretty good
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Cute little coffee shop. Barista made my drink extra special! I love how hidden this place is, it adds a special feeling. Will definitely be coming back."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Really good cold brew! Best I've had in a long time. Also had the matcha waffle. Great place for weekend brunch
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,One of my favorite coffee shops in the city! They have unique drinks that always taste amazing.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,i like the suggestion of campus foodservice affiliation for this facility  i think these are a group of ‘coffee pro’ individuals that did sail to oakland
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"This is My favorite coffee shop. Great selection of coffee, my go to is Richmond Chill iced coffee and a breakfast sandwich .  The owners and workers do a great job and you can tell they care about their patrons.  Grab a drink and bite before you hit Golden Gate Park."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Thank you So much ERIC!!!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"We had two good breakfast sandwich, a pastry and two coffees, all good!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Had one of the lattes and avocado toast. Super yummy! Great place to work/study
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Stopped for an iced latte on my way to the park. Place is nice and they have a restroom.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Awesome selection of coffee and speciality drinks - the seasonal drinks are so yummy! My husband and I love getting a morning coffee from here and then going for a walk around Golden Gate Park since it’s so close. Plus, the staff are always so sweet and welcoming!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Best chai latte i have had in a very long time!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"We came here right before we went to the young museum and the Japanese Garden, beautiful spot, loved their special latte we tried the cookie butter latte and black sesame latte and the breakfast sandwich all fantastic!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Awesome spot in every aspect. I’ve been coming here daily for a few weeks and have gotta say everyone working here is really warm and welcoming. The coffee is great and they have some killer “speciality coffee” combinations. Today after eyeing the food on the menu I decided to grab the hot pastrami sandwich and it was perfect/tasty in every way...honestly I was blown away. Can’t wait to work (eat) my way through the remainder of the menu. Keep up the good work y’all!!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Super convenient location to grab a cup of coffee if you’re headed to Golden Gate Park. Their espresso has a mild flavor that blends well in specialty lattes (and they offer a lot of variety!) but fans of strong coffee might be a bit disappointed. Super friendly staff, pretty speedy despite being understaffed for a busy day."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great little find literally outside Golden Gate Park. We had super tasty lunchtime sandwiches and coffees. Would definitely recommend this for lunch.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"I love this place for what it is. They offer a variety of interesting coffee drinks and have lots of non-dairy milks including almond, soy, coconut, and oat milk. It is not a full restaurant and it is not a bakery, so don’t have high hopes for the pastry case, they do however offer a limited selection of original tasty snacks they make in-house like breakfast sandwiches and ube waffles, opt for those. Best part is that they are dog friendly. I love grabbing a cup on my way for a walk in the park with my pup or after a run. The owners are a super delightful young couple and are often there."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Tried the cookie butter iced latte and avo toast. Perfect flavor and presentation. Saw lots of pups while I ate outside. 10/10.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Best coffee shop in the Inner Richmond. I am a fan of their cold brew and the wide latte variety. The breakfast sandwiches and avocado toast are also good eat in or to go breakfast options. Great place to sit and read or work. Staff is great and the artwork and vibe of the decorations are a pleasure. Highly recommended.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,We stopped here after having dinner across the street at Bob's Big Boy. I got a blueberry iced coffee with vanilla and was DELICIOUS (almost like drinking a blueberry muffin). The interior is very cozy as well and reminded me of a cottage. I bought an additional pound of the blueberry roasted coffee to bring home too! Thanks for the great service!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Definitely loved this little coffee shop when I stopped by. It's small, so get here early if you're looking to hunker down to study/get work done. They have some great lattes on the menu like the peanut butter, black sesame, and even a spicy mocha that has a pretty strong kick (warning!). If you like cold brew, go for the mint cold brew on the menu! The avocado toast and cheesy corn toast were also amazing!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"This is my favorite go to spot on the way to the park. The coffees and meals are really, really great. The wonderful staff makes your order to your specific needs. I enjoy the hot red eye with an extra espresso shot and the breakfast brioche for brunch.  (Currently, Rise & Grind is taking to-go orders and supplies hand sanitizer for customers at the door.)"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Was not open at 7 am.  Update: Tried to communicate with the cafe via email but felt like they ghosted me. I was about to order online but their communication is so iffy. I might just visit in person since I don't have confidence that an online order will even get through to them. Maybe I am on some type of blacklist or something.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Hi K, We are so sorry about that. Our hours have been 8-1PM since the start of the pandemic. I am not sure what happened with Google and why it reverted back to the old hours.  But please let us make it up to you. Please email us for a gift card. your next coffee is on us."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,This place is great. The spiced mocha knocked my socks off
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Awesome service, great tasting coffee - can't go wrong with this spot!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"The most amazing matcha latte. Rich and silky with that delicious earthy tone. Took me straight back to Shuzenji! Pastry was flaky and buttery, was better than I could have hoped for at noon on a Saturday. A must try coffee spot!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I go here often and have enjoyed both the hot and cold lattes I've tried so far. Staff is really friendly. Great neighborhood coffee spot!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"I don’t live near by but I’ll drive to this coffee shop from glen park for their richmond chill popsicle and drink!!! It is my absolute favorite. The staff is amazing. Even when I take 5 month hiatus from going over there, the owner always remembers my twins and I."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Love this place so much. I'm always greeted by friendly baristas and that makes the experience great from the beginning. They seem to know most of their customers because they either call them by their names or know what drink to prepare for them. The food is good and my go-to drink is the matcha sesame latte. TRY IT and thank me later!!!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Friendly, with interesting specialty drinks and food (silly flavored lattes, delicious sandwiches, coconut chia pudding).  This is an excellent place to work. They put out a power strip for laptop users, which most shops would neglect or disdain. There's also a counter where you can work while standing, which is very nice when you've had your nose in your computer all day!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Best in business. Best in the Richmond. My wife and I have murdered for less than their breakfast sandwiches and lattes.  But really - this place is great
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Can’t speak to the coffee but we were hungry and ordered almost all the breakfast menu items. The sandwiches were big and had thick bread. Come here if you want to fill up on carbs. Recommend the avo toast
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"No frill friendly neighborhood coffee shop! I'm not from the neighborhood but I always stop by when I'm in the area for a tasty latte. My favorite is their black sesame, so good! They also have some tasty small bites. Drop in and help me say hi to Cori the corgi."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great variety of tea and specialty coffee drinks. Quality stop from the park.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"The coolest coffee shop in my area:) Americano from ""Rise and Grind"" so aroma and creamy ! Workers are friendly and try to the Best from them duties. One of the Our favorite place with my boyfriend to get a coffee and banana strawberry muffin , or banana walnut bread;) Just come inside and you'll see;)"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Nice little spot to enjoy coffee and get breakfast.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"I've been going there for awhile now. It's absolutely amazing! The food is great, the people are nice, and it has wifi. I once stayed there so long that this nice lady gave me a sandwich and a cookie because she thought I was hungry. I was though! :D"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"This place is great! Had a spicy almond milk chai and avocado toast. The avocado toast comes with a soft boiled egg, soooo good. And the spicy chai was delicious. Just the right combination of spicy and sweet! Definitely recommend this place for a quick bite and delicious drink."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I had a coffee here then I went for a run in the park whilst my girlfriend finished her coffee and read here. We met up shortly afterwards. This is a cosy peaceful place. Good coffee. Friendly staff. Nice and close to the park. 5 star.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great and quick service. Nice ambiance as well.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Black sesame latte caught my attention and it turned out really good.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"PLEASE ROTATE YOUR PASTRIES. Went here in the morning and got a danish, against my better judgment. It tasted and looked soo stale, and it was soggy. Whenever I come here (which is a lot), the baked goods look reeeallly tired and not fresh at all. It’s disappointing bc I definitely would get them more often if they just looked less sad. There’s multiple bakeries nearby, what’s the deal???"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Hi Lh, we get our pastries delivered every morning from Panorama Bakery. We have passed the review along to them. Please come again and try our sandwiches!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Maybe came on a barista off day? Matcha latte was topped with thick overheated foam as was a cappuccino. Breakfast sandwich was a typical breakfast sandwich, no more no less."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great coffee shop on the south border of the Inner Richmond. The staff are memorably friendly and it's neat that they prominently feature local art in the shop. The food is good, too!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great Ownership and friendly staff.  Always knows the customers names and never forgets my order.  10,000% improvement of what was in the space before.  Just means I have to wait longer for my coffee... Great spot, free wifi when you ask for password."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Really great breakfast sandwiches and awesome chai. Very close to fulton and 8th, it would be an nice morning spot to hit up before or after your morning walk through the park."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"I tried their Peanut butter latte with Oatmilk. It kicked butt.  I would definitely go for it again. Pro tip, dont let it settle, maybe even give it a stir. My last sip was a bit crunchy"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,So great to finally have a good coffee shop in this part of the neighborhood! Their own biscuit breakfast sandwich is good but they also have baked goods from Devil's Teeth!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great coffee, but quite possibly the worst croissant I’ve ever had. It tasted like it was a few days old, and was oily. Avoid the pastries."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,It's young and hip spot for good food & drink. I like coming here to get some work done and the staff / owners are really nice! It's also really cool that they show local artists work.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Their take on Vietnamese coffee, the Richmond Chill, is delicious! And there's art on the walls for sale that I am personally considering buying. It's a largely stare-at-laptop crowd."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great quick service with a variety of delicious drinks. I got the iced spicy chai and it actually tasted like chai! Great place to grab a quick drink
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Everything here is delicious!!! I love the Creme Brulee Latte and Avocado toast. The staff is super friendly 🤩 …
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Love their avocado toast mainly the reason why I visit this place. Coffee is great and staff are always accommodating. Highly recommended!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Thank you!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Nice little stop for coffee and a light bfast. Loved the bunwich sandwich. Pics on google are misleading - they do not serve waffles anymore.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"love this neighborhood coffee shop! friendly staff, amazing coffee and food and great atmosphere!  a daily must for my morning pick me up!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great little coffee shop near the park. If you're looking for a great stop to sit down for a bit come on through here. The biscoff cookie butter late is wonderful.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,It was best place in  my trip. People are very kind. Coffee was great. Thank you for giving me two pieces of Cookies.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Don’t think I’ll be going back. Cute spot but okay staff — not rude or anything, just standoffish and not my vibe"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Business should update their hours on google to not waste their customers’ time
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Super place. Friendly helpful staff. The avocado toast for breakfast is delightful. Coffee's hot, large and tasty."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Cute place, good for families, studying, and hanging out with friends. No wait this morning! Espresso had a little bite to it, but otherwise it was delicious."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Matcha waffles had great flavor but were too dry. Creme brulee latte was a performance to make!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"They sell a lot of unique, tasty coffees. They have good wifi and tons of outlets. Barista is also really friendly!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great spot for a variety of drinks. Grab a coffee and walk in the park!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Not a very good cold brew. Spicy chai tastes like ginger water and service was even worse. Would not return.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Friendly, cozy spot to grab coffee and a bite. All the baristas are on a first name basis with their regulars. Love the energy of this neighborhood spot."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great group of people and great location right near the de Young and Academy of Science.  I recommend the Richmond chill and the creme brulee latter if you want a dessert coffee
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Service was exceptional! Our coffee was taking a bit longer to make due to a special request and they gave us free banana bread for the wait.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Rise & Grind is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Well made coffee drinks, tasty snacks and friendly staff help make this spot a convenient regular pitstop."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Black sesame latte, breakfast sandwich"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Favorite coffee spot in town. Signature lattes are all delicious.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I asked if my child could use the restroom emergency . Employee stated for customers only . Called me rude for being concerned for my kid peeing on herself. Customers very nice

Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Super nice staff, very friendly, knew their regulars, and kept taking orders even after closing."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great coffee and kind staff! The Crème Brûlée Latte is delicious!

Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I don't often go to cafes but this place is so much more than that. It's a community. Love it here.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,My go-to coffee shop in the Richmond. Can’t miss with the Richmond Chill and Pastrami sandy!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great coffee and food, although the tech douche shouting into his bluetooth earbuds or his Skype session is often found here"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I like their coffee. It's a nice little neighborhood location that is conducive to quiet conversations and studying.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"They are so nice here and they always remember my name.  For that reason, I will sometimes go out of my way to stop in even if I am in a different trajectory to work."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Small little coffee and tea shop right next to the park. Didnt get any food but looked like they had some decent options.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Great service and good drinks. Plenty of seating and a restroom for customers. No baby changing station... lol.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Coffee tasted bitter and burnt, like they need to clean their machine asap. Milk was steamed like one big foam blurb.. ☹️"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,We are so sorry hear that your experience was not pleasant. Can you tell us what drink you ordered and what time you went into the shop. We'll get to the bottom of this right away.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Closes at 1, not 5"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,such nice baristas! Loved the cookie something latte 🤍🤍 …
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Coffee shop itself is OK but coffee is not. Tried this place twice, still didn't like the coffee. It is more expensive too compare to other coffee shops in the neighborhood."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Hi Cynthia,  We are sorry you did not enjoy the coffee. Can you tell us how we can make it better?"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Excellent spicy chai and great variety of fun drinks! Grab one and hang in the park!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Great menu, great coffee and friendly quick service!!  Try the Richmond Chill on a hot day!"

Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,"Nice costumer service, good coffee, but the ambulance is a bit cold and can improve"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Overrated sorry to say..the espresso here is very bland no flavor..
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,Coffee is very good. But paper cups kill the taste of the coffee.

Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,I love this place!  Be sure to try the creme brulee latte!
