Cafe Destijl,Great place.  Enjoyed soup with sandwich.  Very close to exploratorium.
Cafe Destijl,Great coffee and great salad and soup. I've been travelling around the US for weeks and this is one of the best meals I've had. Mine was all gluten free. Very fresh salad. Yum! 😁 …
Cafe Destijl,Amazing fresh food. Staff are wonderful and friendly. Owner is amazing with his knowledge. Super clean. Went with a friend for lunch will definitely go back when I’m in town next.
Cafe Destijl,"My coworkers and I come here for lunch. Amazing sandwiches and salads, great coffee too. The staff is very friendly and service is great. Highly recommended."
Cafe Destijl,"It always takes a long time to get your food here if you don't order ahead. Good food, huge portions, which is unnecessary. Slow but polite service, had to wait for my iced tea til after lunch once."
Cafe Destijl,"agreed, be ready to wait if you come during lunchtime! De Stijl (pronounced De Steel) slow-paced European style cafe. My goto here for lunch is the enchiladas; come with a yummy green salad and your choice of red or verde sauce - dericious!  their breakfast burrito is also pretty good - comes with a fruit salad - just a bit pricey"
Cafe Destijl,"Paid $15 for a cobb salad and walked away with a Caeser- didn't realize soon enough, but definitely not going back!  UPDATE: Received cobb salad and cookie on the house as promised by the owner. Thank you, Cafe Destijl :)"
Cafe Destijl,"Hi Guadalupe, yes we did give you the wrong salad  but by the time we realized it was too late. We were short staffed and things were a bit hectic, please come in tomorrow for lunch and we will make sure you get your cobb salad and a cookie on the house. And I do apologize for this inconvenience, we would love to make it up to you, thanks."
Cafe Destijl,The soup of the day was roasted cauliflower and jalepeno and it was amazing! All the other food was good. The service was pleasant and prompt.
