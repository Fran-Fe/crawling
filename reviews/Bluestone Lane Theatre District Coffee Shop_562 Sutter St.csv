Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"This Bluestone Lane cafe is located inside the same building as the Emblem Hotel. It is accessible through a separate door. The cafe is small with limited opportunity to sit down and drink your coffee there. When the weather permits there is outdoor seating available, but there are only a few tables available, and they are right on the sidewalk of Sutter Street, so it can be noisy. The staff at this Bluestone Lane cafe was very accommodating, knowledgeable, and helpful. We enjoyed being in the cafe and the drinks were delivered quite quickly. We will definitely come back to this cafe."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Hi there - we appreciate your feedback! We are glad that you enjoyed your visit and we would like to see you back soon!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Great avocado toast! My chai latte was better than I expected. It could be more spicy and less sweet. I would say it's a little better than Starbucks, at least, and AFAIK the best option in the Union Square area. They have non dairy milk, including oat."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hey Adam - thanks for the amazing review! We're stoked to hear you enjoyed the avocado toast and chai latte - it's one of our favorites, too!"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Good coffee, of the standard one is accustomed to back in Australia, but pricey - the small 2-shot Piccolo with oatmilk was $6. Starbucks' larger $6 3-shot oat latte is better value but lower on flavour. I brought my keep cup but they used a disposable and transferred it, which defeated the purpose. The tip prompt at the payment station is definitely un-Australian :-)"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Lovely cozy spot. Great service. Good breakfast options and great coffee. Nice airy feel with lots of light.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hi, Richard! Thanks for sharing your positive experience with us. Glad to hear you liked the breakfast options and coffee! See you soon!"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Coffee moca and chai tea were sadly not so great, Fresh brew coffee a block away had Way better taste.  The blueberry muffin was most excellent."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hi there,  Thank you for your valuable feedback. This does not sound like the food quality we strive for and we have passed this on to our management to address. Please email us at greetings@bluestonelane.com so we can invite you back and make this right.  Thank you."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Excellent place to take a breakfast! Crunchy croissant, good capuchino, and excellent avocado toast with Prosciutto Benedict eggs! Beautiful decoration! 100%"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Thanks for being a local, Barbara – we’re so glad you enjoyed our croissant, cappuccino, and avocado toast. We look forward to seeing you soon!"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Lately the food is not as good it was at first. Portions are a lot smaller than they used to be(e.g. rainbow bowl). The place is always full of trash, and it's a little too pricey for the type of service. This morning I had to wait 20 minutes for a latte, had to leave and come back to pick it up. And when I got to the office, I realized it had a white hair sticking on the edge of the cup. What a dissapointment! Money and time wasted."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hey Ian,  We're sorry to hear that your experience at Bluestone Lane was not up to standard. We would love to chat with you further and find a way to make it up to you so that you can enjoy your next visit, on us.

Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,by far the BEST avocado 🥑-Toast I‘ve ever tried before !!! And best Iced dirty chai latte - wow!! 💚 The staff is so friendly and lovely!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Hey Shena - thanks for the review! Glad to hear you enjoyed the avocado toast and the iced chai latte. We'll see you soon - treat yourself!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,In one word — amazing! Great toasts and coffee. Friendly staff. Very clean. Bonus: right next to a hotel that has some great selfie spots.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Olga! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed our coffee and toast menu. We hope to see you again soon!"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"My favorite coffee shop in SF, especially for South Africans reminds me of home."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Hey Zaheera – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"service was fine everyone was nice, however they were one of the only locations in SF i had been rejected the use of cash and had to use my card. with that being said i do not recommend the food or coffee from here, for the coffee tasted watered down and burnt, the avocado toast was alright for the most part but the lemon on it was a bit much (me being a full time chef) and had been unnecessarily served to me in a togo container, meaning they could have used tableware. the person i was with did enjoy their salmon toast, but were equally as unimpressed with the coffee. i had also gotten a small $6 +t fruit cup that had a few moldy raspberries. call me picky but if you ask me youre better off going to starbucks over this place for breakfast."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Great coffee shop with healthy toasts. Loved the oatmilk latte.   Extra seating in the connect hotel was very cozy.  Visited multiple times on our trip!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hey Megan,  We're so glad to hear you have been loving our Sutter St location. We hope to see you back again soon to enjoy some more great coffee and delicious food.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Great cup of black coffee. Not sour like Starbucks, incredibly mellow and smooth. Will definitely come back. Only gave 4 stars cause their machine to order is slow AF"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Hey Andrew – thanks for the review! We can’t wait to see you again. Thanks for being a local!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Best Avocado toast with egg I have had in years! The coffee is on point too.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Thanks for being a local – we’re so glad you enjoyed the Avocado toast with egg. We look forward to seeing you soon!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Came here around 10:45 on a Friday and ordered online and was told our order would be ready at 11:13. Our cold brews came out really quickly (but a dash of oat milk is more like a 1/4 oat milk) - not a huge issue. 1:13 came and went and at about 1:35 we noticed someone who ordered after us grabbed two boxes of food (okay no problem hers came out first). A few minutes later we heard someone saying “this isn’t my order” so we looked and she had two open boxes of food at the counter. They took them and then closed them and called out my name. Those two boxes of food were taken away from the counter/kitchen and opened by a stranger who was unwatched and then returned and given to us. The food should have been remade without question.  The two items were an avocado toast and a salmon toast - neither of which had any resemblance of warm. Seemed like toast that was cooked last night. So we had cold soft toast that had been in a strangers possession - I will never return here.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,We are disappointed to hear about your experience and would like to learn more. Please contact us at greetings@bluestonelane.com so you can provide your full feedback for us to review.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"It was 2019 that I called by on my visit from Australia and it was good to have a coffee ""just like at home"". In normal times, Australian and USA coffee cultures are quite different. Prices expensive by Australian standards but you are talking about the Union Square area of downtown San Francisco."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Cheers, Paul! We're so happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and our coffee."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Very delicious! Good price for what you get  I am gonna come back!

Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hi Stefan,  Thanks so much for stopping by! We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your time at our Sutter St location. We hope to see you back again soon.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Nice atmosphere. I had an almond milk latte and a raspberry croissant. The croissant was delicious and a good size. It had a lot of filling and I was happy with it. For the latte, I thought the portion size was a bit small but I guess it is San Francisco. There’s not too many choices around here so I thought I filled a good void."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hi Michael,  We love to hear you have been enjoying our Sutter Street location and everything it has to offer. We hope to see you in again soon for some more great coffee and a croissant.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Ordered delivery order. 5 total items. Forgot two. Didn’t provide straws for cups that require straws.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hello Jacob,   We apologize for this inconvenience and have passed on your feedback to management. Reach out to us at greetings@bluestonelane.com so we can have you back for a coffee and make things right.  Thank you."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Another overpriced sf coffee house. They get extra stars for the great muffins but lose a couple for the price and snooty service.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"The food and drinks are so delicious here. The smoothies are absolutely amazing! We enjoyed the oatmeal, iced mocha latte, peanut butter toast and berries with mint. Highly recommend!"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Thanks so much for the review, Jackie! We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again soon."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Good coffee and delicious avocado toast. It's inside a hotel.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"If you need a nice quick coffee to go in the Union Square area that isn't starbucks, this is a great option! Recommend to avoid or come back later if it's filled with groupings of hotel guests checking in or out.  Newly (re?)opened. Good 3rd wave coffee methodology. They're definitely a 3rd wave chain as opposed to a nice specialty sit-down cafe. Lots of union square area in and out traffic, as well as people heading out of the hotel, so may be crowded with suitcases. Very small, not really a sit-down place. Two days in a row, same order (espresso macchiato), same barista, same coffee, quality varied wildly. The first day I was one of two people in there and it was delicious - the second day there were a few groups in there checking out of the hotel, and I got served a very sour very burnt old cloves tasting espresso - NOT macchiato like I ordered. I was fine with the order mix up because I got charged for an espresso and I'll drink an espresso now and then, but once I tasted how bad it was it was a let-down. I actually had to leave it, I couldn't finish it. Sugar and milk only accentuated the bad flavors in it."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hi There,  We are so glad you enjoyed your first experience at our Sutter Street location. We do apologize for the mix up and will use this review to work on making our Sutter Street location a better overall experience for our locals. Thank you for detailing your experience and we hope to see you back at one of our locations very soon to give our coffee another try.  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,My go to coffee shop. Extremely friendly staff and great coffee!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"A tiny place - but it shares a space with the hotel next door, which is a great place to plug in and get some work done.  Love the gluten-free avocado toast with poached egg and the cold brew coffee."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Hi Kim,  We love to hear your go to is a gluten free avocado toast and a cold brew... oh and don't forget the egg! We hope to see you back again soon to enjoy another one of your favorites!  Cheers, The Bluestone Lane Team"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,Small portions and overpriced.  Oatmeal was unimaginative.  Coffee was good and staff were friendly
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,"Visited this place once in Oct 2021. There was sullen, not friendly barista who ""forgot"" part of my order claiming my fault. Man does not like his job and guests feel that."
