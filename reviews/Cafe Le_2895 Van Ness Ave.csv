Cafe Le,"We have travelled to San Francisco many times and we have visited various restaurants and cafe's until we discovered Cafe Le on this trip.  We loved it so much that we were there every day for breakfast.  Simple food; delicious sandwiches, humble and friendly staff. If you are looking for a simple no-frills cafe with mouth-watering sandwiches, Cafe Le is the place.  Just amazing!  I would rate it 10⭐️"
Cafe Le,"Best mom and pop breakfast place of our San Francisco vacation. Humble but delicious breakfast sandwiches. A pretty good menu and coffee options for such a small place. No frills, but everything you could want for breakfast."
Cafe Le,"Extra fresh sandwich, nice hot chocolate and nice ladies. Be careful if you plan to sit as they only have 5 tables. Most people take their breakfast on the go.  Had the turkey cranberry sandwich."
Cafe Le,"The people who run it are nice and local people seem to have a very positive relationship with the place. I had coffee which was not so great, and to be fair we only visited because we needed to use the bathroom. It wasn't that inviting otherwise."
Cafe Le,"The best place for breakfast you can choose in San Francisco. Amazing ladies, great sandwiches and breakfast #6 top of the top:)"

Cafe Le,Got the #7 and really enjoyed the sandwich. The coffee was really good too. Make sure to stop in if you want a quick bite to eat and to start your day off right.
Cafe Le,"Awesome breakfast sandwich! The owner gets a little worked up if you leave without paying, but he seemed understanding that I forgot. Seriously, the breakfast sandwich is so good. They have lots of other sandwiches, too. And they have tons of delicious bread, all very fresh."
Cafe Le,"Stopped into Cafe Le for breakfast this morning, and I'm glad we did. Friendly, cheerful staff within a compact and bijou cafe. Breakfasts are nicely cooked. We had a sesame bagel with egg and sausage, and toast also with egg and sausage. Fresh orange juice and coffee sorted us out nicely. The menu suggested they also do nice sandwiches and a few cooked meals for lunches. Would go back."

Cafe Le,"I started my morning near Fort Mason looking for breakfast and finding a coffee shop open early, only to see a VERY long line. I Googled around for nearby options and found this wonderful little café!  Super small space, just one sweet lady seemingly in charge of the whole process, making every order fresh. Very affordable, a bit of a secret it seems given that it wasn't busy. Absolutely DELICOUSL breakfast sandwich, you can't beat a fresh made sandwich made with love like that."

Cafe Le,"My experience in this place was very good. We had had breakfast in various places for several days but we loved this place since the breakfasts are very similar to those we have in Puerto Rico. They have a variety of breads, hams and combinations. We all liked the coffee. The ham was different but it was very good. Breakfast was served quickly and everything was very good. We had breakfast in this place the 3 days we were in San Francisco. In short, a place with good breakfasts and excellent service. I recommend it."
