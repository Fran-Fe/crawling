Mercury Cafe,I come here very regularly and they have a few vegan options - avocado toast and oat milk lattes. I wish they had a few more vegan and gluten free options like scones but what they do have is great!
Mercury Cafe,"I would give this place 6 stars if it were possible. This place is the quintessential neighborhood cafe with an overdose of feel good from the decor, the location, the interiors, well curated books and just random snippets of wisdom scattered heartily all over the cafe! I got their blueberry lemon scone along with coffee. But I could see people around me savoring the huge sandwiches these guys specialize in. A must visit in SF ☺️"
Mercury Cafe,"My recent experience was disappointing/a waste of time and money. Pros are the sunlit location & peaceful atmosphere, plus they have a charming, soft spoken girl up front that is probably just trying her best. But, that can’t remedy the experience as I am sure there are other places with just as sunny a vibe and a way better food/drink experience.  I went around 1pm for coffee and a sandwich. The inside seating was pretty full.  I waited 30 minutes for my sandwich, (seeing it was busy, I didn’t complain, but I definitely observed people who got there after me receive their dishes before I did. I don’t understand their service system and think they may have just forgotten). I got my latte relatively soon, but it was too sweet for my liking.  When I finally received my Turkey sandwich, it was inedible (literally drenched in chipotle sauce, you can see how much I scraped off the bread in the picture below). I ended up forcing myself to eat half of it and leaving the remainder for the trash.  A waste of $30. I will find another café for my Saturday outings."
Mercury Cafe,Hi Joline. I am sorry about this experience. I have shared your complaint with the entire staff. I have issued you a refund which you should see on your next credit card statement. 
Mercury Cafe,"So cute and cozy. Lots of books scattered throughout the place to read and great art. They have a piano for the occasional jazz night. Delicious pour over. Really tasty sandwiches with fresh bread. Overall, a really tasteful and tasty place to visit!"
Mercury Cafe,"Loved the latte, the avocado toast and the patio. Friendly fast service!"
Mercury Cafe,"Updated review: this place is awesome. The coffee, the food, the staff, the music, the light, the ambiance. The first time I came here I had a bad experience, which I kept below, but I’ve only had good visits since.  It’s very low key, with lots of light and laid back vibes. This place stands above any of the other super-boutique coffee shops in the area by being unpretentious and easy going. Ignore my old review, try this place out .  That said, no gluten free options, which stinks, but whatever. I love this place too much to knock it a star for that. ——  Early 2022:  $5 for a small cold brew, $8 for granola, and a 45 minute wait. Showed up around 11am on a Sunday to grab a quick bite - ordered above items, and sat down. Got my coffee - very heavy on the ice… - in a minute, then me and my two friends proceeded to wait about 44 minutes for our orders. There were three of us, if that helps paint you a picture.  After about 30 minutes I went in to ask about our food and was asked to be patient - fair enough, places are busy - would have preferred a “there’s two people ahead of you”.  Another 10 minutes and someone comes out to ask us what we ordered. We tell them, get it in 5 more minutes or so, and eat it with anger.  Great vibes for a coffee shop - I’d love to come here to get coffee and work, and I’m sure my experience was an outlier, but I had a very annoying experience getting food - and there are enough coffee shops I don’t need to try this one again."
Mercury Cafe,"Hour long wait for breakfast and the food was average at best for the price. Rude waiter and place also infested with flies  Edit after reply: they refunded 1/5 members, so they get 1/5 stars"
Mercury Cafe,"We are sorry for your experience. Sometimes when a small place such as ours gets very busy very fast, we cannot fulfill orders as fast as we'd like. We are not McDonalds. We don't try to be. And our pricing is based on costs for organic products and an ever-increasing wage, as we believe those who work in San Francisco should be able to afford living in San Francisco. Btw, didn't we refund the money you spent on the food? "
Mercury Cafe,"It's a cool place to drink coffe. I got a moka and my friend got a chai latte. Both were pretty good. Also, we got an apple pie. We didn't wanna take breakfast, but the dishes look nice."
Mercury Cafe,"Great vibe! Vanilla latte was good too, just didn’t have any art. The blueberry muffin was kinda mid. Overall would go again!"
Mercury Cafe,Blueberry muffin was great. Coffee average strength. A little pricey. Overall good.
Mercury Cafe,I was in San Francisco from England and I met up with a friend at this place and it was wonderful lovely food and great service. Highly recommended
Mercury Cafe,Cozy and chill. All staff are friendly! Highly recommend it. But the wifi is a little bit slow
Mercury Cafe,"I finally got to have coffee here! I’ve been walking by before work in the mornings 7.30-8am and they are definitely not open then, I thought it was perhaps closed down but I’m happy it isn’t and that I could finally have an Americano before my departure! The location is perfect, the vibe is very Sunday Coworking + Coffee so fairly quiet, no noisy Yoga Brunch girls 🙏"
Mercury Cafe,"Mercury Cafe is the best place in the world to nurse a hangover. It is bright with detoxifying sunlight. The coffee is muddy, just like your mind. The atmosphere is studious and the silence lets you focus on a redemption path. The crumpets and the thick egg yolk, doused in Tapatio are ingested to do their magic from within your gut, cleansing your sins. Within a few hours, you can be a new person, and start to find ways to help others."
Mercury Cafe,AMAZING scones.  Delicious coffee.  Very relaxed place.  It was a nice place to collect your thoughts.  Nice staff.  I enjoyed taking my time and drinking my coffee.  I took a scone to go and it was delicious even 2 days later!
Mercury Cafe,"Amazing service, delicious food and really great tasting coffee. Really cool atmosphere as well, nice spot to hang for some time."
Mercury Cafe,amazing place. delicious pie and other baked goods. lively and delightful people.
Mercury Cafe,"Great little cafe. Friendly staff, has a lovely welcoming vibe. Coffees good. Chai latte is good. Not an Aussie chai latte brewed on real tea, but a good version of. Nice home cooked cakes. We walked 20 mins each morning from our hotel to get a good drink in a lovely welcoming atmosphere."
Mercury Cafe,My go to Cafe for Hayes Valley their scones & 🥑 toast are scrumptious!
Mercury Cafe,"Good food, but the servers rarely make eye contact and gave me all my dine-in food in disposable containers. I found these things a little rude."
Mercury Cafe,Quick stop by to grab a latte before jumping on the 101. Really friendly barista and they have a restroom. They have almond or soy milk for extra change and plentiful menu for a cafe.
Mercury Cafe,"The service is nice, and the atmosphere is chill, but if your laptop running low on battery, don't bother staying for too long: they frown on their patrons using the cafe's outlets. They weren't rude about it, but it's not the best place to recharge anything but your body's energy level."
Mercury Cafe,This was a bit over priced for what was delivered. Coffee was a bit stale and tasteless.
Mercury Cafe,Great breakfast and this is the place where you want to be after you wake up
Mercury Cafe,Staff was kind of rude and the coffee was average. Wanted to love this place but other coffee shops in Hayes provide a much more friendly experience
Mercury Cafe,"Lovely place, great atmosphere, am a solid jazz performance on a Friday night. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town!"
Mercury Cafe,"Awesome sandwich, great service & exceptional looking scones — definitely repeating this great spot next time I’m near!"
Mercury Cafe,Friendly staff. Good breakfast food. The biscuits are especially nice.
Mercury Cafe,"Attendant was unfriendly at best (complete lack of greeting or politeness, not answering to a ""thank you""). Waiting for a sandwich for a while, when I went checking she hadn't even started and was texting. No power outlet that I could find either."
Mercury Cafe,Good place to do some work done and siteseeing Coffee was good
Mercury Cafe,"Relaxed Saturday afternoon, not loud. Ate outside. Inside is spacious, natural light brightness. Had a scone & coffee. I didn't think the scone was far out as many others have reported. Next time, I'll try something else. Although café is on Octavia st., it is on the quiet residential side of street. A mini-park is half a block away- a nice quiet stroll ir a seat with nature is an option."
Mercury Cafe,Loved the French Press coffee and atmosphere. Perfect place for me to get a little work done while visiting SF for a conference.
Mercury Cafe,Amazing local cafe in Hayes Valley! They have delicious fresh made scones and a large choice of drinks and breakfast food. It's one of my favourite local business so make sure to stop by and support!
Mercury Cafe,"Great coffee and food, wifi, and natural light. Great place to work or catch up with a friend.  EDIT: food and coffee are always good but they are perennially understaffed and any food order (even a toasted bagel) will always take at least 20 minutes to half an hour to come out. I live around the corner and would come here regularly if this were better. Just can’t afford to waste half an hour for someone to toast a bagel."
Mercury Cafe,"One of my favorite coffee shops in SF! Their country-style baked goods are to die for (especially the pie and the biscuits) and their sandwiches and espresso drinks are top-notch. I believe the owner sources all of his ingredients from local farms.  This is the type of local watering hole I wish we had more of in San Francisco. It's a sunny, relaxed environment and the staff seem to know the whole neighborhood.  A welcome break from the overpriced, yuppie chains that seem to be popping up all over the city :)"
Mercury Cafe,Great small place with lots of good drinks and food.  The scone and tea was just what I needed on the rainy winter day I had it on.  Tea was very hot and scone was not over sweet.  Bathroom was nice and clean however I was their first thing in the morning. Couldn't ask for a better place.
Mercury Cafe,"A good place to sit if you need to be on your laptop for a while, (and everyone in here seems to be.) They also have a really nice outdoor parklet. The food however is not very good. The yogurt granola was really stale. The turkey sandwich was ok but nothing special. The prices are pretty high ($12 for a sandwich) for sub-par food."
Mercury Cafe,"Cute location, okay coffee & NO REFILLS. I paid 3.50 for a black coffee and cannot get one warm up? This is a joke."
Mercury Cafe,Tasty food. Good coffee. Friendly staff. Feels a bit like San Francisco in the 90s. What else could you want?
Mercury Cafe,"The waitress didn't seem very interested in any guests arriving.. Also, during winter for some reason the door is left open and the only way to sit inside is with a thick jacket. Obviously guest comfort is not a priority."
Mercury Cafe,"I live right in the neighborhood of this place and let me assure you      I will NEVER have another cup of coffee there again. Not at their prices. This is one of those places where they micro-brew your  own cup. You get exactly one cup. 8 oz of coffee for $2.50 And no free refills here. So by the time my Egg and Muffin showed up I was finished with my coffee just after taking 3 good sips out of it. I couldn't believe how small the cup actually was. When I brought my plate and cup inside I casually expressed my thought concerning the cup size. All I said to the guy that was working there was that  although the coffee was good I felt that 8 oz for $2.50 without a refill was a little steep. I was then told..""Well to tell you the truth I wish you hadn't even come in""  I   couldn't believe what I was hearing coming out of this guy's mouth. If I were in his shoes and somebody was dissatisfied I would have given the customer a free refill and then shut up. This man's behavior was offensive and rude. What ever happened to the saying  the Customer is always right?"
Mercury Cafe,"Great cafe! It's nice and sunny inside due to the large windows, and they have a really cool old wooden door. They have free wi-fi too! The Eggs McMercury are only served on the weekends but they are very good! There is limited seating upstairs but a decent amount of seating available downstairs."
Mercury Cafe,It's out of the way places that help give San Francisco its charm. The McMercury sandwich was great. They bake all their breads and biscuits fresh daily. Friendly people.
Mercury Cafe,"They have plenty electricity outlet. It is by the street, so not too bad. It is not that classy. Tables are OK Sandwich was OK. Not bad wifi was slow The girl who served me did not offer good customer service. This took off 1 stars. I took 1 points off for wifi."
Mercury Cafe,"Really nice people, and a lively warm space.  But they charged $5.50 for toast and jam...but the toast was cold and the butter and jam came on the side. Totally fine for $1 or $2 toast, but not $5.50."
Mercury Cafe,"Cute, quirky, and casual with fresh-baked goods. I’ve had a couple poor experiences here in the past, but every time I’ve been here recently has been perfect."
Mercury Cafe,Reading cute café with a great patio
Mercury Cafe,"A great alternative to the also delicious blue bottle. Their homemade scones are phenomenal, and they have a great selection of microbrews on tap if you'd like to do some casual drinking outside of a bar."
Mercury Cafe,"Unpretentious, unassuming neighborhood cafe. Great for book-reading, light-laptopping, and friend-meeting. In fact, it's my default rendezvous meeting point for Hayes valley, because it's just a great place to hang out while you wait for your group to assemble."
Mercury Cafe,"This is the first cafe I started camping out at when I moved to SF a few years back.  They have huge floor to ceiling windows that let in a lot of natural light, plenty of power outlets for laptops and absolutely amazing food and coffee.  I'm a huge fan of their vegetarian chili - it's very filling but won't put you to sleep."
Mercury Cafe,"Great cafe. Really personable staff. The owner is there most days working his butt off. Baked goods are fresh, coffee drinks really good without being pretentious."
Mercury Cafe,"good place to spend an afternoon working: power, wifi, and coffee are good and unpretentious. the young lady who makes the sandwiches seems to always be upset about something or other and takes it out on the food. but don't let that get to you!"
Mercury Cafe,Friendly staff and very nice vibe for getting work done. Their latte is well made too.
Mercury Cafe,"The sandwiches here are out of this world— fresh ingredients, homemade bread, and a delicious combination of flavors!"
Mercury Cafe,"Lovely cafe, full of early morning light. Good coffee, yummy strawberry scone and a very friendly lady behind the bar. What a great start to my day."
Mercury Cafe,"Great spot, comfortable and hip. Pretty amazing espresso, even better sandwiches. The owner Nick makes THE BEST pies, definitely come try one."
Mercury Cafe,"Great coffee, food and live Jazz on Wednesday evenings. The hours on Google is wrong, they stay open until 9pm, at least on Wednesdays."
Mercury Cafe,Great place for breakfast or lunch. Good place to work on your laptop.  Some Fridays (especially in summer) they open until 9pm with talks or live music.
Mercury Cafe,Delicious avocado toast and iced chai lattes! Sit by a window or outside on a nice day. Plenty of seating so also a good space to work for a couple hours. Very laid back vibe.
Mercury Cafe,"Never come here on weekends. You can hardly find a seat. Moreover, after 55 mins of waiting of getting a cup of latte, the barista will tell you that just take the cappuccino he made because he doesn’t have enough colleagues to help him."
Mercury Cafe,"Hi. We are sorry about this. Because that's not ever supposed to happen, either the wait or the lousy substitution. The seating is because of the internet. We're dealing with both issues."
Mercury Cafe,"Got a couple of lemonades in a hot day... $4.50 per lemonade for a cup full of ice and little lemonade, what's worst is that they didn't have enough for the ""full"" second cup so they took from the first cup and poured it into the other cup and added more ice. Rip off! Never will I never visit again."
Mercury Cafe,"Coffee was great and the perfect temp, inside is lovely and they have indoor seating avail. Can't recommend enough"
Mercury Cafe,"Only 2 employees working on Sunday afternoon. Served one hour after ordering. Sandwiches were delicious, just budget your time accordingly!"
Mercury Cafe,"This spot gets a lot of light, has comfortable chairs and tables big enough to spread work out on, and very friendly staff. The chipotle turkey sandwich was excellent."
Mercury Cafe,"Land of laptops, steady auto din from Octavia, and a humble menu of soups and salads. My iced coffee and turkey sandwich were both legit, and the staff was peachy."
Mercury Cafe,Had the breakfast biscuit. It was delicious. My friend really enjoyed his mocha as well.
Mercury Cafe,The scones here are amazing. Fresh and hot out of the oven! Plus a friendly staff.
Mercury Cafe,Excellent local cafe. The ambience is modern yet unpretentious. Ordered an avocado toast and black coffee and enjoyed both.
Mercury Cafe,The food was really disappointing and the service was extremely slow as well. Would not come back
Mercury Cafe,"Good neighborhood coffee shop. Tasty De La Paz coffee brewed by the cup, a small menu of decent sandwiches, and friendly service."
Mercury Cafe,The one dude was the hardest working barista I’ve ever seen in my life. It was awesome.
Mercury Cafe,"Cool place, good service, and tasty coffee for a really reasonable price!"
Mercury Cafe,Thoughtfully sourced food including organic hardboiled eggs and the best scone I have ever experienced. Plenty of windows providing natural light.
Mercury Cafe,"The greatest bacon, egg, cheese, and avocado croissant sandwiches in town! I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Mercury Cafe,Best biscuits in town! Don’t miss out on their weekend brunch. Better get there early before the biscuits inevitably run out.
Mercury Cafe,"I’ve never been much of a coffee drinker, but Mercury Cafe has these really good sea salt chocolate chip cookies - and if you get a coffee, add some cinnamon, and then dip the cookie in the coffee, it becomes meth"
Mercury Cafe,Great vibes......solid sandwich.....good coffee
Mercury Cafe,Been coming here regularly for a couple years now. Nick and the whole crew are awesome and the eggs McMercury are my preferred start to the day
Mercury Cafe,"I got the Egg McMercury, sipped coffee, and watched the insanity of SF traffic. But the environment was chill, it removed itself from the commotion outside, and just calmly started my morning."
Mercury Cafe,"Great atmosphere, good food (sandwiches, toasts, soups), great coffee - all you need to spend a couple hours with your computer or meet with friends."
Mercury Cafe,"Cute and quiet cafe near Market and Hayes Valley. Wi-fi and plugs available, with a small cafe menu available. Seems like an okay place to work if you like it a lil calmer."
Mercury Cafe,Down to earth like good
Mercury Cafe,"I was walking nearby and suddenly heard great music. Loads of people, stayed and danced for a couple of hours."
Mercury Cafe,The McMercury is my favorite breakfast in SF. 2 Biscuits with tomato and poached eggs for about $8? Done.
Mercury Cafe,Lots of options and a great spot for lunch.
Mercury Cafe,I can see if you're a remote worker you will like it here. Its quiet. Its not trendy deco but the space good get work done.
Mercury Cafe,"Mercury Cafe is the place to be if you need a chill place to work with amazing coffee, delicious food and the best place to work, you got free wifi plugs and since its a really local spot not a lot of people know about it"
Mercury Cafe,"Quick lunch, very tasty. Friendly staff."
Mercury Cafe,"Actually feels like a local Cafe. Good coffee, excellent in house pastries, lovely way to spend the morning."
Mercury Cafe,Terrible service that is rude and slow. Avocado toast was literally cold bread with the slightest amount of avocado on it. Go anywhere else but here.
Mercury Cafe,Really relaxed community cafe. One of the few around SF where you get great specialty coffee and get to speak to the owner.

Mercury Cafe,"I ordered Mercury Eggs and Lemonade Muffins. Eggs are sliced avocados and half-boiled eggs are really a waste of money The cheese melts on the bread and the bread is hard and bad Lemonade is not too much and expensive compared to the price. I like the muffins the best I think it's scones inside strawberry blueberry It was delicious just typical san francisco If you want to experience brunch, go there. But that brunch is at my house You can make better than that every day you don't have to feel it"
