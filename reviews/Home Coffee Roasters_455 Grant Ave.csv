Home Coffee Roasters,"Home was the perfect spot to pick up a delicious latte and avocado toast while in town for the weekend. Our entire group went here and all 5 of us were very happy with what we got. The avocado toasts were great, definitely throw the fried egg on top. The holy cow latte was very good. Overall very satisfied with everything Home had to offer."
Home Coffee Roasters,I cannot recommend this place more highly. I stumbled upon this coffee shop during the pandemic and ever since I’ve been a regular customer. You really cannot go wrong with any of the items on the menu. I wanted to try something new and the Barista was so helpful in recommending me the Coconut Vanilla Latte which has become my new favorite. Also the latte art is always insanely beautiful. If you’re ever around the Finical District/Chinatown you have to check out Home Coffee. One of the best coffee shops in SF!
Home Coffee Roasters,"A lovely coffee shop that’s super close to Chinatown. Plenty of seating options to get some work done, read a book, or catch up with a friend. The prices are a bit steep (over $11 for a small latte and croissant), hence the 4 stars, but the quantity was generous and the quality of the coffee was wonderful."
Home Coffee Roasters,Super friendly little shop. Had a pour over (Ethiopian beans) and a toast. Both excelent. Kimchi and avocado harmonize perfectly on the sourdough toast with egg. A must try if you like kimchi! Absolutely great.
Home Coffee Roasters,I really like the place. Especially beverages are great. All coffee but different flavours and beautiful art. They make coffee right on the spot. Pretty and nice. Recommend. Btw coffee was so I didn’t have chance to take a picture
Home Coffee Roasters,"I found Home looking up best coffee in SF before my vacation. So I was delighted to finally come in person after following on Instagram for months. I started with the birthday cake latte which comes with rainbow latte art. It was a delicious, not overly sweet vanilla latte with gorgeous latte art.  Before leaving I wanted to try another drink since I knew I wouldn’t be back. I ordered the Cookie Monster latte and asked the barista if they do a cute animal and cookies like on Instagram. She said she’d make me something cute and she didn’t disappoint!!!  Service and products are delicious. Ambiance to this particular cafe is boring and uninviting. Little to no artwork and an industrial style with odd seating arrangements. This would be best to take on the go."
Home Coffee Roasters,Cute coffee shop in Chinatown that does lovely latte art. This place gets very busy with line ups out the door. I ordered a birthday cake latte which was beautifully decorated with latte art.
Home Coffee Roasters,"OMG, the birthday cake latte was the absolute best. I had this 9 days shy of my birthday, so I considered this my birthday coffee. ;) The churro mochi muffin was a little dry, so thank god for this delicious coffee to help go with the muffin.  I am so glad I tried this place before heading out of San Francisco."
Home Coffee Roasters,What a cute coffee shop! Came after a Barry’s class and got the Cookie Monster latte.  Good: - Unique lattes that just look aesthetic and cute - Cute inside area and nice friendly staff - Quick service and great to catch up with friends  Bad: - Not many chairs and the place isn’t super big  Overall loved the drinks and the vibe and would come back!
Home Coffee Roasters,"This is a hidden gem in SF for all those coffee lovers who are bored of the generic coffee shops all over the place. They have a variety of lattes. If you're a chocolate lover, you must try the Red velvet latte... The staff is very friendly and the ambience is great. You'd feel like you've entered a different world in the busy streets of San Francisco."
Home Coffee Roasters,"I’m normally a black coffee person, which I did have here and was also good, but the lattes here are actually amazing! Everyone who works here was great every day that I came in. They do beautiful latte art, the lattes are flavored a touch but not overly sweet, I tried a few of them and they were all amazing. The red velvet might have been my favorite, the birthday cake was also really good (vanilla with rainbow colors and sprinkles!)"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Definitely a chain in SF, but it feels like a specialty coffee place. The latte art is incredible here and the service is always good and there’s free self serve water. The Wi-Fi is strong and lots of people work there and there’s a huge table for people to work off and then there are nooks to sit in that make the place feel pretty homey."
Home Coffee Roasters,Above and beyond 🥲 the bunny in my delicious but not overly sweet coconut vanilla latte was sublime and my friends birthday cake latte also incredible 💓 will be coming back for sure. The ambiance was also just so inviting with the big windows and cozy corners. …
Home Coffee Roasters,"Let me start off by saying if you like sweet coffee, this is the place to go! I only have tried the birthday cake latte so far and it's 🥵👁️🫦👁️☀️💥🔥.  There are a lot of good treats that you would expect from a coffee shop and they do it right, both by the metrics of looks and taste. Avocado toast is where it's at for a quick healthy pick-me-up!  Atmosphere wise, it's a nicely designed coffee shop. Great aesthetic inside, but really didn't look like a coffee shop from the outside, was a little hard to see compared to the other shops in the china town district.  The staff there is nice and my gosh the barista who made my drink, the dude is an absolute artist. Given that it wasn't that busy, he really took his time making a masterpiece of my drink. The focus and attention to detail when creating the latte art was a sight and I was impressed by how detailed he was. Something as simple as making coffee was turned into an art form for me yesterday.  I'm excited to come back and try all the wonderful creations and flavors they have here. If you're an adventurous coffee connesiaur, Home Coffee Roasters is the shop for you!"
Home Coffee Roasters,Had a good cappuccino. Coffee and milk are well balanced. Service is great and beverages are served relatively fast. Barista could even remember my name while i’m leaving despite a busy morning. I’m impressed!
Home Coffee Roasters,Great quality coffee. Interesting flavours like coconut vanilla latte. Service was fast and friendly. Limited seating but great open feel with air circulating. Recommended.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Great friendly coffee shop with lots of different latte options. The latte art is so cute , it made my day. The buttery croissant was warm and flaky. Overall chill and friendly vibes."
Home Coffee Roasters,One of the best coffee places in town with sometimes really creative flavors. My personal favorite is their coconut vanilla latte. The cafe itself is really cute too - perfect for a catch-up or working remotely. May get a little loud during rush hour.
Home Coffee Roasters,Great coffee! Cool variety of creative drinks!! We loved this coffee shop and it definitely deserves 5 stars!! Love the homey vibe!!
Home Coffee Roasters,"Perfect cafe experience. Great atmosphere and staff, the coffee is stellar and the latte art is so cute. They don't drown their coffee in sweetener, there is a good balance between the milk/flavoring and the coffee itself. Their whole bean selection is great and the bag art is cool too. The owners clearly care about this place, it shows. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Their croissant is really delicious especially when it’s warmed up!  They close really early during the day but doesn’t open until 7:30am so you only have a short amount of time period to get your coffee.  I ordered macchiato and it’s not latte macchiato, instead it’s espresso macchiato so expect a 3oz/small sized cup of coffee.  I give 4stars because it was better than the average but not ‘wow’ good."
Home Coffee Roasters,Their latte is really good! And latte art is very beautiful. They have couple of options and the staff is nice. Indoor atmosphere is very pleasing. There’s space to get some work done while enjoying a good latte.
Home Coffee Roasters,I was drawn in by the latte art and cute aesthetic and I stayed for the delicious drinks and toast. Avocado toast tasted fresh and bright. I got an iced caramel latte and my boyfriend got an iced chai. The staff were very friendly too!
Home Coffee Roasters,The guys there are amazing. The best coffee I had in my San Francisco visit. The cafe is so clean and pristine. The boys were so friendly with amazing. And what can I say about their amazing talent of the coffee art. They even asked my boy what he wants on his hot chocolate. I will definitely send all my friends from Australia whenever they visit San Francisco. Thank you so much for being so awesome.
Home Coffee Roasters,I technically didn't try out the food but there wasn't an option for just the coffee/drinks. The beans that they had was pure blissful. I had an Americano which is my go to. It was slightly sweet and settle a great roasted coffee. The smell was gentle and made my day with just the right caffeine in the morning. It didn't have any bitter taste at the end worth trying and supporting the local cafe shops. The place alone was cute and clean and the layout was quite and big. Plenty of space to sit with friends or even working on your laptop. My go to spot !!
Home Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee joint in SF!!! Spent the first part of my visit to the USA really struggling to find good coffee. Coffee everywhere here tastes like pod machine coffee — watered down, no crema, milk was not creamy and smooth, but this place was the closest thing to home in Australia. This place saved my day and my time in SF. Thank the lord. 10/10 jigglypuff art"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Very cute working cafe with wifi, plugs and good food/coffee. Nice part of SF."
Home Coffee Roasters,Incredible avocado toast (Bravo with a fried egg on top) and the best cafe au lait ice ever had!
Home Coffee Roasters,Great selection of coffee available here Service was good Coffee above my expectation which was really good and sweet. Accepts card for payment
Home Coffee Roasters,"First time going here and I loved it! The coffee was strong and delicious, plus the cute art. I loved the avocado toast I got. Only issue was the butter knife was too dull to cut the toast, but besides that the coffee and toast were tasty and yummy. I shared this place with my coworkers to visit when they come into the office as well 🙏🏼🤩"
Home Coffee Roasters,Loved visiting this Cafe on our trip to San Francisco. The baristas were friendly and the birthday cake latte was so cute and very tasty. I also enjoyed their matcha mochi muffin.
Home Coffee Roasters,"I ordered the ube latte which has a delicious, subtle flavor and is adorable to boot. I’ve previously tried their cold brew and chocolate croissant which were also good. I’m glad this is just around the corner and I look forward to trying more here!  Edit: Back again! The seasonal pumpkin pie latte is amazing👌"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Great drinks, excellent coffee and tea, great service. I come here every time I am in SF.  I went twice during my recent visit and observed people being impatient with the staff.  Just know there may be a wait and it’s ok to wait for deliciousness. If you can’t be patient for good things, go to Starbucks."
Home Coffee Roasters,The best coffee in SF! Coming from Australia where we take our coffee very seriously and need to start our day with a good one. Home coffee hits the spot - had an almond latte and loved it - will be back! The sunny spot in the window was a great way to start the day 😍
Home Coffee Roasters,Obsessed with this place. The coffee was really great. I ordered a lavender latte and the barista did a little Jigglypuff for me. It was so cute I got very excited. I also ordered the coketastic which exploded on the table and they cleaned it right up and were so kind. Would definitely come again!
Home Coffee Roasters,"Home Cafe is an open and relaxing coffee shop to come to any day of the week! Their staff is friendly and extremely knowledgeable about their menu. I strongly suggest getting the ""Br-avo"" avocado toast with bacon! Also, their latte art is unique and artistic. They are located only a few steps from the entrance to the Chinatown Gate.  Highly recommend!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"An experience with no flaws! The photo of the coffee, sign, and plant was taken while waiting for the avocado toast (Bravo + Fried Egg) and speaks to the quality of Home. I wasn’t expecting much from the fresh food as coffee is clearly their MO, but color me impressed. We will definitely make the effort to come back here."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Oh.My.God. heavenly coffee, they worked so hard to decorate them so beautifully, it was like watching an artist at work. And their mochi muffins... with purple yam... the chewiest, tastiest, full of flavor-est muffin! Definitely go there!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Speciality lattes cafe with toast options. Came here on a Sunday morning around 9:30am and there was a short line, but it moved quickly. You pay at the counter and then they call your name. Credit cards accepted. Ordered a matcha latte with oat milk ($1 extra) and got mine 50% sweet and hot. The latte was decent; my friend got the condensed milk latte and felt that hers was too sweet. There’s no indoor seating and only a few outdoor seating options. The overall vibe was cute and a spot to grab a drink before heading out to your next destination."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Amazing place !! I loved their coffee, their pastries and their avocado toast ! One of my favorite coffee in town for sure ! I tried the orange juice and the jasmine ice tea were both very tasty !"
Home Coffee Roasters,"This is my first time staying near the China town area. My client booked me for early meetings, so I looked on Google maps and found Home Coffee Roasters as a top-rated location (and it was conveniently a 2 minute walk from the hotel. I ordered their coconut vanilla latte and it was so good that I’ve come back every day of my trip. I ordered their avocado toast and a chocolate croissant that were incredible. And the people really make the experience and make you feel at home I highly recommend this spot for coffee lovers like myself."
Home Coffee Roasters,Clean open simple space. Medium roast coffee. Friendly staff.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Wonderful little coffee shop in China town. Spacious, great coffee, chill vibe. 10/10!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Worth the stop.  Coffee was well roasted, environment was lively, and the cappuccino was art.  Highly recommend should you find yourself on Grant."
Home Coffee Roasters,Delicious!! I ordered the birthday cake latte and it was delicious! Nice service
Home Coffee Roasters,"The coffee was decent although it was not warm enough. The chocolate croissant was delicious. Overall, good experience."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee and tea! WOW! I loved the friendly service, easy ordering, clean store, and best of all the quality coffee beans used.  Can't say enough - great place!"
Home Coffee Roasters,The lattes are great all around. So creative and fun. Staff was super pleasant and extremely kind. We spilled a bunch of coffee and were appreciative of their compassion. Will absolutely return. And promise to try really hard not to spill the next time.
Home Coffee Roasters,The most beautiful latte art I have seen in my entire life! The coffee was also incredibly smooth and the employees were very friendly.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Coffee was decent, but staff weren’t very friendly. I said thank you to three different people and received zero response from any of them. Four people behind the counter getting in the way of one actually working. The macchiato was well prepared, but wouldn’t recommend."
Home Coffee Roasters,Absolutely delicious coffee. Cute shop. Service was a touch slow.
Home Coffee Roasters,"The muffins are exquisite, so was the avocado toast. We both picked the lavender latte which was a delightful experience. Not only does everything look cute, but its also as good if not better than expected. We went there the day after chinese new year, right when it opened so maybe thats why the store felt a bit eerie, which is why I downvoted the atmosphere :)  Overall, I recommend giving it a try"
Home Coffee Roasters,Delicious coffee and breakfast toasts. Highly recommended for breakfast!
Home Coffee Roasters,"No line on a weekday morning while nearby chain coffee shops had lines out the door, and absolutely adorable drinks. Maybe better if you have time to stop and sip than if you’re just getting your caffeine fix."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Cute coffee shop in Chinatown with an inventive, creative menu. I tried their tea to keep it simple and it was a great drink. I will definitely return to try one of their creative drinks.  They also sell cute merchandise and swags."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee in the area, including Capps and Lattes. Attentive staff, chill ambience. Highly recommended especially if you are staying around the area."
Home Coffee Roasters,They kill it in aesthetics but don't assume they compromise quality. Their coffee drinks are delicious underneath their extremely grammable latte art. They sell great mochi baked goods from Third Culture.
Home Coffee Roasters,I got avocado toast with egg and a chocolate mint Latte. Everything was delicious! I ordered using the Square app but they had not prepared in time. Waited for a little bit. Didn’t mind that since everything tasted great!
Home Coffee Roasters,The coffee here is excellent! I wish I would have found this earlier in our trip. I will definitely come back next time!
Home Coffee Roasters,Nice space. Bright. Late and Matcha both very good.  Yummy Mocha muffins - great chewy texture.
Home Coffee Roasters,"rainbow vanilla latte!! 🌈🌈🌈🌈 so pretty, i am in love 😍"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Love this cafe, their baristas, and their latte art! 😍"
Home Coffee Roasters,Always adventurous so decided to seek out a recommendation and try Home Coffee Roasters. Easy convenient location just as you enter Chinatown. Friendly staff and the Barista is a rockstar!! Highly recommend Home Coffee Roasters!
Home Coffee Roasters,"""Thanks a latte for wearing a mask"". Lol, I'm still laughing about this line written on their cashier glass.  YEW: I had been looking forward to going to this event. I missed my Sunday RSVP because I ended up going out of town, but fortunately was still able to claim a latte some days later, so already +1 for friendly and understanding service.  Location: This was my first visit to Home Coffee Roasters. Due to my habitual isolation at home lately, I wasn't even aware it opened! I'm glad to have become aware of it though ofc. It's conveniently located downtown and walking distance from my current working situation (and also close to lots of transit options). Their indoor seating areas are still closed but looks cute; plus there are a couple of outdoor tables to chill at.  Service: As mentioned, service was great. I don't recall his name but the server was friendly and patient right from the start, even though he would have so many reasons to be stressed out since there were only two people working when I arrived and there was already a line formed all the way out the door. When I mentioned the birthday cake latte, he also took the time to explain it, setting the expectation that's it birthday cake inspired but is actually more vanilla-flavoured.  Food & Drink: The birthday cake latte is so beautiful <3, and also very suited to this month as Pride month. It's by no means a fast drink to make, but it was fun watching the process so that makes it all the more appreciated. I was concerned it would be like tooth achy sweet but it ended up being a perfect amount of sweetness, and it wasn't served too hot either (good for the warm weather outside). I also bought a chocolate mochi muffin (brownie?) to-go - it was good as well, though a little bit dry so I might skip it next time.  Can't wait to go back and try a different drink/treat soon!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Very friendly, lots of seating, yummy treats (got the Ube mochi donut) and good cold brew"
Home Coffee Roasters,"We came towards the end of the evening so the barista was tired and messed up the order. Also, we tried an ube mochi muffin but there was a fly inside the food cabinet so it was a bit disheartening. They also ran out of decaf espresso unfortunately. That being said, the lavender latte was delicious and looked super cute. The baristas are definitely talented! Also the decor is absolutely amazing. The owner must have spent a lot of time and energy designing the place with great colors. Even the bathroom was well done and super calming."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Walked around the area for awhile, most cafe's had no seating or standing room only. Finally found this gem, good simple foods and nice lattes. Best of all they have a huge table with plugs under which is great for working on the laptop. It was my second time ending up here to work and made me realize how special this cafe is!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"They have great coffee and toasts. The traditional espresso drinks are good, and so are the ones off of the creative menu. We had a macchiato, red velvet latte, and an iced lavender latte. The food menu is reduced right now from what’s on the website menu.  We had the “Let’s avo-cuddle” and it was simple and very tasty."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Great latte art, good pastries, and fine coffee."
Home Coffee Roasters,"This is definitely my new favourite coffee shop near work - having been a barista for 5 years, this is quite something 😜 you can't go wrong here: filter coffee, a colourful latte, tea, pastries, everything is delish 💜 and their staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. See you soon @Home! …"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Ridiculously delicious seasonal drink (Ubae latte) and great staff, sunlight. Toast is fluffy and chewy and nice flavor with avo."
Home Coffee Roasters,Really cute coffee shop right at the entrance of China Town.
Home Coffee Roasters,Delicious cup of coffee with amazing art design. Too pretty to drink! I love that the drink was not super sweet like some other coffee shops. Great positive vibes here.
Home Coffee Roasters,Cozy little coffee that we discovered while skipping our standard coffee in Mazarine. And we were pleasantly surprised so definitely recommend.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Small coffeeshop with desserts, avocado toast and they sell their own whole bean coffee. I bought the Sunset Blend."
Home Coffee Roasters,"- visited their stand at the filipino festival and tried the iced ube latte. it was extremely refreshing with a slight ube flavor and wasn’t too sweet. - also tried the lavender latte recently which i enjoyed. lavender flavor wasn’t overpowering and the drink was perfectly sweetened! - service is great, workers are friendly, and the art was so cute!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"There's really only good coffee ($5+ tax + tip), counter service, hard seats, clean and bright and sorta noisy; but tough to beat for a morning or afternoon wake up. But, really, honestly, when is the cap decoration school going to open? I can't do this at hone."
Home Coffee Roasters,Best coffee we’ve had in SF! Had to get the birthday cake latte to see how it was done…
Home Coffee Roasters,Forget Starbucks!!! This place is right around the corner of from the Worldmark resort I was staying at. The coffee was freaking amazing. The little time and effort put in to create these custom coffee is A1! Super affordable! And tastes GREAT!!!!
Home Coffee Roasters,Finally get to do my review of this delicious and well run establishment! Carl is awesome as are all the other homies here and they make delicious coffee paired with friendly and attentive service! Continue to support your local establishments especially restaurant and food establishments!
Home Coffee Roasters,The latte art is impeccable! So cute! 🥰 will definitely come back again!
Home Coffee Roasters,The birthday cake latte was delicious and super fun to watch the barista make! The churro mochi muffin was to die for. Indoor seating is not currently available which was a bummer because the cafe is really cute but I’d definitely come back
Home Coffee Roasters,"It's a slick little cafe with a team of talented baristas. They put the extra mile into their espresso prep & brewing, and it pays off. It's an unfortunate truth of the coffee industry that many spots known for cute latte art -- a skill in and of itself to be sure -- aren't prioritizing good coffee brewing. This joint, though, manages both delicious espresso & adorable art."
Home Coffee Roasters,Great place to relax and enjoy a smooth coffee after about an hour of walking around the neighborhood; definitely recommend.
Home Coffee Roasters,Really solid coffee and super quick/convenient. Also seems like a nice place to spend time in Chinatown
Home Coffee Roasters,All three locations are filled with such talented baristas. Every birthday cake latte I've ordered has been the most impressive drink I've ever seen!
Home Coffee Roasters,"Amazing service, nicest baristas in the city! Great tea and coffee, unique menu of fun new coffee drinks to try. Lovely, inviting vibe and a big space which is hard to find in this area. And they have WiFi! Will make this a regular."
Home Coffee Roasters,"The coffee was really wonderful, the specialty lattes really inventive and the personnel sooo kind. My birthday cake latte was so pretty and tasted very good. My husband really liked their iced coffee as well. I also got some whole bean coffee that I’m looking forward to trying. Nice add on - you get a free coffee with the purchase of beans."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Best Espresso in SF. Amazing taste , perfect roast. Food is also good."
Home Coffee Roasters,"If you want a different kind of coffee experience, this is it! I like the clean, white modern look, the Lavender Latte is very nice! Their seasonal lattes are pumpkin pie and ube!"
Home Coffee Roasters,very nice environment and nice Coffee. Gotten the chocolate mint latte and the taste is rich.
Home Coffee Roasters,Best coffee in San Francisco so far! So cute and the almond cappuccio was amazing
Home Coffee Roasters,"Cute little place just past Dragon's Gate. Heavy on the Instagramable latte art but in a good way. The coffee is excellent and the staff is super friendly. I had never had a mochi muffin before and I am now in love with them.  The decor is Japanese-like -- clean and simple, bright and minimalist. There's WiFi and seating for about 15 people. Nice atmosphere."
Home Coffee Roasters,One of the best coffee places around! Love their huge variety of unique coffee flavors. Highly recommend!  We had the Birthday Cake Latte and Pumpkin Pie Latte.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Was visiting SF this weekend and stopped here before getting dimsum in Chinatown. Really fun place with a bright and open airy vibe. We had an Iced London Fog which was great and just the right amount of sweet. Also, we had the Nutella Latte with Oatmilk and really enjoyed it! It was less sweet than I imagined it could be. Tasty with a nice sweet and nutty after taste!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Amazing latte art and so delicious, great esthetic and friendly staff!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Below average speciality drinks. The iced cookie monster only had a light hint of cookie flavor. It tasted more like cookie water. 🥴My family and I were really disappointed with all of our drinks! Especially after waiting 30 minutes for the drinks, they took 10 minutes to make my last drink and brushed me off when I politely reminded them about it. Better off going to Starbucks 😒"
Home Coffee Roasters,"It's a simple place with simple needs. I would try their pastries with coffee.  Staff is very welcoming.  I had the Cafe au le,mind the spelling, and ignored the cute bear the batista artfully made....it was smooth...."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Amazing coffee, the best in San Fran. The service was fantastic, couldn't rate this place high enough. Ideal for any Australian coffee lover..."
Home Coffee Roasters,Very nice hip coffee place to try ;-)  They have lotta different flavors which are worth a try :-)
Home Coffee Roasters,"Cozy cafe with pretty decent coffee. Their pourovers are well-extracted, sweet and tasty!"
Home Coffee Roasters,Great coffee! The birthday cake latte with oat milk is one of my favorites. Friendly staff and quick service.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Whoa slowest coffee ever. Was staying around the corner and needed an americano before running to a meeting at 8 AM. I ordered with assurances they could make it quickly (line had been moving slowly while baristas chatted), and left 17 min later—with no coffee. I guess a place known for “latte art” wasn’t a good choice for someone just wanting some solid espresso in 10 min or less. Avoid if you don’t have a very leisurely morning."
Home Coffee Roasters,Very good coffee and choice of gluten free mochi muffins. Very friendly and tentative staff.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Beautiful coffee shop with some workspace. Unfortunately I was there when it was 95F and only had an iced tea even though I originally came for the amazing Latte art! They also have a water refill station, which was really helpful to stay hydrated :)"
Home Coffee Roasters,"We loved the taste of the coffee. We had cappuccinos with regular and almond milk, both were delicious and creamy, with beautiful barista art."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Super cute, clean coffee shop. Friendly and efficient service. Can't wait to try more of their menu!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"This is a friendly local hipster coffee spot just steps inside the Chinatown gate. They feature their own light roasts in pourover, batch and mechanized. I have had some really outstanding coffee here. They know their craft.. Mateo even gave me some knowledge on adjusting two different models of espresso machines."
Home Coffee Roasters,Great coffee but not very clean friendly place. Wouldn’t go back again
Home Coffee Roasters,Definitely went for the fun coffee art. The coffee was good and the service was just s good.
Home Coffee Roasters,Best cookie affogato I’ve ever had!
Home Coffee Roasters,"I've been here twice when I have visited SF and their coffee tasted great each time. Before COVID, I ordered this birthday cake latte and it tasted so sweet, perfectly balancing out the coffee. The latte art was cute as well, it included different colors and rainbow sprinkles. The second time I went was a month ago. I ordered the cookie butter latte and it tasted sooo smooth. You could taste the cookie and the butter, but the flavor melts in your mouth. They also added mini choco chip cookies to my drink. Employees are friendly and the shop is clean.  One of my favorite coffee spots in the city!"
Home Coffee Roasters,This was a pleasant place for a cup of coffee.  Good flavor and reasonable wait time
Home Coffee Roasters,Best cappuccino in town. Great and friendly service! Thank you! ❤️
Home Coffee Roasters,Cool atmosphere with inventive coffee and the most friendly staff.
Home Coffee Roasters,Nice little place in Chinatown. The pour over Ethiopian I tried was very good. Have to try their other stuff.
Home Coffee Roasters,"If you're looking for a good third wave coffee in the area definitely go to Home. Well prepared matcha and regular latte's. The avo toasts were in top two for the weekend (the Mill was other for a different style). They had a variety of other more creative drinks like a churro latte and the more colorful ones you see photos of that I would try in the future.  Lived in SF for 13 years before moving late 2021.  Did not expect SF quality coffee while staying in this area to visit friends. Typically drank Andytown, Equator, and Ritual when I lived in SF and was glad that the lattes from Home did not disappoint."
Home Coffee Roasters,Great place for creative and great coffee and a sweet or savory pastry.
Home Coffee Roasters,We got ourselves a sea salt caramel latte and a lavender latte and both were delicious and really well made. Loved the latte art on the lavender latte!
Home Coffee Roasters,"We were excited to try this local coffee shop. We ordered a chai tea latte and chocolate mint latte. I was really disappointed in my chai tea latte. It was not even hot. I'd say it was lukewarn and because the temperature was not right, it didn't bring out the flavor. The chocolate mint was average as well. We didn't think it was worth the price and wouldn't go back.  The only positive was the customer sericice. They were friendly."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Amazing drinks, great food, in a great location. Came here on my first day in SF and HAD to come back the next day. I got the Coconut Vanilla Latte and an Avocado Toast. It was honestly the best latte I have ever had and the avocado toast was great! Coming back on my next visit for sure."
Home Coffee Roasters,"I love the minimalistc, clean, and neat interior design. It's very aesthetically pleasing and calming. The americano and cold brew are both equally refreshing and caffeine heavy. Baristas are always sweet and friendly too. Would definitely recommend!"
Home Coffee Roasters,Coffee was decent (we got the cold brew and lavender latte) but definitely not worth the price. Better off at a few other coffee shops in the city.
Home Coffee Roasters,Friendly baristas and a very tasty iced honey lavender latte. I really wanted one with their beautiful latte art but a 70 degree day full of walking hills called for ice. I’ll return every time I’m in town!
Home Coffee Roasters,A great small coffee shop with amazing pore overs and friendly staff
Home Coffee Roasters,"Tasty, could use better cup material tho."
Home Coffee Roasters,Great place for creative coffee and cute latte art :)
Home Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, great food and a great spot to get work done."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Had a decaff oat milk cappuccino which was lovely, and a ham and gruyère croissant which was fantastic!"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Absolutely love the space and one of the best lattes in the city, hands down!! Love the staff here and the couple behind the business, great biz to support"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Stopped in for some coffee while visiting San Francisco. Asked to use the restroom since we are paying customers and were told that the restroom was closed. Employees proceeded to allow one of their regular customers use the restroom. When confronted, both employees explained that they were long time friends and they were sorry but the bathroom is still closed. I’ll take my business elsewhere next time as discriminatory “rules” like this are too hard to swallow. Too bad because the coffee was good but the experience left a terrible taste in our mouth."
Home Coffee Roasters,Their mochi muffin was worth a try.
Home Coffee Roasters,Coffee is great but the AC is not turned on
Home Coffee Roasters,The coffee was really good and the place looked really cute.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Nice people, quick service, cute latte art and very tasty drinks! We ordered 2 coconut lattes, one hot and one iced. Both were really good."
Home Coffee Roasters,Tasty avocado toasts and adorable latte art. :)
Home Coffee Roasters,Loved the one experience of coming here. Highly recommend. Awesome art!
Home Coffee Roasters,Great coffee with amazing latte art!!
Home Coffee Roasters,So good👌🏼
Home Coffee Roasters,Friendly service every visit. Cookie Monster Latte is very good as is the Hot Chocolate amd Mocha beverages.. Clean bright space with all current social distance protocols followed.
Home Coffee Roasters,"1/3 of my expensive, bad tasting toast that I got instead of a pastry (because of the fruit flies in the pastry case) was too charred to eat (it was pitch black), talked to staff but nothing happened. Disappointed as I had higher expectations for service from my experience with other institutions. Coffee was average as well, for your own happiness please go to andytown if you want coffee and boba guys has toast twice as big, better tasting, and not charred for half the price."
Home Coffee Roasters,Great coffee!
Home Coffee Roasters,Trendy new coffee place.  Good espressos with some creative flair.
Home Coffee Roasters,I can highly recommend this cafe. They have a great selection of different coffee preparations and very tasty baked goods. The team is super nice.
Home Coffee Roasters,MUST GO. Best latte I have ever had.
Home Coffee Roasters,Really enjoyed their lavender latte!
Home Coffee Roasters,"Probably the best cappuccino we had in the US so far, it wasn't easy to find a great place around that has speciality coffee, but finally found one."
Home Coffee Roasters,Art in a cup! These lattes are pricey don’t get me wrong ($8) but the art is super cute!
Home Coffee Roasters,"New space with soft opening as of September 20th, but this is the first time I've stopped in. The barista made a great suggestion for the pourover. The Ethiopian is delicious! I look forward to checking out other options on their menu. Clean space with lots of potential seating in a great location."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Honestly it was just okay. I had high hopes after browsing the menu online, but when I got there it took so long to order then I get my latte and it didn’t taste AT ALL like red velvet. Won’t be back"
Home Coffee Roasters,This place is great. Love the simple modern layout. And they have this little guy. Cookie-Gato
Home Coffee Roasters,"Get the Cookie Monster latte and a matcha mochi muffin, thank me later !"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Thank you, loved the holiday bird figurines & Navidad tree last month."
Home Coffee Roasters,Drip coffee wasn't good ¬ very warm.
Home Coffee Roasters,Ice cream for breakfast is great
Home Coffee Roasters,Walked in hoping to purchase some mochi muffins / donuts from third culture bakery.  Walked out because the display case was swarmed by fruit flies while the baristas were busy helping others.  Questioning if I will return since that did not leave a great first impression. Perhaps they should do what Mazarine does and have a closed display case and a hidden pull out drawer full of pastries under the display case.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Their mochi muffin is from Third Culture Bakery, who thinks they can own the noun “mochi muffin.” Need to change supplier."
Home Coffee Roasters,"The birthday cake latte is the cutest thing imaginable, and all the drinks are very tasty!"

Home Coffee Roasters,We had a matcha latte and a choclate mint. Both were very good and a true work of art!!! The avocado toast was really delicious. The bathroom was very stylish and clean.
Home Coffee Roasters,"Red velvet latte! Delicious! Super soft, different. The attention and the atmosphere is very good."
Home Coffee Roasters,"I went because the ratings were good and the picture of the latte was pretty. It's in Chinatown and seems to be run by Chinese people. The interior and atmosphere seem to suit Koreans well. It's neat and cute. I ordered a Happy Birthday Latte. It feels like the beans are not strong, and the sweetness sinks to the bottom of the coffee. At first, it tastes like a latte... It gets sweeter as you drink more and more. There are many types of latte, and it would be good for those who want to get pretty latte photos. And for those who don't like strong coffee... The staff were friendly and it was clean. Personally, it's about 4.5 stars."
Home Coffee Roasters,"Good place to have a latte, the breakfast is not so complete for what you pay, the drinks are very rich and have a very good presentation, the baristas are very friendly and the menu is varied"
Home Coffee Roasters,"Very good coffee and a really pretty café, especially if you don't want an Americano but want a real espresso."
