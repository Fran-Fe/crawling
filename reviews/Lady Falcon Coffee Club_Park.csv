Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Small Coffee truck on top of Alamo Square Park. The servers were super nice and accommodating. Got the mocha and while it was a bit pricey, it didn’t disappoint. Great location for a coffee truck. Can grab your drink and sit in front of the painted ladies, walk around, or even play tennis after haha."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Thank you for stopping by!!
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"The location is beautiful, the coffee truck is up the hill. The are 3 tables that belong to the truck were you can seat and there's also enough sitting area around the park. You can buy coffee beans and tea from them. The prices are high for the quality of the product that you get. We got the pink crush is just agua de Jamaica or hibiscus tea tbh they raise your expectations and you end up paying for something that is not worth it. Then, we got the dirty chai which is spiced and good(not sweetened) and a regular iced latte which was good not overpowering not missing flavor. The girls in the truck are very friendly,they explained the menu to us and gave us fast service. You are mostly paying for the experience and the view."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"We got the Choco Loco and the Cold Brew with cream and vanilla. While the coffee was sufficient, the location in Alamo Square to walk the park and see the Painted Ladies landmark is clutch. The park is so beautiful and it’s nice having a coffee while walking around. I’m also not a big fan of their cardboard straws, but that’s San Fran for ya."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Thank you!!💗
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Whenever I am on a stroll on Alamo, you will always find me at Lady Falcon to grab some coffee. I get their iced vanilla latte and it’s so yummy but also isn’t overpowering sweet. I love sweet coffee but their coffee isn’t that sweet and I somehow love it so much. I can finish it in 5 minutes. The location is perfect, and their merch is so cute I got a tote bag and got a free coffee too! Added bonus: tons of cute dogs around the truck :)"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,i was very excited about this specific coffee location more so because of the location than the coffee itself. we ordered a simple vanilla iced coffee which took too long to be served and then once we walked to our car with coffee in hand and a few swirls of the straw we noticed it was full of coffee grinds. we weren't about to walk back and ask for another one because something that simple shouldn't be messed up. this is just an fyi to the staff and hope they improve on it.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Hi Fernando, I am so so sorry to read this.  I would love to offer you a refund.  Please accept my apology for your experience. Sincerely, Buffy Maguire"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"beautiful truck in alamo park. great view of the city. very good coffee, in spite of being consumed in a disposable cup, while standing (or sitting on the lawn)."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Cutest little coffee shop /truck with great views. A variety of milk choices, which I always appreciate. High quality machines and beans. You can even buy a bag to go!"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Seriously such a great company. I am super biased but so should you if you support something.  First, the coffee and tea is SO good! Beautiful packaging. I ordered two coffees and two teas and completely worth it.  I live in the city and they do 24hr delivery. I submitted an order sometime on a TH and by M I had yet to receive anything. Contacted support and the informed me that it had been dropped off that Friday 😭. Some savage stole it from my stairs because it’s so beautiful!  The team was incredible and redelivered what I had ordered the very next day! Really delicious coffee and tea, great to share with great people. I wouldn’t, it’s too good!"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Now THAT was great coffee. I had a double espresso with a dollop of the very best whipped cream. My girls loved their hot chocolates too. The two women working in the truck were very nice too. Great view of the Painted Ladies. Was well worth the hills we climbed to get to the neighborhood!!!
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,“Forgot” I ordered anything because I didn’t tip lol… there wasn’t even anyone else waiting for a drink. Also cold brew is almost $7 💀

Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"7 dollars for a small cup of coffee, and they flip over the screen asking for a tip on top of this. Average coffee."

Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Way overpriced and poor service. Paid $6 for a cold brew the size of a sippy cup. Asked for “just a little” half & half and my coffee came back white. Do not recommend.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Best coffee ee had in San Fransisco. The pastries are excelent.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Thank you!!💗
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Great coffee, great location and great baristas. My puppy loves this place because Bridgette and Julia always give her a pup cup/puppucinno. They have some donuts from Bob's Donuts and have a few tables with a great view of the Painted Ladies. Good for both tourists and locals to enjoy some coffee and a nice walk around Alamo Square."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"I DO NOT understand how they can have anything less than 5 stars across the board. This precious biz is run by a team of sweet (and bada$$) ladies, the coffee is always good and their vibes are hella chill. I get their 5lb bags shipped to my place every month, and it even includes a small token for a free drink 😭✨ …"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Delicious coffee beans, great beverages, and super cute spot! I love everything there is to know about this fantastic coffee shop and roasting spot. All lady roasted coffee? Heck yes! Adorable packaging that's fantastic for gifts as well as just enjoying having in my house? Heck yes! Local, wonderful, delicious AF, and very beautiful."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Their roasted coffee is amazing! I got the Epic. Love the complex taste.  When you buy one you get any free drink! I tried the “petit latte” (the size of a cortado, but more foamy) which was great in the go.  The second time I got their Mocha, which was a real dessert treat, begging to be sipped slowly."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Nice coffee and location but $5.75 plus taxes for a Latte from a van is pretty outrageous.   Very poor value for money.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Hi there, I am sorry you did not feel it was valuable.  Unfortunately, our costs are very high.  Having explained that, I am very happy to refund you since you are not satisfied.  Please email us at info@ladyfalconcoffeeclub.com so we can process your refund. Thank you. Sincerely, Team Lady Falcon"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"An aqesome surprise in the park, I really was not expecting to taste the best coffee in St Francisco there. The lovely ladies have their own coffee beans and use a ""la marzocco"" expreso machine which is one of the best tools to do coffee. I really want to see the painted ladies again just to taste this coffee."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Great spot to grab a delicious coffee. Thank you, ladies."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,💜💜💜
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,I buy two bags of their coffee and get two free drinks! Love the design on the bags and coffee is very good. Highly recommend whenever you're visiting the park to see painting ladies or just taking a walk around the neighborhood.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"One of my absolute best experiences in SF! I've been checking off a bunch of places that I kept on a list to visit, those that come as the highest recommended coffee places in the city. Lady Falcon was not even on my list at the time when I happened to find their logo sticker stuck to a chair at a restaurant in the Mission. Well, something inside of me must have spoken because I was dutifully compelled to seek them out the very next morning. What a great confluence of women, coffee, art, style, and culture! Oh, and the coffee quality  itself is superb in every way, sourced, roasted and brewed to my utter delight."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,They like coffee but are allergic to it. Some of the nicest and friendliest teammates I've ever known worked there. This is a must-see coffee shop where you can enjoy a tasty cup of coffee. It is unquestionably a must-try!
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,The truck is really cool. The coffee & tea were excellent and the service was outstanding during a bustling day at the park!
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Thank you!
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Try a petit latte, it's small, strong and yummy, will give you that boost for sure. Their beans are also very good"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"This is a great spot, that delivers really delicious coffee and hot chocolate, and coffee beans. The location is beautiful, located as it is inside one of San Francisco's most wonderful parks. On a sunny day, this is where you want to be."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Adorable coffee stand in the perfect location.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Thank youuuuu
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"You can have a great morning park moment, grab a coffee, and soak in a clear SF day. They also usually have Bob's donuts to go with your coffee."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"This is the place to go if you're looking for a coffee shop! The staff is upbeat and courteous. The food was great, and the coffee was exceptional. It's a fantastic offer in a fantastic place!"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Just a PSA!!! This coffee is absolutely incredible, but they definitely do not open at 8am. If you want coffee from here, wait until later in the morning!"
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,So sorry! We've updated our hours on Google to reflect the later start on Saturdays and Sundays.
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"A fun little surprise on the hill in the park. The coffee is just what you'd expect, warm (or iced) and roasted to perfection. Enjoy a cup, and of course the view."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,"Great service. The Mexican mocha should just be called a ganache or mocha, it lacks flavor/spices to be called a Mexican mocha. Also lacked chocolate flavor."
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,She refused to provide service to me because I didn’t have my mask on. This is a mobile coffee shop with her wearing a mask and has a glass window to prevent any contact with customer. Horrible service will never buy coffee from them
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,Great coffee and amazing views!
Lady Falcon Coffee Club,I flippin love the coffee in the park experience Lady Falcon provides. Thank you guys for the awesome coffee and the prime location ❤️❤️❤️
