Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Very cute and clean cafe. Fast service! Most importantly: amazing food and great coffee. I recommend the almond Danish, the best I've had in a long time. I also like that they do little hearts on the coffers very cute."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Brittany for you kind and thorough review! we really appreciate it :}
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,This is my favorite spot in the city to grab coffe or wonderful snacks. They have fresh delicious empanadas and pastries. Staff is always welcoming and the atmosphere is calm. It’s a great space to do remote work or read. They have outdoor and indoor sititing. I will keep coming back.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Cafe Bodega is an amazing father/son owned and ran business in Downtown SF. The coffee is fresh, flavorful, and made to order (pour overs). The Carlos were welcoming and really educated me on the origins and thesis of their coffee beans harvesting and production. Brought a few colleagues today to try and they felt equally happy. This location is a great to work from or meet up. Cant' wait for the next shop to open."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Pedro for your very kind review, and for bringing your colleagues!. It was a pleasure meeting you."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Great coffee and great people.  I stumbled upon this shop when it was on Fillmore and would drop in on my way to work. The cappuccino is as I like it and far better and leas expensive than the $8 ones being offered in North Beach. Since they moved, I try to make the trek down to California Street to enjoy the great coffee and the great conversation when it is not too busy. It is worth the walk, it is worth the wait if any. Check it out! Got the Honey Cinnamon Latte this time. Tasty."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Thomas for your review and patronage, It's always a pleasure to have you."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Coffee Bodega was my favourite boutique coffee shop in downtown San Francisco.  The quality of the coffee and its preparation were outstanding.  I had the chance to talk to the owner, who is a person with a great passion for people having an excellent coffee experience.  Thus, his dedication and attention to detail have converted this unique place into an incomparable Costa Rican theme coffee shop worth often visiting for a break or to close a business. The pour-over La Pastora Tarrazú was exquisite!  Also, it is conveniently located a few steps from Market St, Embarcadero, and one of the cable - car stations."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"For people that love pure, excellent, refined coffee this is the best in SF! Additionally the inside of the space is beautiful, in a prime location, with a very passionate and friendly staff. Strongly recommend the iced latte with oat milk 🤙🏽 …"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Farshad for you very kind review, we really appreciate it!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Saw this cute coffee shop on the way to getting my nails done in FiDi and had to stop by afterwards.  The employees there were really friendly and I definitely sensed a passion for their craft.  My oat milk cappucino was great :).  Great internal seating inside and it was a good vibe inside.  Good for mid-day meetings if you work in the FiDi area, or if you're simply in the area running errands or visiting.  It's a nice tucked away place to grab a coffee and a bite.  Excited that this location is in the neighborhood!  Can't wait to try their drip coffee and their other coffee items on the menu."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Kai for your review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Great coffee and friendly owners. I’ve been coming here for almost a year now and have no complaints. Really enjoy the experience. Super cozy and must try if you like specialty coffee
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Very unpleasant experience. Brought a dog on leash, upfront ordering the owner told me it’s a farm to table so dog not allowed, I said I will dine outside, he says “ok make it quick”, in a very unpleasant way. He rushed the ordering process and very unkind. Later he came out to explained the situation, but he just explained for himself, not sincere at all. Felt like not welcomed at all, and they are not kind. I went there because I read all the good reviews and thought it was a must go coffee shop in town. Honestly after the whole experience I can’t even remember how the coffee taste, being respected is more important than flavor."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Sheng, as I kindly explained to you, it is unlawful to bring a dog into a coffee shop. The California Food Code prohibits the presence of pets in food facilities, like a coffee shop, because they present a health threat to some people and are unsanitary. Bringing a dog into a food facility, that is not a service animal trained to help you with a disability that you have, is unlawful, not to mention inconsiderate and selfish. I understand that people are attached to their pets, but your rights end where other people’s rights begin. People have the right to enjoy their food and drinks free of animal fur and saliva. We intend to keep our coffee shop an enjoyable and save place for everyone.  Sheng, I really hope you understand that you are “breaking the law” when entering a coffee shop with a pet, because after reading your review, it does not seem that you do.  We have a camera security system that records audio and video exactly for these situations. I’m happy to upload the videos if you feel that things happened differently."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Fantastic father/son ownership duo. Kind and professional. Not to mention the coffee is top notch. I love the cinnamon latte but can’t go wrong with any of their espresso drinks.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Really nice place. I'd find myself coming here for a cup of coffee while waiting for my partner to get out from work at Starbucks. I enjoy the coffee here. I would recommend to those who are looking for a new spot to relax, and have a cup of coffee that aren't from a chain"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"This has to be my favorite coffee shop in SF! Not only is the coffee amazing, but it’s a great, relaxing space that’s conveniently located downtown. Carlos is always welcoming and since it’s a family run business, you can tell they care about their quality and their customers’ experience in the shop. It’s truly a gem!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Marlena for your very kind review! 
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"On July 15, 2022, I visited a new Coffee Cafe at 1 California called ""Bodega Farm-to Table"". This Cafe is located in the former Peet's coffee location at Embarcadero & Drumm. Since I was in transit, I simply ordered a house coffee. In the short time at the Cafe, I immediately realized the kaleidoscope of special features such as the coffee, ambience and service. I give the Cafe and Coffee 5 stars. The coffee was smooth, clean tasting, with hints of chocolate. I was not able to sit and enjoy the ambience. But standing inside, I felt comfortable because of the lighting and dark wood interior design. The Cafe offers pastries and empanadas which I will try next time. The customer service person was laid back and chilled so this also felt comfortable. If you are in the area of Embarcadero/Drumm/Market Street, please treat yourself. July 25, 2022, I finally returned to try the Vegetarian Empanadas. Small but powerful. Cheesy, Greens (Spinach), Bell pepper. Yummy (lecker) In German!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Eddie for thorough and kind review, we appreciate it very much! Hope you have more time on your next visit. ;)"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Coffee was very weak for me personally. I had the reserve pour over. The pastry was super soft and seems like a left over from the weekend. For the price it's a major disappointment after seeing the rating.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Wonderful customer service Deicious coffee, teas, pasteies and empanadas. Classy decor and a peaceful atmosphere to relax with a book o in good company.  Glad to have Coffee Bodega in my radar!  New opening soon in downtown San Francisco!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,What a great family owned place.  They use Costa Rica coffee only.  And honestly that was never on my radar.  Well it is now.   What great coffee. And super nice people.  Please check them out.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,I wanted to like this place. But chai tea latte was so bland. Paid $7 and I can barely taste the spices. Also the owner and worker were not friendly. I paid for the drink and he just stood there and didn’t say thank you or anything. It was more like he was annoyed by my presence. I misunderstood that they were closing at 1 when I came in. they could have said they were closed if they didn’t want to serve anymore.I would completely understand. But service can definitely be better.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,On a cross country trip with my mom we stopped at this lovely little jewel! We love coffee and was very pleased with this choice. The coffee was fresh and tasted amazing. It balanced out wonderfully with the Apple turnover! Carlos was wonderful!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you for your review Loren! It was great meeting you.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,The man wouldn't accept my cash tip for whatever reason. Didn't speak to me or even offer me any cream but the customer after me was treated very well and he even asked how her day was going. I felt very unwelcome and i think he wanted me to know it. Great coffee but i went to see my therapist after.  And I'm just wondering whats the point of street signs when not everyone is welcome.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Went for a walk around SF and stopped at this cute coffee spot. The coffee was amazing and we were so excited about our cheese danish we forgot to take a picture. I highly recommend stopping by if you’re ever in SF!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Really good quality pourover and the empanadas were great too. Really reminiscent of empanadas salteñas. Will be back!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,The Reservation Especial is probably one of the best coffee roasts I’ve had in a long time 👍
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Had a very unwarranted and intense interaction with a gentlemen here regarding my dog. Upon arriving, he immediately points at my dog if it’s a service animal and I answered yes. He shared that it’s different than a ESA and I answered that yes I understand the laws and that he is a service animal and I can show proof. He says no that’s okay but I felt like he kept looking at how the dog and I looked and bombarded me with more questioning when I got up to pay which was just bad vibes. I told him, look if you want to deny me service or cause such an unwarranted interaction, I can just leave. He kept saying no he “isn’t” denying me service but his actions and behavior didn’t showcase that. I told him, I’m not here to cause trouble, I am abiding to the laws, and there are hundreds of coffee shops here and I honestly don’t need this type of interrogation or have the time to argue for $4 coffee (lol). Such a rude and unpleasant experience. Will not be returning."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Worst coffee on this planet. The $4,50 espresso shot tasted sour as vinegar twice. Arrogant ignorant scruffy staff."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,My favorite place to get coffee downtown - Carlos is fantastic and the coffee is delicious! Highly recommend.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"The coffee here is really something else, I was impressed. The young barista is very hot. Definitely a must go if you're in FiDi."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Highly recommended. Friendly staff, a good amount of seating, and amazing coffee! The salted maple latte did not disappoint!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you for your review Hao, we really appreciate it. "
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Excellent coffee roasted in Costa Rica. It's the kind of Cafe you want to support. Sustainable, working with small farms, small business.  Walk up to the kiosk and order your drink. They have oats milk option. Definitely get my coffee here from now on when in Cow Hollow Marina district."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Louisa for your kind review. It was a pleasure meeting you!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,This place is the best for coffee..strong and darn good.  And they know how to make a flat white.  The father and son owners are always friendly...the way family business was at one time in San Francisco.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Tom for your kind review and patronage, we appreciate very much. "
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Service was good, coffee was fine, but the blueberry muffin looked and tasted like the ones from Costco"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Awesome local coffeeshop with outdoor seating and a takeout window. The latte I ordered was one of the bests in San Francisco-so smooth and fragrant. The owner Carlos was very friendly and I’d definitely come back for the great coffee and hospitality.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,The food and coffee are wonderful here. It's cozy and inviting. A highlight of my visit to San Francisco!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you for your kind review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Quiet place where I was able to chat with a friend for a couple of hours without feeling rushed. Good coffee and food, conveniently located."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Rochelle for your kind review, we appreciate it very much! "
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"My favorite local coffee spot. Unbeatable service from Carlos, he always gets my order right. Perfect location to just walk up and get a quick cuppa. Couldn’t recommend it enough!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,One of the best espresso-based coffees in the city. Smooth and great depth of flavor. 10/10 would return even though it's a trek from the Dogpatch! Carlos the owner is also a really friendly guy who clearly cares deeply about sourcing and making quality coffee.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Annika! I enjoyed speaking with you too.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"The coffee was extremely smooth. The owners are a father/son duo, and are friendly, knowledgable, and clearly care about the community. Overall amazing service and coffee. We will be back again!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Layla for your review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Just went here this morning on vacation from Kansas City. Honestly couldn’t find an open Starbucks crazy but very lucky because I found this place. BEST COFFEE EVER!! Way better than Starbucks. Staff was friendly. This will definitely be my go to coffee place in San Fran! Thank you
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Lacie for your kind review, we hope to have you when are back."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Terrific Coffee Carlos is a great barista and was able to give us exactly what we wanted.  The beans are super quality but it’s expensive – nicey but pricey!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"I never understood why people were such snobs about coffee until I had a cup made by Carlos. I lived near a couple other spots but after I discovered Coffee Bodega, I never went anywhere else!  After one visit, Carlos remembered my order and was always so thoughtful with each customer.  Hands down the best coffee I’ve ever had— i still think about it even though I moved out of the city a couple months ago.  Definitely check it out ☕️"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Marissa for you very kind review, we appreciate it very much."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Loved this little coffee pop up in the window of Jaxson! The owner was so nice and knowledgeable. And most importantly, the coffee was delicious! I had a cappuccino with oatmilk. We’ll be back soon!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you so much Hannah, it was very nice meeting you! We appreciate the review and pic posting :)"

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Amazing tasting coffee, and the kindest, most knowledgeable owner! Go support this awesome locally owned business! Cute outdoor seating as well!!! 💜 ☕️ …"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Coffee is delicious. They also didn’t charge me for almond milk, which was nice!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Adorable little coffee spot with delicious cold brew! Love the outdoor patio and great, quick service."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Tell my friend Carlos I say hi. This place may have got the best coffee in the U.S. Here, the espresso is well rounded, never too acidic. milk is never too hot, perfect amount of foam. Always quick and delicious. skip the line at equator and ditch the wait for wreckingball. Put your phone down and go here."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Amazing cold brew👍🏻 Definitely they are using high and good quality coffee beans! :) …
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Jungwon for your kind review! And for your visit!!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"This place makes the BEST cup of coffee! So rich and smooth. I found it through a recommendation on NextDoor... and they did not steer me wrong! It's always a special treat. They use coffees grown, roasted and packed by small farmer cooperatives in Costa Rica. The owner Carlos is really nice too. I highly recommend it!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Hi Deb, thank you for your review!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Beautiful Coffee, even decaf americano will blow your mind!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Cheyone for your kind review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"jody and i were so lucky to stumble across this temple to coffee on our way to the ferry building market. such a delightful experience to meet carlos and his son and experience their passion for great coffee and the people who come into their bodega to drink it. this is what i've always loved the most about san francisco--the artisans who have devoted years to something they care about and perfected it for the delight of everyone else. the care (and careful experimentation) that went into this delicious slightly chocolatey pour-over brew was such a pleasure to discuss and taste. the time it took to make was perfect for a discussion of why the beans don't need to be a week old or less--the cultivation and quality being so much more important. also delicious pastries, indoor and outdoor seating, and the happy contentment of not going food shopping hungry."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Hi Nigel! It was a pleasure to chat with Jody and you; it's always a delight to serve people like you who appreciate our craft and our coffee. Thank you for your kind review, hope you guys a pleasant the rest of your trip."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Not friendly staff, poor quality coffee and food, very uncomfortable experience."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Dorothy, your party was blocking the handicap access pathway and emerging exit route. You were kindly asked to move to another table, but they refused. You then moved to another table, and blocked the pathway even more. The man with you, whom I assume is your husband, was visibly upset, and was violently pushing furniture around. We don’t allow that kind of behavior in our coffee shop, as it’s rude and disturbing to other customers. He later approached the counter and demanded that we fill a cup from another coffee shop with hot water. We told him that we do not do that. He left angry and insulted me.   We stride to create a respectful and peaceful environment in our coffee shop, a refuge from some much rudeness and selfishness. Your party was asked to leave, but you refused. The man with you went on a very aggressive tirade, shouting even more insults. The young woman with you justified his behavior and insults with, and I quote: “Free Speech”. Free Speech does not allow you to insult people. We had to call the police because you would not leave. Everything is well documented.  We have a camera security system that records audio and video exactly for these situations. I’m happy to upload the videos if you feel that things happened differently. "
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Their Reserva pour over is to die for!  Easily best I've had.  Pastries are good if hungry.  But I come back for the coffee
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Love this place. The service is superb - Carlos is super friendly. It's run by a local father/son duo that opened right before the pandemic. Coffee is Costa Rican, which isn't my first choice (I prefer darker roasts), but it's certainly drinkable and one of the less expensive cups you'll find in SF. They have free WiFi and an outdoor seating area, great for popping up and taking a quick call or two. Definitely drop by if you're in the Cow Hollow/Marina area!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Country bar by night and coffee shop by day. The cold brew is strong and flavorful and the iced lattes are incredible! There’s also some cute outdoor seating and pastries if you need a snack. Gotta check this place out!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Great cozy cafe with a fantastic barista. They pull excellent shots here. Definitely the best cappuccino I’ve had in the Bay Area.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Dion for your kind review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Didn’t know what to expect, just looking for coffee and a little breakfast. Carlos kindly asks us what specifically we are looking for in a drink and describes how he can make it so. And he definitely did. I thought this little place wouldn’t have been the best of what I was looking for this morning, but I was quickly proven wrong.  Don’t underestimate this place and the kindness of these people and the lengths they will go to, to fulfill what you are hoping for. The pastries are shockingly very good!!  But overall it was the heart of Carlos and his father that are beautiful. This was more enjoyable than any food or drink. Also seeing the creative work they have been putting into this little cafe is outstanding and worth seeing and chatting with them about.  Come give blessings to these amazing folk and their hard work as they care for their customers and many of the homeless around the area.  Speaking bountiful blessings with Holy Spirit over this place! Thank you Father for them!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you very much Justin for your kind review. We really appreciate that you took the time to write those kind words. You are welcome any time.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Just had my first experience at Coffee Bodega-ordered a pour over and it is amazing! Extremely friendly service, had a really nice conversation with the barista. Love that they get their beans directly from a farm in Costa Rica, can’t wait to go back and try more!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Ashley for your review, it was awsome to have you at our bodeguita!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Came here a couple times during my visit. My family and partner seemed to enjoy the drinks. The lemon poppy seed muffin was incredible. It was so light and not dry at all. Also, I had a Topo Chico water from somewhere else that I thought had a twist cap but actually had a pop cap and I wasn't exactly carrying around a bottle opener and the man at this place was nice enough to open it for me!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Marc thank you for your patronage and review.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Absolutely the best Cortado I've had in San Francisco. Maybe even ever. Carlos, one of the baristas here, is very friendly, and excels at his craft"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you very much Titus for your kind review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Terrible coffee and pastries. Super disappointed! Latte was all milk and lukewarm and pastries were practically inedible.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Great spot serving single origin coffee. This place should be on every coffee affectionados list. Some of the best espresso in San Francisco.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Thank you Roo for your kind review, we really appreciate it!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Tried the mocca, it tasted good and of high quality. The inside is also very nice, it has a clean and sleek atmosphere (I personally love the plants on the wall)."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Alice! We love our plants too!! ;)
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"I searched for coffee in my neighborhood during a short stay in town and went with the highest rated one. But they were closed on Monday, so I settled for tried and true Peet’s nearby. Went back to Peet’s next day and walking home, realized this place was open. Returned to my hotel and for whatever reason I dropped off my latte and went back to Bodega. Maybe because it’s where I originally planned to go? But I justified buying a new coffee by wanting to support small businesses. Their latte was delicious, smooth, and one of the best I’ve had. Savored it and then bought some beans to bring home. The owner was unusually down to earth and enjoyable to talk to.  I’m so glad it worked out that I tried their coffee. I guarantee, I’ll never again visit SF without stopping by Coffee Bodega💕"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Tenia for your kind review. We hope you are fully enjoying time in town. Hope to see you back soon.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Best oat milk latte I’ve had in a while! Lemon poppy muffin was really good, too. They’ve got a few outdoor benches and the bathroom inside is really clean and nice (it also looks like its from Splash Mountain in Disneyland)."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Maya for your review!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Great service & coffee, and the best empanadas."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"This place is a gem and Carlos, who runs it, is an absolute gent. He had the courage to open this coffee shop in the middle of Covid and built a beautiful little wooden patio, perfect for sipping your coffee and reading a book or having a convo. Coffee's top notch. Pastries delicious. Check it out!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,I’ve been coming to Coffee Bodega for several months and I get a consistently great cup of coffee every time. The owner is happy to share his coffee knowledge and takes great pride in the quality of his product.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,They serve an excellent flat white here (which are hard to find in SF!)
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,great coffee and huge appreciation for the sustainable and ethical approach! Carlos is really friendly and the whole place has amazing energy! definitely making this spot my go-to :-)
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Got coffee on a Saturday morning. The barista is awesome and kind. The coffee is delish and goes down without any burnt taste/feeling. Highly recommended! Will be back!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Their espresso is AMAZING! I'm Costa Rican and have worked at multiple well known cafes, such as Peets, Blue Bottle, and Four Barrel. This guy knows what he's doing and you can taste the difference. The hand made wooden fixtures and classic Costa Rican Ox cart out front just add the already charming aesthetic. You're missing out on some delicious coffee and warm customer service if you don't check out this quaint coffee shop in the heart of the Marina."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Thank you Azalia for your kind and amazing review! We are very happy to serve you.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Really great (and strong!) coffee from this cute little shop for a good price. They’re also super friendly and really knowledgable about coffee and the process in general. Definitely a new morning pit stop!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,Great coffee shop in SF downtown!

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,"Heber, you came to the coffee shop on Monday, we are closed on Mondays, as we do deep cleaning and maintaince that day. You were informed of that, and yet you demanded coffee. You stormed out angry beacuse you did not get what you wanted. That is a very entilted and unkind behavior. And on top of that you left a 1-start review!? I have to assume that you were having a bad day. I think that is better if you reconsider your review, this is not helping anyone."
