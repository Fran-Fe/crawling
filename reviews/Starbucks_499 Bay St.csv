Starbucks,"Easily the most elegantly designed Starbucks in SF; Gavin is a superb barista and manager who makes you feel at home; the cafe’s wide open spaciousness , and the street scenery from its floor to ceiling windows relaxes  ; leather chairs are soft that I sink in for hours of reading. Soundtrack is chosen by baristas. Their best deal is the cheese and fruit box; I wish it came with white wine !!!  My quibble with this place is its total lack of central heating; in winter,  come here bundled up."
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,"The most beautiful Starbucks location in San Francisco.  Unfortunately, it's not a Reserve store anymore. Still, it offers standard Starbucks foods and drinks. The interior is beautiful and the all-gender restrooms are always clean-ish. The spacious interior features nice lighting and comfortable seating. There are stools, barstools, chairs, and couches, so you can choose. It's not as nice as it used to be, but still very good. The shelves seem emptier and there are fewer decorations. I recommend checking this Starbucks out, even though it's not a Reserve location anymore."
Starbucks,"I am not sure what happened to my location review but the Starbucks on Main Street between Mission and Howard Street is a great place for a coffee and meeting. Unlike many other locations, there are plenty of tables and chairs available. The Baristas and front counter service are very friendly. The service has always been consistently superior. One of my favorite Starbucks in downtown SF.-By the way, the Salesforce transit center is one block walking distance."
Starbucks,Hi there! We're so glad you had a wonderful experience. Thanks for sharing it with us!
Starbucks,"Yes, this is a pretty place, but it can also be a little confusing. I was here on 3/1 at 5:45p & they're open till 6:30. When I entered from Mission, there was a puddle from a spilled drink in front of the trash cans inside the door. After I figured out where to order/the registers actually were, I stood in line for almost 5 minutes even though I was the only one ordering because there seemed to be only 1 employee. Then a 2nd person came out of the back to take my order. As I waited another 5 minutes for my cup of tea, a 3rd person was sweeping (not with a mop or anything to clean up the wet spill) AROUND the puddle. I know it was ""closing,"" but you still have customers and 45 minutes to go. I've gladly waited in line at smaller stores because it's busy & almost always had a better customer experience than at this place when it was practically empty. I'll make sure I leave work early enough to catch my favorite crew @1st&Mission if I ever need an after-work fulfillment from now on."

Starbucks,"The store is very spacious and it’s a great place to hangout with friends or quietly work. The staff is very friendly and helpful, they patiently introduced different options for us. They serve coffee samplers for both cold brew and hot coffee which are great for group tasting. Cold brew float is my favorite, it is a great combination between cold brew coffee and ice cream."
Starbucks,"Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff. Have never had a bad experience here! One of the most beautiful Starbucks I've been to as well."
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,They make good drinks but for some reason they don't announce your name nor put the drinks on the counter for mobile orders. I've waited multiple times and even given my name and still wasn't told when it was ready. They're also super slow in making drinks. The  other Starbucks in the neighborhood are much faster and better organized.
Starbucks,"A nice enjoyable place. Good decoration. Tried its Rwanda Abakundakawa brew and spiced ginger cold brew, both are nice. Rwanda one is quite heavily roasted, good for one prefer strong taste. Spiced ginger like a ginger ale. 4.5 stars 😊 …"
Starbucks,"This was my first visit to a Starbucks Reserve location and it exceeded expectations. Starbucks does well to imitate a ""higher-end"" experience in all of their stores, but the Reserve brings high-end experience to the drinks as well. The counter is two sided, one where you can order classic Starbucks drinks and the Reserve side with more ""craft"" menu items.  The atmosphere is chill and the employees seem to enjoy their jobs.  The restrooms were also quite notable."
Starbucks,"First time at Starbucks Reserve. Nice music, environment, and fantastic service.  WARNING: Some of their drinks contain dairy even though the menu doesn’t say so. Menumat day foam, like cascara foam, and one just thinks it’s from the nitro, but it’s actually milk 😝.  I had to throw out my nitro coffee because I discovered after the fact that it had dairy and brewmaster didn’t offer to replace drink 🙁"
Starbucks,"Wow! Starbucks Staff is very nice, and the place is very welcoming. I enjoy coming here during my stay in San Francisco."
Starbucks,"Great svc very attentive staff. Very nice location. The interior décor look warm and pleasant. Menu recommend ""coffee affogato"""
Starbucks,"Good service, quality food, staff meet my expectations, just the coffee bags are behind the counter (normally on shelf), which is minor."
Starbucks,"Awesome place! This Starbucks Reserve location is modern, trendy, and just a cool place. It’s built for crowds. Currently you can get some great one on one service. The staff immediately welcomed me when I entered. The staff were knowledgeable about the drinks and the type of cold brew offered.  I tried the Hazelnut Bianco Latte. It was creamy and slightly sweet, with a subtle hazelnut undertone.  The reserve store has a selection of specialty drinks, cold brew drinks, hot teas, brewed coffee, etc. You could get a normal Starbucks drink, but why would you when you can try something special. The food menu is the traditional offerings.  I can’t wait to return to try something new."
Starbucks,"Thank you to all the friendly baristas here! And thank you to my barista Monika for being SUPER friendly.  Edit: I only listed ONE barista, there is too many baristas at that one location to list  2nd Edit: The pic below was my free Dark Chocolate Mocha to celebrate my birthday  3rd Edit: Ignore the review by Jn Systems, he just wants too much berries with his drink. That's why there is the 12 per add-in limit."
Starbucks,"whoever the girl is  wearing all the pungent perfume on her body and touching the cups. It doesn't smell good when I'm drinking my coffee also, I no for a fact that you're not supposed to wear any perfume or cologne at Starbucks, one of my family members is a manager for one of the Starbucks told me that they're not allowed to wear any perfume or cologne.."
Starbucks,"Hello, I'm sorry to hear about this but appreciate you for sharing your experience. If you'd like additional assistance from our team, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs)!"
Starbucks,Nice spot to grab a comfy chair and curl up with a warm beverage. The Reserve side has some of your favorite drinks with a bit more polish. I’m partial to the espresso with a side of sparkling water at the bar. It’s a nice quick respite from the work day. They also seem to be a bit friendlier than normal here. ☕️
Starbucks,"Tremendous great thanks, for the staff late in the afternoon, this date, that captured my wayward lost backpack.!"
Starbucks,Hi there! We're so glad you had a wonderful experience. Thanks for sharing it with us!
Starbucks,"The best coffee ever! We got the melrose, it’s tasty with cherry flavor, the cold brew is great!"
Starbucks,Good service with special reserve coffees but the thing is there are no outlets for my laptop :( Wifi was very slow.
Starbucks,"Great special drinks, nice environment! Love it~"
Starbucks,I tried the Galapagos Reserve. So good and that is having it black.
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,Awesome Starbucks! Super spacious and the biggest selection of drink options and coffee gewgaws. Great seating options too.
Starbucks,"Well I know a lot abt Starbucks now, my hubby manages 1. Nothing but nice things"
Starbucks,Great.  Love these places.  Unlimited cold brew coffee.  Yum muffins.  Star Bucks has stepped up their game over the years and the Reserves are great
Starbucks,The nicest Starbucks I’ve ever been to. Also the employees were so so nice!
Starbucks,"All Starbucks locations will mess up an order on occasion, but this is the only location that I've been to that recovers from it so well. Whenever I go to this location, they always go above and beyond to make sure your order is right and if it isn't, they do what they can to make it right. I'm not the type of person to ask for something to be fixed or complain when something is taking a while. All the baristas are so kind and take the initiative to make sure you have the best customer experience possible."
Starbucks,"The people who work here are so friendly and really hard working, constant go go go. I appreciate being here and the drinks taste delicious (I know they are standardized, but they are well made here with a particular attention and care and it makes a big difference). Thank you for establishing a lovely space under the umbrella of a large corporation. Beautiful space too, with bird of paradise flowers, gorgeous and aesthetically pleasing wood and other materials, and lots of light :)"
Starbucks,"20% foam, 70% ice ( for light ice? ), so I paid 5 bucks getting 10% juice of a venti cup. I guess next time, it must be “no ice” huh?"
Starbucks,"Honestly I love this Starbucks. Large and roomy, bright and open, and the drinks hit the spot."
Starbucks,"Good service. I almost hate it because it's right across the street from work, so guess where I'm at during my lunch breaks. Womp womp.  Reserve status aside, it's a nice not-so-little Starbucks. It's a bit dark inside (probably because it's a Reserve), and the overall mood is a bit more mellow (also probably because it's a Reserve). You'll get the same friendly service and good coffee expected from any Starbucks, but with more room to wander around (because #Reserve). You almost don't notice the laptop folks that need to work at a coffee shop with all that room. Seriously- it's unnecessarily big in here) and all that darkness (the paint pallette, not feeling) just adds to the darkness (the feeling). Thank goodness for the awesome cheery staff, caffeine, and sugar to offset the #Reserve.  One positive of the #Reserve are the affogatos- a must-try during the summer (or winter, I judge). I've tried some of the popular Reserve menu items, but this one is really the only item that's extraordinary. It's espresso floats. C'mon- that's so extra right? I've found the Reserve lattes a bit milk forward than I'd like, so probably ease up on milk when ordering or otherwise, your drinks will just taste and look like flavored milk on Instagram you silly kids."
Starbucks,"The first time I came in this Starbucks was bustling, but that did not sour my experience at all. The line (though long) moved fast and soon enough I had my drink in hand, and to make things even nicer, I had a personable 'hello' and 'have a nice day' along with the barista's and their warm smiles, this all happening even amidst the some 50 other patrons (of whom some were a bit noisy and rude) who were crowding the reserve-bar area. Amidst this craziness, the staff at this wonderful Starbucks still had strong and kind spirits about them.  I came a second time a few days later with my dad around 3 pm on a saturday, and there were some 10 other people there; it was quaint, quiet, and so very enjoyable. Our food and drinks came so quickly and again those beaming smiles and nice exchange of words made me feel like I could've stayed there for several hours; my dad and I stayed there for an hour and had the most enjoyable time, if that says anything.  To top it all off, this Starbucks actually plays soothing jazz, something I personally find scarce in the many Starbucks I go to nowadays in North America. I must say, I feel as though this was the best and most enjoyable Starbucks atmosphere I've ever experienced ever :)"
Starbucks,"Best Starbucks in DT San Francisco by far. Great service, great excellent employees who make coffees perfect better than almost every other coffee store in downtown San Francisco. I can't recommend this place more if you want Starbucks or if you want coffee. Lots of space to work and the bathrooms are usually very clean."
Starbucks,"Really nice atmosphere. It has the space and the social aspect of a classy neighborhood bar without alcohol. Not that I don't like alcohol as much as the next guy, but when you're sitting together discussing business it's refreshing to know that no one in your party is being influenced by alcohol."
Starbucks,Hands down the best Starbucks I been to in the city. I love the set up and I love how they honor when they make a mistake. A person came in and took my drink before I got to the counter. The young lady immediately apologized and made another one on top of a complementary card due to the mistake. I love this place not because of the replacement but because of there energy and enthusiasm. 😍😍
Starbucks,"Excellent interior and service, coffee. However I removed 1 star for the lack of electronic tipping: most people don’t carry cash these days, please be fair to your baristas as I expect they receive little tipping as a result. I recommend adding flip screens with % tip to give if paying with credit card."
Starbucks,"Wow. What an experience to enjoy. I'm not normally a Starbucks fan but this place is a treat. You can get your normal Starbucks or enjoy the ambiance of an Italian coffee bar. They have traditional pour overs, clover, French press, you name it and they'll do it. They will bring your coffee out to you to enjoy. Definitely recommend this place if you have some free time and are not in a rush for a caffeine fix."
Starbucks,"Starbucks reserve on Mission Street is big and feels classy. They have taken the coffee shop to a new level. You will find all kinds of new drinks, variations on the coffee theme  that, frankly, I haven't tried, but only because I'm a creature of habit. I did have a flat white once, in a ceramic cup no less, allowing myself the luxury of sipping it at one of the outdoor tables instead of getting a tall fresh brewed to go and rushing back to my beloved cubicle. This location is very close to where I work so that's a draw for me. But it's also on the northern edge of the up and coming south of Mission Street area between Spear Street and First Street, roughly. Many new, sleek high rises, some of which combine business/residential, are under construction or already occupied in this zone. This neighborhood is being transformed into a place of beauty and seems clean and safer than it used to be. So this Starbucks location is part of the Renaissance of this area so it fits in well with the overall changing scene south of it."
Starbucks,Been there thrice in 3 locations. Hit and miss. I loved their whiskey barrel cold brew and their move way from single use cups while keeping prices sustainable. But at the time of this review it the menu seemed confusing along with exectuon of concierge experience which I think is a goal
Starbucks,"The R at the reserve bar stands for reward!!! I use my Starbucks rewards here to try the drinks that are only made at the R bar. I love the cold brew malt, the cold brew ginger beer drink needs to grow on me. I’ll try the Manhattan themed drink next. Overall I like the space plenty of room and multiple drink bars. If your a fan of Starbucks do yourself a favor and try something different."
Starbucks,Though starbucks often has a reputation as the generic coffee shop this one stands apart from that standard.  It has coffee that is of the same quality as any other third wave cafe.  Paired with the wonderful interior it's an excellent place for a good cup of coffee.
Starbucks,"Ridiculously delicious coffee. Starbucks has done it right; attention to detail is paramount at the Reserve locations. You options are limitless; from regular lattes, cold brew, nitro, pour overs and syphon experience. They carry a lot better better varietals of beans and  roasts than your run of the mill Starbucks!"
Starbucks,"We had such a wonderful barista, Roxy, who let us take a time-lapse/videos of her making the coffee and explaining it. She made us feel very welcome and we had a great, comfortable time here drinking some incredible coffee."
Starbucks,"Awesome coffee - really a marked improvement over the standard Starbucks blends, which I don't actually like much. I've been coming here for over a year and the staff is always so kind and helpful too, even when they're backed up on orders."
Starbucks,"Beautiful, modern, and very open interior using wood and metal. Lots of seating available to sit and sip or work at. When you enter, you're greeted with a large black board, one side showing the reserve coffees and the other side, where the register is, the usual Starbucks coffee. You can also still pick up some food. Also, if there is a line, there are paper menus showing both reserve and usual Sbux coffee."
Starbucks,Love Reserve. Same great coffees plus so much more... I had a dark chocolate mocha espresso and was delicious. Bathrooms are awesome too
Starbucks,"I got some yogurts but they were expired and they didn’t care at all. Also, just one person preparing the orders and took me a long time just for one chai tea latte!"
Starbucks,I had the best white chocolate peppermint mocha I've ever had here.
Starbucks,"Easy in and easy out.  Pretty fast service.  On occasions you will find a line for service,  but staff is friendly and fast."
Starbucks,"Too too large! Not warm and inviting. More like a coffee warehouse! Very little ""off in the corner areas"" to quietly  relax and converse. Son in law and I did experiment to taste test the difference between the new ""Siphon system"" coffee versus a Chemex preparation using the same coffee beans for both. Chemex was preferred by us both, hands down."
Starbucks,Slow service and no bathroom. Friendly workers have earned it 3 stars. Otherwise I'd be inclined to give two. It's a franchise. Compared to other locations it fell below the standard.
Starbucks,Love the affogatos here. Usually it can take 10 to 15 minutes for your order but well worth the wait for the drinks here. Quality is a huge step up compared to a standard Starbucks.
Starbucks,Beautiful interiors and coffee that's not burnt. The reserve menu is something to try at least once! You can have your coffee made a variety of different ways.
Starbucks,"Amazing service! I get off the bus, from a block away, every morning, and I submit my mobile order right before I get off the bus, and after a 1-2 minute walk, my drink is ready! Very friendly and professional staff!"
Starbucks,Beautifully sized and designed Starbucks.  Much larger than many Starbucks'.
Starbucks,Good place to chill. Employees love their job. The breakfast chicken sandwich is the bomb. I have locations closer to my home but I will come here.
Starbucks,This was my first time at a reserve and it was awesome there's was a awesome and eclectic selection. The staff were all great and friendly. The onlt sad part is that there aren't more reserves out there.
Starbucks,"The only reserve store in the city is well stocked with exactly what you expect of a fancier starbucks. Their reserve coffees as well as speciality mochas and cold brews are definitely worth the trip. Plus, theiris table service, a rarity for a starbucks store. The gender neutral restrooms are a good touch, representative of a modern san francisco, but some might think it's a step too far. No specialty food items whoch is a bit of a bummer, but all coffee and even their pourover equipment is for sale"
Starbucks,Love it here. They make what u ask for right
Starbucks,Large shop with many Reserve coffee drinks not served at other places. Plenty of seatings for small groups. Usually crowded during morning and lunch rush hours.
Starbucks,"I love this place, a blessed, gorgeous place with a bunch of very nice staffs! Thank you all !"
Starbucks,"Sleek interiors, friendly staff, expansive menu, and great affogatos!"
Starbucks,"Great coffee, Unlike normal Starbucks the reserve has specialized  brewing techniques  that really take some of the coffee up a notch."
Starbucks,Fantastic service and great spot to lounge on a sunny afternoon with their affogato (espresso over ice cream) 😎 …
Starbucks,Definitely the only Starbucks that has extremely comfortable chairs AND baristas that actually know how to make creamy latte foam.
Starbucks,Great staff works fast very pleasant to be around
Starbucks,A good experience.  My first time. It didn't cost any more than normal. Very spacious
Starbucks,These reserve places are just so swanky. This spot is huge ! Plenty of seating and a nice group of baristas.
Starbucks,My friends and I enjoyed it here. We came twice in one day! The Afagotto is so good.
Starbucks,"I get coffee here every week almost everyday. Great staff, keep up the great work! :)"
Starbucks,The only place to get your nitro cold brew as the other Starbucks in the area don't have their equipment calibrated correctly.
Starbucks,One of a kind coffee place in the city where you get to have different coffee experiences including the siphon one which is my favorite
Starbucks,"Decent coffee and MANY outlets hidden away under the lip of the benches and high up under the tall tables, just have to look closely."
Starbucks,They are always nice people that are working hard
Starbucks,Slow WiFi. This is SF. Fix it. Dropping this down to 1 star. The app put me in another place and I ordered and went to pick up my drink. The lady working talked down to me and scolded me because of this.
Starbucks,Great Place! Roomy! Went there with my team at work just to have a small meeting.
Starbucks,"Great appearance, sadly I dont drink much coffee, so Im not able to comment on its coffe"
Starbucks,It’s different then normal Starbucks stores. Plenty of seating available. Try reserve specials latte.
Starbucks,Favorite excuse for an afternoon walk; it's a beautiful place that feels zen and is full of lovely people.

Starbucks,Seriously and surprisingly worth a visit. Get the fanciest coffee you can.
Starbucks,Very impressive.  They even serve affogato!   A lot more than what you would find at Philz.
Starbucks,Rated R coffee ;)
Starbucks,"Usually friendly people but major attitude this morning. I started my order and was immediately interrupted with what size?? Then name?? Barista didn't even call out my name and let alone my drink was wrong. I ordered nonfat no whip I got 2% with whip. I told the barista who told me ""that's not what was written"" sorry.. I don't write my own cup.. Remade and tastes good. Experience is so so and I'll go to one of the many other coffee shops next time!"
Starbucks,One of the few Starbucks that serve affogatos. Go with house affogato if you like cinnamon otherwise classic affogato.
Starbucks,Good sbux location; Reserve drinks take longer than the usual formulas
Starbucks,Place only open for mobile orders today.
Starbucks,"Great new kinds of coffee!! The interior is excellent, fresh, new and clean!!"

Starbucks,"It's a nice shop Great place to recharge yourself, and your phone"
Starbucks,"Everyone here is top notch! Polite, complimentary and communicative. Love it!"
Starbucks,"Great Starbucks, they make a point of learning regular's names and orders."
Starbucks,One of the larger Starbuck venues around SF. Large amount of seating space and very clean environment

Starbucks,"No power outlets, any starbucks with zero power outlets gets a one star"

Starbucks,"There are many Starbucks Reserve stores in Seoul, Korea. But it was surprising that there was only one in San Francisco. The spacious store and luxurious interior are the same as in Korea. However, the price of coffee is much cheaper than in Korea! Jamaican Blue Mountain is sold for 12,000 won in Korea, but in the US, it was 5,500 won. Starbucks products are tailored to American culture. so i wanted to buy it. I bought eco bags, play cards, and mugs. The table had user-friendly features. There was a bag hook to hang the bag on. It is highly appreciated that there are several options such as high tables and low tables. It opened at 5 a.m. and welcomed people who worked earlier than any other coffee shop. On the last day of leaving San Francisco, I was also happy to have a cup of coffee and leave thanks to the Starbucks Reserve store that opened early in the morning."
Starbucks,"English Spanish If you are a tourist you need to visit this place, sell souvenirs, starbucks classics and have a bakery. however the bathrooms are mixed If you are a tourist you need to visit this place, they sell souvenirs, the Starbucks classics and they have a bakery. however the bathrooms are mixed"
