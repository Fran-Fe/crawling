Mazarine Coffee,"Such a cute little spot! Visiting from out of town and loved it! Fig and Ricotta Toast, Avocado Toast, Pour Over Green Tea, Cappuccino with Almond Milk All amazing delicious!"
Mazarine Coffee,Service was friendly. Coffee and food good. Mocha especially excellent. Prices on the high side but good quality.
Mazarine Coffee,Coffee and service was good here. We came here as it looked like they had great reviews and they opened early. Great nitro and grilled bacon sandwich pictured.
Mazarine Coffee,"Excellent coffee and nice people, the avocado toast was good too and the club sandwich was one of the best I’ve EVER had!"
Mazarine Coffee,$5.75 nitro cold brew $6.5 iced latte $11.5 fresh fruits and ricotta Free wifi  The fresh fruit and ricotta toast was interesting with sea salt and black pepper on it. Friendly staff and good service :)
Mazarine Coffee,"Absolutely delicious coffee and food. Great presentation and atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Coffee was high quality, roasted very well, there was no bitterness."
Mazarine Coffee,"Loved the beet hummus!  Wish there was drip decaf coffee, but they make me a great decaf americano instead!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Definitely my kind of coffee shop!! This was BEST TOAST I’ve ever had in a long time! The tomato, ricotta and basil toast was amazing. I was basic and ordered a vanilla latte but man it was still so good 😫 …"
Mazarine Coffee,"I have been to San Francisco twice since 2019 and have always tried to make at least one visit to have their amazing breakfast toasts. This time I had a ham, egg and cheese toast with an oat milk latte. And I was not let down: fresh bread and a terrific balance of flavors. Even the latte was amazing! Whatever espresso they use went well with the smooth, oat milk. Definitely worth a visit. If you are an early riser, even better and sit outside."
Mazarine Coffee,"Been coming to Mazarine for coffee, weekly, for a few years now and it never disappoints.  The baristas are very precise (they measure everything) to make sure the coffee comes out perfectly each time. The level of care they put into each drink makes this one of the most consistently good coffeeshops in SF. It’s also located in a great location, in the heart of the city. I strongly recommend the cortado 🙌🏽"
Mazarine Coffee,"Great location, amazing service, and high-quality food and coffee. I appreciate the attention they pay to crafting their coffee beverages. Nothing worse that bad tasting coffee. Mazarine does a great job at making delicious coffee.  The food is a little pricy, but what you get tastes great, so it’s a small downside."
Mazarine Coffee,"In town for a conference, I was looking for a lowkey place to work, ideally that had decent coffee, but mostly that was not super crowded and had a good vibe. Here you get both! Really was surprised to even find a laid back coffee shop that had space to work in such a bustling city. Wish they had more outlets, but not charging my computer was my b anyway. Recommend!"
Mazarine Coffee,One of my go to places on Market street for great coffee and breakfast. If you are after something to eat I definitely recommend the avocado sandwich.
Mazarine Coffee,Coffee is good but a bit overpriced. Music was a little too loud.
Mazarine Coffee,Nice spot for a quick stop. Warm and clean space with tables inside and out. Tasty and high quality food but small portions. Coffe and mocha were not good at all. Not friendly/polite staff. They can do much better.
Mazarine Coffee,"Lovely place, great coffee and toasts!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Pretty solid espresso: good taste and a medium roast. With great food. Atmosphere is pretty busy, very finance district, may need to eat standing."
Mazarine Coffee,toasts were amazing! lots of room to sit inside.
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice, warm & welcoming coffee shop that is open early for early birds who can't live without breakfast. The matcha was rich & creamy, full of flavor, the way I like it. The cappuccino was also good. The avocado toast, grilled cheese,  croissant & other pastries were all satisfying."
Mazarine Coffee,One of the best places in San Francisco for Avocado Toasts! Cozy in- and outdoor seating. Coffee is super delicious. Definitely try the homemade salted grapefruit lemonade!  Suggestion: Add some tomatoes to the avocado toast - super yummy!
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee. They had an amazing fig jam and ricotta toast
Mazarine Coffee,"The queue out of the door says all you need to know. Great coffee (espresso), choice of milks including oat. I had the avocado and beet hummus on toast, well presented and tasted very fresh.Even though it can be a jostle for tables there seems to be a steady flow. If their are two of you, send one person to grab a table while the other orders."
Mazarine Coffee,Good coffee. We had coffee and my wife ordered the overnight oats for breakfast. Fast service and everything looked nice. Toasts and sandwiches also looked good
Mazarine Coffee,"Couple of good vegan options, and they were happy to make my beetroot hummus toast without the cheese. Coffee is awesome, the pour over is especially good. Friendly staff, order and pay at the counter, nab a seat when you can, then they’ll call your name to go up and pick up your order.  It’s appreciated when you take your plates and mugs back up to the countertop after you finish."
Mazarine Coffee,"We visited the place on Friday morning and it was pretty busy but the line was going quick. We ordered a latte, a Golden Yunnan tea, an egg & avocado toast and a country breakfast. Gluten free toast is available as well. Everything was very flavorful and fresh. They also have seating outside if anyone wants."
Mazarine Coffee,Dark roast only. Highly skilled barrister though.
Mazarine Coffee,I tried fig and ricotta and this is my first time trying this combination and I really like it. my friend ordered hummus & avocado. The place is okay but I would come for the toasts 😋
Mazarine Coffee,I'm a sucker for good coffee place. They have great coffee selection and veriety. From special blends to balance the taste to single origins to get that full of flavor sip and contemplate the scenery and imagination of the country that grows these beans. Their avocado taste is nice however I didn't like it because it wasn't purely an avocado toast.
Mazarine Coffee,Excellent food. The avocado on toast was yum. Service was fast and there is plenty of space to sit. Clean bathrooms...they have a book wallpaper which was fun to look at. The drip coffee wasn't too good though.
Mazarine Coffee,"So you woke up in SanFran.. and want a chic cafe to start your morning with really high grade coffee and breakfast food and pastries. This is when you head over to Mazarine, easy walking distance from most downtown hotels. Fantastic menu and smooth coffee choices. Simple, comfortable atmosphere... great people watching as locals come and go at the start of their day. Had the Gibraltar for coffee and the fig + ricotta toast.. it was a flavor fest in my mouth. Definitely will be recreating it at home. No Wifi.. debate-able whether that’s a good thing or not. In any case, would not deter me to go back and try some of the other foods people around me were having.. egg toasts, fresh croissants, something with yummy salmon in it.. let’s say my eyes were eating it all up!  Start your day right! start your day with a positive thought or image.. and yes good coffee does help!"
Mazarine Coffee,Pricing on the higher scale but good atmosphere and extensive toast menu. And the sous vide egg was on point. Grilled cheese seems to be a popular option too. The store can get busy later in the day.
Mazarine Coffee,This place is gorgeous inside and has nice outside seating. It’s on Market st. which is truly disgusting but they keep the outside clean so it’s not so bad. Sit inside in the back to work/study or in front for sunny window seating. I got the salmon toast and an Arnold Palmer. Both delicious. The toast is really filling and mostly healthy.
Mazarine Coffee,"If you're a coffee enthusiast, you have to check out this shop. They serve some of the best pour-over coffee I've ever tasted, and their knowledge and passion for coffee is evident in every cup."
Mazarine Coffee,More fast casual then dine in breakfast. Toast and over nights are nothing to write home about. But the ingredients  are fresh and good for a quick bite if your around!
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice outdoor seating if you like to see people walking outside. Smaller portion than normal. More coffee options to choose from, but wasn't that amazed by my pour over coffee."
Mazarine Coffee,"Awesome coffee place, very busy and the code is quite expensive. But it you get a place to sit it's quite good. Very close to public transit and right at the heart of market! Tons of power outlets, fun place to work remotely on your laptop or for reading a book. Not too quiet, not too noisy."
Mazarine Coffee,Their Gibraltar is a must must try. It's like a cortado but less on the intense/bitter side.
Mazarine Coffee,I got to this coffee place after looking for a third wave coffee place. I love the fact it does not part of a coffee chain. The cold brew coffee is one of the best I tasted. The food is also vert good. Two thing to take in consideration are long queue during coffee “rush hours” and the limited sitting. Will  defiantly come again
Mazarine Coffee,"My colleague spent $26 for a hot tea and a chicken salad that contained barely any chicken. Overall ok spot (lots of seating) and priciness is to be expected for the location (and my $15 ham and egg toast was tasty at least), but the salad should have more than a few pieces of chicken at that price point."
Mazarine Coffee,We came here almost every day of our trip.  This place is excellent and has great food as well. Well worth the but if a wait to get your handcrafted coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,"Not bad! I did think the food options were overpriced but the drinks are pretty standard. I had a latte and the pain au ciocolate (chocolate croissant). Both were decent, but nothing special. The cashier did not offer to warm the croissant so it was tough and tasted a bit stale. The latte was silky and creamy and the coffee taste was mild. Not bitter at all, even without any added sugar, and it came in a huge bowl-like mug which I really liked! There is NO wifi, and the #SFWiFi did not work at this cafe, so I had to gulp down my massive latte and leave quickly so I could find a place to work. Overall it is a quaint cafe with good seating and ambiance. Most folks sitting in were conversing in pairs. It seems like a great place for a coffee date or informal meeting!"
Mazarine Coffee,"After going to as many coffee shops as I can find, this one takes the top spot. The baristas are on point here, serving up quality and precision brewed coffee while maintaining friendly service. The espresso is hands down the best and is very consistent in quality."
Mazarine Coffee,"The place is really noce and cozy, the staff are friendly and the food is amazing i had the beet hummus, Avocado and Ricotta cheese toast it was so yummy.Also the vanilla Latte they make is very special❤️❤️"
Mazarine Coffee,Nice little coffee shop.  I only ordered an espresso to go.  It is very smooth.
Mazarine Coffee,"Outstanding. Drinks were spot on and I came back here more than once while here for a conference. Toast was delicious, albeit a bit pricey, but hey, it’s San Fransisco. A good thing going here, and the daily line to the counter proved it."
Mazarine Coffee,"I came here for brunch and it was exactly what I wanted. The avocado and egg toast was fantastic with the sous vide eggs perfectly cooked so that it's not completely cooked but also not runny. I got an iced hot chocolate (requested), and it was equally refreshing and tasty. It does get crowded so I got mine to-go just in case, but their for-here dinnerware is simple and fitting for a down to earth meal :)"
Mazarine Coffee,"Came in for a quick takeout coffee. The layout of the coffee shop was pretty confusing, wasn’t sure where to stand in line to order. Staff were ok, but quite disoriented and not in the “morning rush” mode. I was the only one in line and it took 10 min to get my cup. There were no cardboard holders so I had to bunch up napkins to prevent burning my fingertips. The coffee quality was 4 star, creamy organic milk, but one star off for lacking the richness of the roast. Didn’t really have that fragrance of strong coffee. Food coming out looked quite good, thick toast and eggs."
Mazarine Coffee,"Good coffee. Yummy breakfast! Def try the avocado toast, eggs & avocado toast and the tomato ricotta boil toast ! Def going back there on visiting sfo."
Mazarine Coffee,Cute little coffee shop on market street.  I would highly recommend their lox toast and latte. You can even get it on gluten free bread for an extra 1.50.  Gets a bit busy in the morning so snag a seat after you order. The drinks and food comes out fairly quickly.
Mazarine Coffee,"Had a delicious latte and healthy, tasty lentil and avocado bowl in the sunshine on their little patio. Delightful!"
Mazarine Coffee,Cosy place with great coffee and good variety of toasts. Good place to just sit and chill for a while. Thought I’d still be hungry after one toast but it was actually just nice.
Mazarine Coffee,Have to stop by Mazarine if I'm in the area. Very creative breakfast items and good staff.  Gets my vote for best avocado toast and introduced me to watermelon radishes.  Small space so sometimes seats are tough to find but sometimes nice to linger on smallish patio overlooking Market St. sea of humanity.
Mazarine Coffee,Brian is my FAVE! Coffee? Incredible! Avocado toast? Phenomenal!! I love...EVERYTHING!! This place ROCKS!!!
Mazarine Coffee,"Going in for a quick bite and coffee, I was pleasantly surprised. Light fare - a variety of delicious toast and vegetarian options. Good espresso with beautiful latte art. You’ll be amazed."
Mazarine Coffee,"Loved this gem of a place! Great coffee and excellent food, located in a great area!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Quite expensive but undoubtedly good quality. I ordered the Egg & Avocado toast for $11, egg was pretty runny but definitely very tasty."
Mazarine Coffee,"Tomato toast was quite delicious, wouldn't recommend the beetroot hummus. People talk about the toast but it seems expensive and not very filling. Had a sparkling cucumber limeade that was very refreshing. Coffee is ok, wouldn't line up for it. Had to bus own table."
Mazarine Coffee,Ordered a latte and the avo toast. Coffee was too hot it almost burned my tongue. So disappointed as I read many great reviews about this cafe so at least I though that they’d be able to make the coffee right.
Mazarine Coffee,"Colorful dishes and friendly staff, really good place for overall review however I have some comments. I prefer avocado in small cuts to put on top of whole sandwich not big like this. The coffee is ok and nothing special."
Mazarine Coffee,Food is very expensive and ok. Coffee and ambience is good.
Mazarine Coffee,"Beet hummus toast was so yummy! was coffee too! Fyi, There is no wifi here and I expected beautiful latte art tho.. but it’ fine. I’ll come back to try other menus"
Mazarine Coffee,"Best coffee and absolutely love the bread they use for their toasts. Light meals, not too heavy."
Mazarine Coffee,"my new fav place for coffee and toast and i meant good drip coffee and scrumptious toast even they scream CALORIESSSSS. but seriously, the baristas are very serious about their coffee craft"
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice ambience. Great coffee. Tried their waffle recently, was good. The expresso is decently flavored. Been going to this place for a few months. Would recommend at least a visit for coffee. Also try some of the food."
Mazarine Coffee,"People say you can’t get food coffee in the states.. where are they going? Starbucks?  This place does a solid flat white (with soy for any of you aussies) and a delicious selection of eats and pastries to go with. I had the beatroot, hummus, avo and what I think was hard ricotta. Yum all the way to the bay."
Mazarine Coffee,"Great lunch spot! Both the salads and the sandwiches were fresh, tasty, and well made. The coffee is excellent too."
Mazarine Coffee,"Very kind staff here. I came on a Friday afternoon and needed to charge my phone. This coffee shop although in a hectic location is rather peaceful! It is great for working or reading. I ordered a hot chocolate which was pretty much the price of a latte and it was delicious, not too sweet or overwhelmingly chocolatey. They even made it with almond milk."
Mazarine Coffee,"On my short trip to San Francisco I came here twice right before work. They're coffee is pretty good and I got a cold brew at the next time I got a chai latte I definitely prefer the cold brew a little bit more than the chai latte.  I also got a plain croissant, which I thought was OK, but nothing special. This place is definitely a great spot to get your daily coffee fix and maybe a piece for yourself. However, I don't think it is a place worth planning around on a café/bakery tour  Alice C.Elite 2022 San Francisco, CA 431490603 11/6/2022 4 check-ins While it seems to be on the pricey side ($6 for an espresso at least!), Mazarine is a great alternative to the ubiquitous Blue Bottle coffee that you find all over the city. The coffee (espresso) is delicious, the baristas are very friendly, and on top of that, they actually have a full menu of toasts and other savory items so you can get breakfast or lunch here easily.  On the price again: it seems steep but to be absolutely honest, it is comparable to their main competitors like Blue Bottle or Caffe Central. Toast at $12 a piece is actually quite average around the Bay Area and I've even seen those prices in the Midwest... so don't let that stop you. Just understand that everything is expensive now.  Mazarine is quite close to Moscone center, which makes it a great place to stop by before your conferences. But it also can get slammed at certain times in the day -- or when one of the aforementioned conferences is happening. Just be prepared, or order online ahead of time, and if they are too busy, there's always the Blue Bottle down the street.  Meryl S.Elite 2022 Parkside, San Francisco, CA 2372839 9/16/2022 1 photo This is place is such a great spot to get some work done! It has wi-fi sand outlets and lots of tables to sit at. At times it can get very loud so bring some headphones if you are trying to concentrate.  The food here was really good and came in a timely manner! The drinks here are good but nothing too special! Definitely you can tell the baristas are making the espresso right!  I would say overall this a great place but the person who was taking my order seemed annoyed and wanted to rush me.  Ham, Egg, & Cheese Toast Chicken Club  Hannah P.Elite 2022 Raleigh, NC 29246571 10/23/2022 1 photo1 check-in Very large and spacious breakfast spot! Tons of food options with toasts both sweet and savory. I opted for the avocado toast which was very unique and unlike any I'd had. I enjoyed it but found the bread to be very crusty and a bit difficult to eat. I also got a chai latte that was both beautiful to look at and tasted amazing. One of the better chais I've had lately! I'd definitely return here to try a different toast.  Avocado Toast and Chai Latte"
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious food and good ambient, friendly staff. One bad think: They don't accept $50 notes. Recommended!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious drip coffee, smooth and balanced. I would highly recommend Mazarine Coffee. The food is good as well, I ordered avocado toast with egg, and it was well done with fresh ingredients. Also had other dishes and all were very good. Much appreciated the terracotta dishes and being served my coffee in real mugs."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee. The Yogurt and oatmeal are very good.
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee, we finally found a perfect flat white and cappuccino in SF. The place also has a great vibe, glad we passed by!"
Mazarine Coffee,Enjoyed the Gilbraltar Espresso. Wasn't the delicious nor distinct. The place was impressively calm and quiet. The service was smiley and easy going. The place is quite unusual for its cleanliness and elegance for its location on the urine-soaked Market Street
Mazarine Coffee,"Good food and drink. Little pricey for what you get, but not unreasonable for the city. No wifi available, which is odd given it's a coffee shop and really ought to have wifi. I had the tomato/basil to sit and chia seed with lemonade... very tasty!"
Mazarine Coffee,Nice Americano and avocado toast
Mazarine Coffee,Lovely coffee shop. A bit tight and crowded to work from here but they have great coffee and a nice menu. Several toast / bunch options available. I enjoyed everything I had.
Mazarine Coffee,A great place to stop for coffee and light food. The food is fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is nice and the stuff are friendly. Highly Recommended.
Mazarine Coffee,"Fig toast, Tomato&basil toast and Raf  Best!❤️❤️❤️  Also very nice and kind"
Mazarine Coffee,Australians don't go here if you want a reasonably priced flat white. Somehow I ended up paying $11.60 AUD for a large. It was an okay coffee... 🤷
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee, Flat white how it should be and the most smiling waitress in whole San Francisco, when you enter you know which one is that ;-) thanks for the amazing morning!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious nitro and fig toast, but had a bag stolen here. It’s close to the tenderloin area so be careful."
Mazarine Coffee,"Serving up most excellent coffee expertly prepared by friendly baristas and hearty toast you must eat with a fork and a knife. They play the best music and the coffee was killer, but I wouldn't go back for the toast."
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice menu for breakfast.  I had the egg and avocado on toast and it was pretty awesome.  The staff was friendly, fast and efficient.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for an early morning coffee and breakfast option"
Mazarine Coffee,Nice coffee shop at downtown to work with your laptop. Their latte was so good too
Mazarine Coffee,"Honestly, this is a top shelf coffee establishment.  I had a pourover of one of their Onyx coffees and it was nigh perfectly executed.  I had an orange chocolate scone to go with it that was beautiful and good but not great.  The space is welcoming and has plenty of room for a work meeting or some time spent working away on your laptop.  There's even a small patio area if you prefer outside seating.  The service was effective and friendly.  Would strongly recommend to anyone in the area!"
Mazarine Coffee,Great Ice Latte but it doesn't hurt to smile 😉
Mazarine Coffee,"The staff here are fantastic, but they are understaffed almost every single morning. The owners should hire additional people during peak hours."
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious toast and cappuccino, can't go wrong! Great local spot, eat and shop local rather than Nestlé owned blue bottle"
Mazarine Coffee,"Very nice place for your breakfast. You have a nice menu of toasts, salads and sandwiches and the coffee is exceptionally good. There are a couple of tables in front with a lot of sun over most times of the day."
Mazarine Coffee,"Delightful modern, specialty coffee paired with really wonderful food. The savory toasts were memorable. Yes, I mean Avocado Toast. The staff clearly enjoys working here and excelling at their craft."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee and eggs & avocado toast but a bit on pricey side.
Mazarine Coffee,"Friendly staff, pleasant interior and atmosphere and, most important, delicious coffee and food.  I will certainly return on my next visit to SF."
Mazarine Coffee,"Their coffee is really unique and offers a big competition to the Starbucks near by. I went there because a friend recommended it and I really liked it personally. The coffee I got was a nitro cold brew. Now this was way too strong for me, so I had to dilute it, but for someone that likes pure strong coffee, this is for you."
Mazarine Coffee,"Coffee was delicious and the coffee shop was cute. They have a good variety of breakfast toasts. unfortunately only with sousvide eggs available, mine were quittttte soft/ see through egg white and I left most of it on the plate."
Mazarine Coffee,Chicken + bacon + avocado toast is soooo nice. The sour sauce on it is tasty.
Mazarine Coffee,Cappuccino and latte for take out. Taste ok but not great
Mazarine Coffee,Awesome fusion based breakfast and brunch cafe. Unique to San Francisco. Easy to get to via Bart. by
Mazarine Coffee,"Good chai latte, clean atmosphere, friendly-enough service ... limited seating but they do manage to keep the riff-raff out. Good food!"
Mazarine Coffee,"They only serve nitro if you’re looking for iced coffee. I usually don’t care for nitro cold brew but it is actually quite good here. Great lunch options for a quick bite, but be prepared to spend $15 on a sandwich."
Mazarine Coffee,"If Maserati was spelled different, and if this place was a car, it would be a MAZARati. Because the food is fast! (If 'fast' meant 'really good')."
Mazarine Coffee,"Great Coffee, Smiling staff, swift service! Just had a delicious Chai Latte here and thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Mazarine Coffee,The takeaway coffee (triple shot flat white) was solid but definitely not worth a 10 minute wait and the USD7 (AUD9 😯) asking price. …
Mazarine Coffee,"The lady preparing hot drinks yelled at a colleague when he asked a question. We found it quite rude. Food and coffee were ok, nothing stellar. Left us wanting more so we went to a cafe down the street and were pleasantly surprised."
Mazarine Coffee,Asked them to make me a long black [120ml hot water with espresso in after] and it was spot on. Coffee had great taste and depth of flavour. 100% would recommend this coffee shop.
Mazarine Coffee,Very popular but also very slow. You Might not want to go here if you just need to grab a quick beverage.
Mazarine Coffee,This was a really cool coffee shop and very chill! Perfect for a smooth espresso.
Mazarine Coffee,"Small footprint with limited seating, but trendy coffee shop. Mix of small and large tables with lots of accesible outlets, and a few patio tables. Enjoyed the Nitro Cold Brew."
Mazarine Coffee,The coffee was really good and I also enjoyed their waffle and berry sauce. Definitely trying to get back before our trip ends!
Mazarine Coffee,Very cozy place I spent a rainy afternoon there and had very nice coffee
Mazarine Coffee,Best coffee (and toast) in town. Don't miss this perfect breakfast place here in SF.
Mazarine Coffee,"I stop by whenever I'm in town for amazing coffee and a nice spot to sit and recoop. Though I hate idea of artisanal toast (come on guys, it's $9 bread), I gotta admit it's delicious"
Mazarine Coffee,Amazing toast options. Coffee was superb and service was friendly. Can't wait to go back
Mazarine Coffee,Loved the ambience and the coffee. Good location and welcoming staff. Service was quick and coffee was unique and rightly done.
Mazarine Coffee,Really good coffee shop but the only drawback is that they don’t provide WiFi. However I still want to give them a five star since their overnight oat and their sandwich are amazingly good! Worth a try.
Mazarine Coffee,"Have been twice a day since arriving in SF. Fantastic coffee, great food. Particularly the morning oats and fresh fruit bowl for breakfast."
Mazarine Coffee,"I used to really enjoy coming here before work but wow has this place gone downhill, unfortunately.  Coffee is SO expensive- I’m happy to pay more for a great coffee but not only did I wait a really long time, my coffee was not hot at all and the espresso tasted burnt. It was barely lukewarm at best which I didn’t realize until I was already down the block.  I was really excited to go back here, sad to be disappointed with somewhere I used to like."
Mazarine Coffee,"Trendy (but delicious) toasts, good coffee, energetic vibe. Worth the wait."
Mazarine Coffee,Good coffee. I’ve heard avocado on toast is good too but haven’t tried myself. Can sometimes be quite a wait
Mazarine Coffee,Nice and small coffee shop in heart of SF. Enjoyed Macchiato with double chocolate banana muffin. Had a  great experience!
Mazarine Coffee,"Good coffee, but a bit pricey (would be 5 star review if a tiny cup of coffee would cost less than $4.5)"
Mazarine Coffee,"More than just espresso blends, they offer a single origin choice. Latte tasty as well."
Mazarine Coffee,First time visit to this coffee shop. Cashier was very nice. Good coffee. Their toasts were delicious. Loved the sousvide egg on mine.
Mazarine Coffee,"Terrific spot! Stumbled on for a coffee and avocado toast. Coffee was delicious. I did not notice on the menu that the toast had goat cheese on it, and found out only after taking a bite. Despite it totally being my bad (all components are described clearly on the menu), they voluntarily opted to give me a new toast, no cheese, no charge and no questions asked. The toast was absolutely delicious too. Will come again."
Mazarine Coffee,"A little pricey, but good espresso style coffee. Usually pretty busy, but you might be able to get a seat."
Mazarine Coffee,I'm a huge coffee fan and can be hard to please. I was not disappointed in Mazarine! Beautiful little shop with great coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,I had the smoked salmon toast. It was really good. If there was anything I could improve was to reduce the cream cheese spread just slightly and more evenly. I also got an iced tea it's very refreshing and they did properly without sugar so you can sweeten it to your own liking.
Mazarine Coffee,"The coffee shop ambiance is really nice. Seating is good too. The mocha I ordered used dandelion chocolate but the coffee tasted more chocolaty. The prices are on expensive side, plus there is no wifi."
Mazarine Coffee,Mazarine Coffee is your go-to café for coffee drinks and small bites near union square.  I had a very positive experience with all the food and beverages ordered by my group.
Mazarine Coffee,Went there in early morning and staff looked so sleepy. Toast is soso and actually not worth of that price. The only good thing is the coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,"Terrible Americano coffee, slightly better than hot dishwater."
Mazarine Coffee,"Understaffed, so they refuse to make espresso drinks.  Yet somehow the eggs are cold despite the wait.  Doesn't matter because the pastries are dreadful anyway, so it's a tourist trap even on a good day."
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice service, great food. A little bit crowded though."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee shop..I will be back.
Mazarine Coffee,"Quite good espresso, well made and good crema, strong and a little bitter, but a great option in San Francisco."
Mazarine Coffee,Best coffee place to work in SF (that I've been to thus far)
Mazarine Coffee,Very cute lil cafe by the market street :)
Mazarine Coffee,Excellent (but pricey) coffee with a nice atmosphere.
Mazarine Coffee,"Horrible tastes, overpriced There was only one similarity to iced tea, and that was the bitterness.  Poached eggs fly over smooshy toast  There were a couple of tables outside with the smell of worse public bathrooms"
Mazarine Coffee,The best coffee I had in San Francisco. Try their drip! It’s fantastic. Vibe is on point. Perfect spot for a quick morning brew.
Mazarine Coffee,Amazing coffee!!
Mazarine Coffee,"My friend introduced me to this cute and lovely coffee spot in SF. The Cold Brew Coffee is absolutely the best! It's so smooth, strong and refreshing. They also have different types of savory and sweet toast available.We tried a savory and sweet toast. The Avocado and Egg toast was really good! It was well balanced between the avocado slices and 2 sous vide eggs. This was my favorite of the two toasts."
Mazarine Coffee,Good for breakfast/brunch but not an ideal cafe to work on laptops
Mazarine Coffee,Nice hip cafe with a wide selection of avocado toast and sandwiches. There was a bit of a line and little seating but we were able to find a spot outside. The coffee was great and the chicken club sandwich was the best i ever had. My wife had the beet hummus avocado toast which she quite enjoyed.
Mazarine Coffee,"Great food, they have tasty toasts for meals."
Mazarine Coffee,"One of the best sports store, great service all time!"
Mazarine Coffee,"A place for a to-go or a quick bite right off the Market Street.  A creative range of fare and friendly staff, but the space is smallish and doesn't feel inviting. Definitely not a place to work - it's too busy and crowded."
Mazarine Coffee,"Mazarine Coffee = Quintessential San Francisco.  As I'm saying this, I'm sure plenty of people will come to argue saying that real SF can only be represented by establishments in the Castro, or that establishments themselves, are not real SF. In my experience as both a bay area resident and as an SF tourist, Mazarine Coffee checks off all of the boxes of what I'd expect for a trendy cafe that's in a high traffic location. The food/ drink offerings are plentiful, the staff is diverse and friendly, and the prices aren't too bad!  Mazarine has plenty of nice drink options, both for the coffee lovers among us, as well as those of us who are more coffee averse (try the limeade, it's surprisingly refreshing). I really wish I was a local to try more of their options, but from all I've heard, the menu is well put together.  Additionally, the toast options are to die for. Before I move on, let me say that I am not normally a toast person. When my friend told me that Mazarine Coffee was known for its toasts, I was (not so) silently hoping that he meant french toasts. However, the savory toasts are fantastic. I got the Bacon, Egg, and Avocado toast, and it's definitely worth the price. It's a good amount of food without making you feel stuffed/ like you have to take half home, but also manages to pack a good punch of flavor into a limited space.  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Mazarine Coffee, I don't think you'll regret it!"
Mazarine Coffee,Excellent coffee and tea. Staff were super friendly and we really enjoyed our breakfast as well. I had the overnight oats and my wife had the fig & ricotta toast.
Mazarine Coffee,"Food is really good.  I especially liked the pickled veg garnish.  Comes out relatively quickly.  You can tell they use quality ingredients.  Service is friendly.  Only con is finding a seat can be tricky during the lunch rush.  Might have to share a table with someone else, which I know is still catching on here in the states, but who knows, you might make a new friend."
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee place and cafe. I had their rotating pour over coffee and a slice of their toast with tomato, ricotta, and pesto. The toast was excellent, with a large thick piece of bread and plenty of topping. Both times I visited (8am Monday and 10am Saturday) the place was nearly full, with seating for 1-2 available by the time my order was ready."
Mazarine Coffee,"The coffee is great and the staff polite. I've never had the food, but it is beautiful and pricey. I'd fault the place for the cost, but it's not overly marked up considering it is in prime market retail space and rent isn't cheap.  This place often has long lines, and cramped tables where laptop workers spread out to fill the minimal space. I've come here twice now for a coffee chat, and after waiting for 5-15 minutes, we simply have to give up and go elsewhere. Somewhat of a pain if you've ordered to dine in. Ultimately this is simply a testament to this place's success, so don't skip it simply because you won't get to sit down.  Come to grab your beverage to go, and you will not be disappointed!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Great espresso, careful pourovers too. Great breakfasts."
Mazarine Coffee,A great spot on the weekend to have breakfast! Cool vibe. Great avo toast!
Mazarine Coffee,"Amazing avocado toast with poached eggs! I hope you enjoy runny yolk!  The coffee here is also top notch. And to top it all off, the service is impeccable. They won't bring your food or drinks to your table but when you're ordering, they are super friendly and nice and don't rush you even though there's a long line behind you.  Highly recommend this coffee shop"
Mazarine Coffee,"Coffee was well made and delicious. The cappuccino was a bit big (maybe almost 8oz milk), and there is no wifi. I was lucky and didn't have to wait (at 7:15). By 7:45 there was a line of commuters. The snacks looked amazing and artistic, but I didn't have any. Would definitely go again."
Mazarine Coffee,The best capuccino in San Francisco!!!! Every day!
Mazarine Coffee,Great spot in a central SF location.   But Barista takes breaks so no espresso drinks when that happens.   Update:  absolutely PERFECT Latte!!
Mazarine Coffee,"Excellent coffee and excellent food! This great location has a good amount of seating inside, providing you with time to sit and enjoy their food. The menu is straightforward, with a good amount of options. It's well maintained inside, with nicely designed furniture. WiFi is available, so you will see people on their computers enjoying their coffee. A good coffee shop to come to, have a drink, chow, and chat with friends!"
Mazarine Coffee,Way overpriced. Ok food. Came here a couple times to meet with friends. Hard to find seats.
Mazarine Coffee,The coffee here is so good that you'll want to order an espresso just for the taste of it.  It had just the right amount of foam and sweetness to make me want another sip!
Mazarine Coffee,"My friend had the beet hummus & avocado toast and i had the salmon toast with Latte. The toast was very thick and a bit stiff, need a bit pressure to slice it off. But not too harsh for chewing. The slightly salty salmon serve a good balance with the toast. One toast is just something you would expect from a cafe to fulfill your stomach. The beet hummus & avocado toast were not as flavorful as salmon toast. It is visual enjoyable and extremely healthy. The beet hummus is fresh and similar to what you can get from “berkeley bowl market”.  The latte was decent but the design of the mug and saucer is well-considered and functional. (The saucer is in the shape of oval corresponding to the handle of the mug). The location is right on the most busiest street, easy to find. Good vibes, can be hard to find seat during busy hours. There is a comfortable distance away from the crowds to make you feel not interrupted (private space) enjoying your favorites."
Mazarine Coffee,This coffee is maybe the best cup I’ve ever had. Perfectly balanced and brewed... just got a regular drip to go. Thought the size was a little small but the amount of caffeine it punches is the same as a too-legit-to-quit cold brew. Staff is super nice and helpful. I only got the to go coffee so I have no clue about anything else :-)
Mazarine Coffee,Good good good coffee place  We really enjoyed going there for specialty coffee and weren’t disappointed at all.  They build awesome espresso and a great flat white.  Some bites to eat are available as well.  Will come back again for sure!
Mazarine Coffee,Friendly staff. I had an ice coffee on a hot sunny day. It was super yummy and was exactly what I needed to cool off. Nice outdoor seating area. Indoors tables were a bit too close for my comfort. Nevertheless a great little cafe.
Mazarine Coffee,They Provide The Same According to our taste 🔥💕 …
Mazarine Coffee,I really loved the food and the coffee. Prices are ok and they are really quick.
Mazarine Coffee,"Pick a “toast”, any toast, they’re all delicious.  Espresso based drinks are as good as it gets."
Mazarine Coffee,"Great avocado toast and overnight oats. Oats weren't too sweet, had a nice consistency and good portion. Drip coffee was also good.  Early at around 8:00am there was no wait and no problem finding a table."
Mazarine Coffee,Very good food but it's a shame they only do runny eggs and no other way....
Mazarine Coffee,"A slightly confused experience, but good coffee at the end of it. Ordering in this place doesn't seem to work - they don't always take your name but expect to call it out when your coffee is ready. Perhaps it was teething problems with a new member of staff, but given how much this place loves itself (clue: a lot!) I'm have thought they'd be a bit more on the ball. But the coffee is great, and breakfast toasts utterly delicious!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Very good espresso -- almost great, so like a great minus. The staff is friendly. The quality of the espresso may depend on who is working the machine. There is a fairly good breakfast menu, but I only had some pastries, which were good."
Mazarine Coffee,"One of the best coffee shops in Union Square with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The coffee is fantastic. Don't be deterred by a sometimes long line, it moves fast. The avocado and poached eggs on toast looks amazing and something I would love to try. All of the Aussies at work go to Mazarine (including me!)"
Mazarine Coffee,"This is a calm and relaxing cafe in the heart of Downtown San Francisco. Their carry very good quality and delicious coffee here. They're spacious with a good amount of seats and table for you seat back with your book, laptop and just enjoy their good coffee and service."
Mazarine Coffee,"Excellent coffee and delicious breakfast, the staff was friendly"
Mazarine Coffee,"My friend and I checked this place out and enjoyed the toast options for breakfast. I find a lot of the breakfast options heavy so this is a nice alternative. I had the raspberry nutella, which was good, but was more heavy on nutella. The egg and avocado was pretty yummy. Drinks were good too. Nice location right on Market seat with outdoor seating available. Do check it out!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Incredible $11 avocado toast (really).  Love the space, it’s low key and you’ll leave feeling satisfied with coffee and breakfast."
Mazarine Coffee,The ricota and tomate toast is really nice. Enjoy the almond milk with coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,"Only 16 months in and Mazarine Coffee place is making coffee addicts queue up every morning to get a sip of their favourite shot.  If you're ever in San Francisco you have to try it. Whether you walk by or make a specific stroll down Market street just for that, you won't be disappointed. Great atmosphere in these minimalist yet robust interiors, offering delicious toasties and absolutely great coffee.  Ask for the available flavours!  P.S. Avocado poached eggs with some ham on the side is always a great choice"
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice interior, great sandwiches and baked goods. Wouldn't go here for coffee though. Ordered a flat white with a double shot of their Ethiopian - after first not really getting the concept of 'Flat White' I got told all their coffees get served flat white style (what?), I got surprised with a (mediocre) espresso as black as the cashier's soul who couldn't tell me where the white in that is either. It was too busy to really discuss this any further, and expensive."
Mazarine Coffee,Good independent coffee and friendly service ☕👌
Mazarine Coffee,expensive but good caffe.. avocado toast good but small
Mazarine Coffee,Essential accessories Get more from your Surface with accessories designed to enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow Summited Everest Into his i  own party leader's okh..
Mazarine Coffee,"Great pourovers, but slightly pricey ($6). Espresso was well made as well."
Mazarine Coffee,"Good sandwiches, has power outlets and wifi, crowded but you can share a table. Fun people watching. So happy this place is still here and just as great and has weathered the pandemic!"
Mazarine Coffee,My favorite brunch place in San Francisco! perfect Avocado toast and the beet hummus is very good too. You sometimes have to wait a little for seating but you'll generally have something by the time your food is ready. :)
Mazarine Coffee,Coffees are exceptional. Had the Gibraltar. Well balanced. Delicious
Mazarine Coffee,"This is my 3rd time visiting San Francisco and my second time coming here. I love the toasts! I’ve only gotten the savory ones, because they are so good. The avocado toast with the radish is amazing. I got an iced chai latte and it wasn’t 99% milk like most places, it actually tasted like chai. Love this place!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Great concept. Rotating roasters as pour-over options, and lots of good toast options. The two stars are for the disinterested/apathetic staff. Specialty coffee is an exciting and fascinating, relational industry, but here it seems like it’s just a job to them."
Mazarine Coffee,"Food was delicious! Coffee was really good too. A little bit sad that they didn't have sweetener only sugar. And that I asked for a coffee with heavy cream but they gave me a coffee and directed me to get the heavy cream from the stand with the sugar, which wasn't heavy cream they only had half and half. But the taste was really good!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee  choice of milks including oat. I had the avocado and beet hummus on toast, well presented and tasted very fresh.Even though it can be a jostle for tables there seems to be a steady flow.Great place for a quick bite."
Mazarine Coffee,"Enjoyed a shot of espresso and smoked salmon toast for breakfast. They have a variety of trendy toasts to satisfy different diets and tastes. I found the beet hummus toast to exemplify their style and ethos with its brilliant magenta color and detailed presentation, but I opted for the smoked salmon to sustain me for a hard day's work ahead. I found they chose presentation over practicality with this dish, since thin slices of cucumber would have worked better for flavor and experience, but the spears made for more dynamic visual impact. Regardless, I enjoyed it immensely."
Mazarine Coffee,"A busy cafe with great coffee. Pour over is highly recommended. If you come at a peak hour, reserve 30mins to get your coffee. Pan au Chocolate is also nice and they can heat up for you. The staff is friendly. Overall good experience. If your coffee is to go, the only cons is that they don't offer cup sleeve so remember to get some tissues to make your own sleeve."
Mazarine Coffee,"The lag in receiving your beverage is long enough for warm food to become cold.  This is a standard SF speciality restaurant of which there are many, that believes decent food compensates for indifferent service.  The food and coffee are fine, the staff is precious and meeting your needs clearly interferes with other priorities.  I will generally pass on reviewing rather than pan a business.  The owners would do well to orient their staff toward meeting customers 1/2 way.  I understand and have observed obnoxious customers in the city that can make service jobs difficult, that said, indifferent staff doesn't make the situation better."
Mazarine Coffee,"Good coffee with interesting flavors, great toast (both sweet and savory varieties), decent service. Really packed though (had to wait a while to grab a table), and very overpriced for what it is. Fun to people-watch here."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee and super friendly service! I'm really glad they reopened. Try onenof their specialty drinks or their avo toast. Their pastries are also amazing.
Mazarine Coffee,"We were came to SF for a girls get together. My sister found this place on yelp.  We parked our car near Macy's.  We passed by so many Starbucks to get this restaurant. We ordered the egg and avocado sandwich which was good, walnut banana bread was delicious and cold nitro cold brew was of okay. Overall the place was great and I would definitely come back."
Mazarine Coffee,"This is a nice cafe. I've only been a couple of times and both times did not involve coffee, unfortunately. On my last visit, I had the Ham, Egg, and Cheese Toast. I loved it. I was so hungry, I kind of wanted another one halfway through. The staff here is great too."
Mazarine Coffee,"Good toast, but don't come when it's busy. Especially for coffee. It took 30+ minutes to get a latte after ordering it. I was able to get my toast and eat it before waiting an additional 15 minutes for my drink. Coffee was just ok. This was also when Google said it wasn't as busy as it usually is."
Mazarine Coffee,"Ridiculously expensive and no Wi-Fi. It’s always crowded but I have no idea why. $7 for a latte, $9 for a single piece of toast with cheese, $15 for a low-quality sandwich (The prices listed on the Google Maps menu are not accurate). I received a gift card for this place but I would never spend my own money here. Staff is nice though, bathroom is clean."
Mazarine Coffee,"Supremely tasty ""toasts"", great coffee (try their Gibraltar or their Raf), and comfy seats.  Can get crowded, but worth the trip.  A nice and interesting place for breakfast (or probably lunch).  Steps from the Four Seasons hotel."
Mazarine Coffee,"My favorite coffee in SF. At one point they were always playing ambient electronic music, and that was the best. They have lovely cups that feel nice in your hands. No wifi, so you have to sit and look at your coffee or at other patrons."
Mazarine Coffee,Delicious coffee and filling Californian cafe food. Interior is charming but can get full and a little noisy. If your looking for a fun place to chat and rest from touring or shopping this is great. If you’re looking to study you might consider a quieter and less crowded location.
Mazarine Coffee,"For the longest time I didn't like this crowded and busy shop... But I started going here more and more, because they are the only thing open on the weekends. What I found out is the reason behind the crowds.  At first glance the menu is over priced and the coffee is alright.  After going a few more times I found that the healthy California cuisine is great for a light lunch and you can generally squeeze into a seat if you're by yourself.  For the area, I generally prefer iron horse coffee or better yet, walking a bit further and getting Chapel Hill Coffee, but neither are open on the weekends, so this is a more than adequate replacement."
Mazarine Coffee,Cool place with great coffee. Avocado toast is amazing!
Mazarine Coffee,Service is friendly and quick if you need a mid-day pick-me-up. The space is great for quick meetings and not for working all day (which is a plus). Prices are comparable to other over-priced coffees in San Francisco.
Mazarine Coffee,"Excellent coffee, friendly service, charming interior; I often find myself here at least a few times a month. I loved this place! I'm a huge coffee shop aficionado and this place is now one of my favorites."
Mazarine Coffee,Good ambience and good taste.
Mazarine Coffee,Delicious! Great service and a pretty good amount of seating.
Mazarine Coffee,"Great drip coffee. We also ordered and enjoyed the overnight oats. Extremely busy inside on a Thursday morning, with a few ""campers"". Couldn't find seating inside. Will be back!"
Mazarine Coffee,Really loved the calm atmosphere on a early Saturday morning in the city. My coffee and breakfast were fantastic. I order the thick cut toast with smoked salmon and avocado.
Mazarine Coffee,"Space can get a little tight during the early morning bustle but the coffee and toasts make it worth it - the servings are generous and delicious. And if you can find a spot to post up with your laptop, it makes a great place to set up shop for a wfh day."
Mazarine Coffee,"What a great coffee shop, decent espresso, drips, and poor overs. My favorite nitro cold brew to date. It's full bodied and has slightly more nitro than you find other places. This smoothes it out further and it stays separated for longer. The food is absolutely awesome. I've had every avocado toast on the menu and can say that they are the best I've had period. I stop here every time I'm in the city. It can be quite busy but if you arrive before 8am you can usually find a table."
Mazarine Coffee,"So good, Came two days in a row."
Mazarine Coffee,"Pretentious, unwelcoming, and just not customer friendly. Obvious irritation from staff upon ordering. They have no idea of coffee lingo such as blended and frappe. They don't make them, but instead of telling you they hand you a bitter hot coffee like it's what you ordered. When the cashier clearly said yes we have blended frappe beverages. I went to return it but was met with such a face I said nothing and just walked out."
Mazarine Coffee,"Mazarine Coffee is located right on Market street, in the midst of a busy area of San Francisco. The staff are friendly and nice, the food is okay, and the coffee is good. The ambiance is nice for dropping in to get a cup of joe with a friend or colleague, but the space is always crowded, so be prepared to wait a long time for a table, or just grab your coffee to go. Not great for large crowds or for spending extended periods of time."
Mazarine Coffee,"Food: OMG the hummus avocado toast is delicious!!! It comes with roasted beets and feta cheese and it's one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. There are other options as well but this was so good that I keep eating this one every time. Because of these options, this is a great place for vegetarians and you can ask to customize things if you are vegan. I also tried the Fig Jam & Ricotta toast but it was too sweet for me (it also comes with black pepper which I liked but some people may not).  Coffee: I only tried the Gibraltar but it was delicious! It was sharp and warm.  Ambiance/Space: this place is always packed! But you can get a table if you wait a few minutes. There's also an outside patio and free wi-fi. Washrooms are at the back of the cafe.  Accessibility: the entrance is wide enough for a wheelchair and tables are the right height. Washrooms are also accessible for those in wheelchairs."
Mazarine Coffee,"Amazing coffee. The nitro cold brew is especially excellent. Haven't had too much of their food, but the Mazarine waffle is delicious. The pearl sugar really adds to it."
Mazarine Coffee,"Mazarine was the first place to introduce me to nitro infused cold brew coffee and I'm forever grateful. The atmosphere is really nice and is perfect for taking your drink to go, or staying for a bit. The staff has always been really friendly and helpful if it is your first time there. Overall great experience."
Mazarine Coffee,"Probably the best espresso in SF and very good milk drinks (Gibraltar, latte, etc.). Great pastries and toasts as well. Often crowded. Accessible entrance and step-free bathroom with width restrictions."
Mazarine Coffee,"This is an AMAZING place for food and drinks... A lil pricey but WORTH it! They have a variety of ""toast"" covered in different yummy ingredients a MUST try! Especially ham & egg or avocado... Hard to choose one, bring a friend and share a couple different ones."
Mazarine Coffee,"Mazarine is one of my go-to places for a good espresso. There's a rotating selection of different beans and roasters which keeps the variety interesting and fresh. So far, the few times I went, there were always two blends being pulled, a brighter cup and a more traditional darker (medium) blend. Both are great and should cover any espresso lover needing a fix."
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice coffee shop, but the day I went was a little dirty than other coffee shops."
Mazarine Coffee,"The best coffee in town.  Super chill location with soothing music, friendly staff, and fast internet.  It's a great place to meet up or do some writing .  The almond latte was the best I've had in San Francisco."
Mazarine Coffee,"Nice interior and great espresso-based drinks (we had espresso and gibraltar). We didn't have time for food, but sandwiches looked delicious. 1 star off only because 14 minutes for 2 drinks is a bit longer than we expected being second in the line."
Mazarine Coffee,The coffee shop I hit whenever I'm in San Fran. Great coffee from local roasters with good avocado toast. They really need to take people's last name... Not unlikely that you'll get your order claimed by the wrong person!
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee, nice toasts. The mochi muffin is great. I got one to go and after I had one bite I turned around and bought all the rest left in store and took it back to New York with me..."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee and the food is nice as well
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee spot that also serves booze and food. I got the mocha and my friend got the drip. Both were amazing, and the space was chill and welcoming. Skip Starbucks and come here. Only downside was trying to find a place to sit in this cozy shop."
Mazarine Coffee,Classic SF coffee shop with classic SF prices. This has great food and a very warm atmosphere. Theres lots of seating but because it's a busy places it can be hard to find a spot. The staff are friendly and the coffee is 100%.
Mazarine Coffee,"Located right on Market Street, not too far from the Westfield Mall. Nice selection of artesian, drip coffees and also sandwiches and munchies.  Nice vibe, but can get quite busy waiting for a seat. They have a small outdoor section, but that's better left when the weather is sunny."
Mazarine Coffee,"a little gem. excellent coffee and fabulous breakfast toasts with avocado, eggs and everything you wish for, beautifully presented. they also serve waffles & oat, sandwiches and salads but we didn't try."
Mazarine Coffee,Great place for coffee. If you are looking for a single origin pour over or just a hot cup of coffee this place has it down. Food is very good as well. Though expensive their whole bean coffee is excellent. Broad selection.
Mazarine Coffee,Another happy Aussie having found great coffee close enough to Union Square whilst visiting San Francisco.  The coffee here was consistently great during our four day stay..thanks to the other Aussies who mentioned it in their reviews...most helpful.
Mazarine Coffee,"The ricotta toasts are a nice breakfast but ultimately the coffee—both espresso and batch-brew—was just ok. If I were pressed for time and right there I would go back, but otherwise I probably wouldn’t go way out of my way for it."
Mazarine Coffee,"Mint Tea...done. This stuff is so delicious there. My only issue is that this place is very busy and getting a seat can be difficult. Then, when you do get a seat, it's in the middle of a lot of people waiting for their orders. But the tea in the gorgeous ceramic mugs makes up for it."
Mazarine Coffee,"Adorable coffee shop, with really really good coffee - right on market street."
Mazarine Coffee,Great atmosphere and they have some great food selections here to enjoy with your coffee. My espresso was a touch tart the time I came here but their poached egg on toast made up for it.
Mazarine Coffee,"The latte I had has a special flavor you don't get from other cafe.  The frothy milk was perfect.  Not just foam on top of milk.  If the froth is done right, it's creamy and smooth and that's what I got.  It's little bit expensive for a slightly small cup of latte.  But the location is downtown.  So you can't really expect anything cheap."
Mazarine Coffee,Fantastic coffee and sandwiches! Great atmosphere!
Mazarine Coffee,"If you’re an Australian looking for decent coffee - it’s a must visit! Friendly staff, comfortable vibe with enough seating to not feel guilty about hanging out to work. Oh and did I mention the coffee is GREAT!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Made my latte pretty much like Australia n NZ.   Note, you'll need an extra shot if you want the strength to resemble Downunder espresso.  They weigh the coffee out and for some reason places that do that always serve weaker coffee....???!!   Anyway - an extra shot closely resembles decent coffee from back home"
Mazarine Coffee,"Good, but overpriced. But again, that's what hipster cafes offer anyways."
Mazarine Coffee,"This the THE BEST place in the Bay Area, hands down.  Incredibly inviting environment, top-notch espresso, friendly staff.  The cafe's layout is very thoughtful with beautiful and modern decor that's not over-the-top.  The music volume level is low enough where you can have a conversation.  The ambiance is always warm and inviting amidst the hussle-and-bussle of the downtown/financial district area of Market.  Don't go anywhere else.  I live in the East Bay and always make a special trip to Mazarine whenever I go into the city, which is very conveniently located off the BART/MUNI.  Let's make sure we keep this place in business!!!!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Good coffee, awful pastries. I got Danish with barely any cheese on it. My fiance threw out half of her waffle that neither one of us could eat. Giving 4 stars for coffee, 1 star for pastries."
Mazarine Coffee,"Setting up a pop-up down the street and every morning we come in with a big order. Every morning the food is delicious, made quickly, and the staff are so nice and accommodating. Really lovely experience every time!"
Mazarine Coffee,Easily an amazing breakfast and the nitro cold brew is so tasty and smooth
Mazarine Coffee,"Great little spot, probably the best in the area for a solid pour over coffee and breakfast. I was here for a week for a conference and tried everything within a 10 or so minute walk from near Moscone. This was the best, even when I returned at the other end of the week."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee. Great breakfast.
Mazarine Coffee,"sure it looks swanky and fru-fru from outside but its a little too high on itself considering the food.  I know..its a coffee shop, but they big up these ""toasts"" like they are the best thing since eggs benedict.  Well let me tell you...they are not.  The toast was dry and burnt, not a single drop of butter ever touched my lips and the eggs on top were barely even heated through.  All this deliciousness can be your for like 10 bucks!  This one was a tough meal to swallow, literally!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Decent food and coffee, if a bit pricey. I was shocked that my $3 drip coffee in a 10oz. cup did not have refills. I don't own a coffee cup that small at home. 10 ounces of coffee is a tiny start to a day. Had to repair to a national chain for reinforcements."
Mazarine Coffee,"This is honestly just about the best coffee I've ever had! And not by American standards - which is usually diabolical - but anywhere in the world, including Australia where we like to imagine that we make the best coffee. I may no longer believe it after visiting this place."
Mazarine Coffee,"Really lovely staff. They get a lot of tourists who don't really know what a pour over is and they do a really great job at being patient. Good coffee, didn't have any food but it looked great!"
Mazarine Coffee,"This was some of the best coffee that I have ever had. The food was awesome as well. The service was impeccable. The only bad thing is getting a table, but this is to be expected for an excellent place like this."
Mazarine Coffee,"5 5 5 stars all the way. Beetroot humus and avocado, smoked salmon, latte and oolong tea all for the win. Everything was delicious and pretty quick out after ordering.  ....days later I'm still dreaming about returning to this heavenly spot."
Mazarine Coffee,Great little local shop with lovely cappuccinos and delicious baked goods. Their dark roast espresso is smooth and rich and they are true foam artists!
Mazarine Coffee,"This place is too serious. It's almost unapproachable until you start talking to the people working there.  The toast is seemingly overpriced, but then you're really hungry. So, you pay for a 8 dollar toast while thinking this is the biggest rip off since the last presidential election. You will proceed to get pissed at the toast because it's so damn good that you hate yourself for being wrong.  Also, the coffee is solid. Like Northwest solid. If it ever rains and gets cold here, and I go get a cappachino at Mazarine, it will remind me of my Seattle days in the U-district wasting time on yet another take-for-granted coffee run..."
Mazarine Coffee,"Sylish, slick and shiney.  The espresso roast is a pleasant, soft blend that balances very well with the stretched milk - no bitterness.  There are no flavor options.  There are several quick bite options all oriented toward the modern crowd, but each are overpriced."
Mazarine Coffee,Love that place. Really good drinks. My wife love the Raf and their hot choc is really good but I often come by just to get their mochi pastries which are delicious!!
Mazarine Coffee,One of the best avocado egg toast in the Bay Area. Serves great coffee with weekly rotation from different roaster.  Always keeps their espresso beans dialed you right throughout the day.
Mazarine Coffee,Their Matcha latte is great! They make the mixture in bulk so it's not traditional Matcha tea but wonderful all the same. Also has a trendy atmosphere for meeting people too.
Mazarine Coffee,"Egg whites were runny yet yolks were solid, not even sure how that's possible but didn't enjoy them. I maybe got four super thin slices of avocado, nothing like the photos I've seen from others. Expected more for the high price tag."
Mazarine Coffee,A bunch of veg options. Faultless coffee (Gibraltar!) and delicious food!
Mazarine Coffee,"Finally! A decent espresso in SF. Tried all the hotspots and can't misses and they all missed --- consistently underextracted (thin and sour). Mazarine, however, makes a respectable espresso and cappuccino, and sipping it on the sidewalk in the sun watching the world walk by was quite enjoyable."
Mazarine Coffee,Great vibe but only decent coffee. The avocado toast on the other hand....supberb. I'm giving it three stars though because they got my order wrong and I didn't find out until I was already in my Uber.
Mazarine Coffee,Coffee was great. Server was friendly and on top of her game. Ambiance was kitschy and it looked just like you would have expected from the sign out front.
Mazarine Coffee,Extremely nice and well presented food for such a small place. I have been here 3 weekends in a row. Highly recommend the avo eggs toast and beet hummus toast.
Mazarine Coffee,"This cafe is my go-to for pre-work meetings as it’s oddly one of the decent coffee shops that are actually open early. Great coffee, and delicious small toasts if you need a breakfast bite too."
Mazarine Coffee,Excellent coffee and a great local spot - only wish they were open weekends!
Mazarine Coffee,"If you blink, you might pass the cafe but this unassuming non-chain cafe serves up delectable savory and sweet food. The #oatcapp is available and they will even fill up your water bottle with sparkling water of you ask nicely. A nice oasis admist the bustling Market Street in San Francisco."
Mazarine Coffee,"I like to get their Iced Breve Latte. You place your order at the front counter. They accept both cash and credit cards (including AMEX). The cashier will ask for a name for the order. Remember to spell out your name to avoid any confusion. Otherwise, your order may be ready but you didn’t recognize the name on the order. (In the past, I have had my name spelled an unusual way, because I didn’t spell it out for the cashier and the person just typed it in their own creative way. 😂 The person who made my order didn’t even bother saying the “name,” because it would be difficult to pronounce and I wouldn’t realize it was for me.) The food items are available early, no need to wait for lunch time. But it’s always a good idea to ask whether any items are sold out/unavailable."
Mazarine Coffee,The latte and toast are on point! No regrets here!
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee, but that's where it ends. Overpriced, mediocre pastries slow service, I mean - extremely slow. The place is also filled with students taking up space with their laptops, who just never, ever leave. I wouldn't mind if the place was spacier and could support it. Avoid or get it to go."
Mazarine Coffee,"I trekked here because of the highlighted comment that there is high-speed internet. Food & service quality were high, but over-priced and they confirmed that they do not provide wifi connection. I should have stayed at the Starbucks I was standing next to when I found this place through the map search on my iPhone."
Mazarine Coffee,Great brunch spot and their toasts are a must try
Mazarine Coffee,"Good coffee, if a little slow - but to be honest, that's a complaint of mine generally in SF.  Baristas could learn a lot from Australian cafes arguably the best in the world for coffee quality and keeping up with a demanding crowd."
Mazarine Coffee,"**GOOD TOASTS AND COFFEE**  PARKING ======== Garage or nearby street. It's on Market, so it's busy.  AMBIANCE ========= A few tables outside, more tables inside.  Chic, clean, and somewhat French regal with personality.  Only one small communal table that has natural lighting for Insta photos (of course we sat there).  COFFEE ======= DOUBLE ESPRESSO Should have ordered a cappuccino. The espresso was very bitter, not smooth. RATONG: 3/5  TOASTS ===== AVOCADO Avocado, chèvre cheese, radish, chives, sea salt, and cracked pepper on a toasted pain de mie was beautifully-presented and the flavors were excellent together. Very French and lovely. RATING: 5/5  PEANUT BUTTER AND HONEY The PB was too chalky, I prefer smooth and creamy. Difficult to eat with thick toast. RATING: 3/5  OVERALL ======== All about the avocado and next time, a cappuccino.  RECOMMEND if you're near Union Square or Market Street."
Mazarine Coffee,Really good coffee. As good as anywhere in SF. V slow tho!
Mazarine Coffee,"Service was great, and so was the coffee! Flat white 👌 …"
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious pastrami Reuben sandwich. Reasonable prices (for SF FiDi). Ritual coffee! Haven't tried the baked goods yet, but they look great."
Mazarine Coffee,This is solid 5 star coffee - I think it is the best cappuccino I've had. The fancy toast and other light fare along with a selection of pastries are very good too.
Mazarine Coffee,Very nice place right on Market. Friendly staff and the cappuccino I had was top of the line. I didn't order any food but it looks good and I would definitely go back
Mazarine Coffee,Never had a bad visit. Great drip and espresso drinks. If you're hungry they have some great food options as well.
Mazarine Coffee,Had a piccolo and an avocado toast.  Just great.  Fast service
Mazarine Coffee,"very cozy place to sit and have conversation or get the work done. I've tried their avocado, egg and bacon toast and it was really good. Capucino is also very good."
Mazarine Coffee,Coffee is great but the toasts are a bit lacking in flavor. Nothing special about it.
Mazarine Coffee,Amazing experience! Great service and the coffee/pastries do not disappoint. Love the ambiance too; the menus are extra.
Mazarine Coffee,amazing coffee. very good and tasteful toasts. good environment. if you need to get some work done bring a laptop. highly recommend.
Mazarine Coffee,"Excellent spot, especially if you can get a table outside. Coffee was great and will definitely visit again when I’m in the mood to sit outside. Also, excellent service!"
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee and waffles. Really nice chill place to get food. Not a ""spend all day"" place, but rather a coffee shop to spend 20-60 minutes at"
Mazarine Coffee,Good latte. Not as expensive as Four Barrel (about 50c cheaper). Plenty of seating inside. Great place to enjoy good coffee when you need a break from shopping.
Mazarine Coffee,"Great coffee, great atmosphere, and some dang impressive beet avocado toast, which at least has a vibrant purple color to separate it from regular avocado toast."
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee! Oat milk latte I had was phenomenal (califia barista oat milk)
Mazarine Coffee,"My husband used to work within walking distance to this shop, so he was there often. Whenever I visit the city I try to stop in. The coffee is yummy and the service is great."
Mazarine Coffee,The espresso shots here are hella intense and perfect for someone who enjoys straight up shots. Points for serving it with sparkling water ;)
Mazarine Coffee,"I have had many good coffees around the world. As someone who regularly travels throughout Europe and occasionally sees the south ammericas, the coffe offered here is beyond exceptional."
Mazarine Coffee,A great spot to stop in our your way to work. Grab a coffee and head on your way or stick around for a while and enjoy the community of business peoples making deals left and right. Nice friendly customer service and great coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,VERY STRONG coffee. I ordered an iced chai latte and it was just intense flavor. I couldn't tell if it had flavor or if I was drinking just straight espresso. But it seemed very popular and the crowd all had laptops so it was preassumed these were the people that needed that much caffine in their life. 4 Stars just because it's pricey and because they don't offer the option to costumize drinks. (As in I couldnt add a shot of vanilla to my $6 small chai)
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee and avocado toast for breakfast
Mazarine Coffee,Great coffee and pastry. Can get a bit crowded...
Mazarine Coffee,"The food was good, but the baristas were awful.  There was only one person cleaning tables while the barristas were idly standing by.   And when I asked for something (for a second time). The barista was ofended..."
Mazarine Coffee,"Favorite spot in the city,  with the beautiful people and expensive coffee that tastes good black."
Mazarine Coffee,Cute and cozy coffee shop. The food was good and reasonable price as well! Definitely a good lunch spot to stop by if you are around Westfield mall or union square area.
Mazarine Coffee,"I really like the atmosphere... I've only been during the day, but it sounds like a fun in the evenings too. Their coffee is delicious, especially the cold brew."
Mazarine Coffee,"I know millennials get a ton of flak for dropping $7 on avocado toast, but this place is the reason why we do. Awesome food and gourmet coffee in an art-deco space."
Mazarine Coffee,fell in love with this place from the 1st taste. the staff was very welcoming and sociable. prices are fair. mood here reminds me of san diego's scene.
Mazarine Coffee,"Really great coffee in the middle of SF. Perfect flat whites for any travelling coffee snobby Australians... also, the beet hummus toast was delicious!"
Mazarine Coffee,"The coffee is good, the place is nice, but there’s no WiFi for guests, no AC (it was a hot day). If you’re planning on getting some study/work done, forget about it."
Mazarine Coffee,Great food and great coffee. Been visiting here for ten days and this is our go to place every day. Good healthy options.
Mazarine Coffee,"Strongest Nitro Cold Brew in the city. Have one of those and your brain will be buzzing for a few hours. It is the only coffee that we get here as it is quite unique, but truly packs a punch."
Mazarine Coffee,Excellent baristas make Mazarine one of my favorite spots for coffee in SF. My only complaint is that it can hard to find a table in the middle of the day!
Mazarine Coffee,A tad expensive but their nitro cold brew is good. Also a good simple food option on Market in this area if you are just walking around and don't want a sit down/don't want something heavy.
Mazarine Coffee,"Coffee isn’t bad, but their breakfast selection is great. Very good gf toasts - love the avocado and tomato."

Mazarine Coffee,Great selection of coffee and drinks. Can get busy so it might be hard to find a place to sit depending on the time you come in. Be sure to try their Nitro Cold Brew coffee!
Mazarine Coffee,"Oh my goodness - this place is excellent.  Pour over was outstanding, and bacon avocado toast was amazing.  Friendly staff too."
Mazarine Coffee,"Came in for tea/coffee with a friend the other day. The service is great and the open floor plan makes it an awesome spot to relax, get some work done, or people watch."
Mazarine Coffee,I was burned out from riding my bike all day and needed a hot cup of coffee. My phone was almost dead. I also needed a charger cause I left mine at home. I called the shop. Joe answered. He was very patient and helpful with directions. Then I got lost because I wasn't paying attention when he was talking. I called back and now Ben answered. He directed me in like I was a 747 lost on the runway. Mazarine was right in front of me!! Lol!! Thanks to you both Joe and Ben!! You guys took care of me and got me what I needed. I'd go here to get coffee every time!! I had the Americano and it jolted me back to life. Phone was charged up and I was ready to go. The little things matter.
Mazarine Coffee,Nice little coffee shop located in the heart of financial district. This place is always packed but worth a trip if you're in the area.
Mazarine Coffee,"The food is great, not too long of a wait. We had the bacon grilled cheese, ham egg and cheese toast, avacado bacon and cheese toast, and a croissant"
Mazarine Coffee,"Bugger me! The price includes tax! What's next? The metric system? $3 Brazil (Klatch roasters) drip coffee was worthy of word wankery; earthy, molassesy, chocolatey, pixie dust. Coffee 5. Service 5. Atmosphere 5. Value 5. WiFi ✔️ (Google auto trusted WiFi, too)."
Mazarine Coffee,Most unorganized coffee place in the city. Opens and closes whenever. Turnaround time is forever. Coffee is ok.
Mazarine Coffee,"Really great place. They have awesome coffee, and a nice little terrace where you can sit and work in the sun. Unfortunately, they do not have wifi."
Mazarine Coffee,"Decent pricy coffee, nice toasts, convenient location. Love the earthenware mugs. Not so keen on the hard seating and the lack of power outlets."
Mazarine Coffee,"Avocado toast barely has any avo on it. Staff seems a tad unfriendly, as if they're doing you an unwanted favour. Good coffee though."
Mazarine Coffee,Easily one of the best breakfasts I’ve had in my life
Mazarine Coffee,"Good coffee but nothing special. Not the best coffee shop in town, would recommend going to Sightglass or Blue Bottle before coming here."
Mazarine Coffee,"The place is conveniently located. The desserts and coffee are great, you can also stop here for a quick bite for breakfast or lunch. Service is quick."
Mazarine Coffee,Very nice staff and decent coffee. Prices were not to hefty for San Francisco.  Will definitely stop here again.
Mazarine Coffee,"Pretty solid quality, good coffee and tasty toasts, though a bit expensive (which one still could expect for the location). Interior is modern and friendly."

Mazarine Coffee,"I had the iced latte and avocado/chicken/bacon toast, both very yummy. Great location with lots of seating."
Mazarine Coffee,"Use to be much better, now doesn't have wifi, people spending all day at all the tables not eating or getting coffee so no seating. Snacks are overpriced(but on par for the fidi)"
Mazarine Coffee,"Perfect brunch place. Avocado, egg, matcha options are amazing. Not a lot of seating for large groups."
Mazarine Coffee,"Superb coffee.  The avocado toast was a perfect combination of creamy cheese,  radish,  and avocado. Perfect place for a light bite."
Mazarine Coffee,"Awesome cold brew (it looks like a Guinness!), good waffles and smoked salmon toast. Particularly nice bathrooms for a coffee shop."
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious coffee, one of the best in the city, at San Francisco prices of course. :)"
Mazarine Coffee,Good food but way too small portions. The toast options all are pretty good limited seating but good outdoors watching
Mazarine Coffee,"Tiny dainty servings that shouldn't cost even $6 priced at $8 and $9. I only went to meet a friend after work, will avoid a repeat."
Mazarine Coffee,This place is always bustling with people but somehow I can always get a seat! Avocado toast is amazing. Mmmm my mouth is watering thinking about it.
Mazarine Coffee,Probably the best coffee in this part of the city. There can be a little wait during busy periods but well worth it.

Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious toasts, combination of avocado toast with ricotta toast is the greatest. Best avocado toast in the city. Great coffee"
Mazarine Coffee,Had to try the fancy toast. I wasn't expecting much but it was really delicious. It's basically an amazing open face breakfast sandwich.
Mazarine Coffee,Initial sip was a bit on more bitter side of life as it can be sometimes. Coffee wasn't too bad overall. A bit pricey to me though but I guess that's what it's like here.
Mazarine Coffee,A bit on the expensive side but I think a breakfast as early as 8 am in that area was a pleasant surprise.  Di try their waffles and veggie - bacon frittata

Mazarine Coffee,"Very welcoming staff, lots of power so you can work here, free wifi.  Food is really yummy and the coffee is excellent!"
Mazarine Coffee,"No Wi-Fi? Is this a joke? Again and again, SF proves to have the worst coffee shops in America. No Wi-Fi, closes at 5pm. It's really a joke and I'll never give them my business."
Mazarine Coffee,Mediocre coffee. Seriously Not worth the reviews. And the croissant tasted likes Starbucks croissant. Not terrible but not fantastic.
Mazarine Coffee,Good food and location
Mazarine Coffee,Australian standard coffee with nice toast options.
Mazarine Coffee,Drove out of our way to get coffee here! One of the best cups I've ever had. They absolutely know what they're doing.

Mazarine Coffee,"I tend to visit local cafes, but I came in because it was close to where I had brunch. I was worried because there is Gibraltar and there is also my own blend. I think American coffee tastes pretty good. The atmosphere is moderately cozy and quiet! Unless you're sitting next to a customer who is fiddling with the mouse."
Mazarine Coffee,"We ate breakfast at this cafe on our last day in San Francisco as we were staying in the area and read good reviews about it. It is spacious, has an outdoor terrace and a good variety of toasts and bowls for breakfast, among other things. Very good presentation and taste. We ordered 2 lattes and 2 toasties, one with ricotta and fresh fruits and one with egg and avocado. Good value for money compared to other places in the area. Recommendable."
Mazarine Coffee,"Unfortunately the avocado toast with eggs wasn't as good as expected. The boiled eggs were too runny for our taste and the toast lacked that certain something. (In San Jose, on the other hand, the avocado toast was perfect) But the cappuccino was positive, it also tasted very good here."
Mazarine Coffee,"I found and visited cafes with high ratings near the hotel. It's a local coffee shop in San Francisco, and I drank it at a different place every day. I ordered a cappuccino and it was fine. The milk froth was well made and the coffee beans had a pretty clean aftertaste. However, I often heard during this trip that the level of coffee in Korea has improved considerably. I personally give it a 4.5"
Mazarine Coffee,"I don't know if it's worth it, but the unsatisfying avocado and egg toast was $10. When I say toast, it's just a thick slice of bread."
Mazarine Coffee,"It's right on the market, just steps away from Powell station and easy to get to. There are a lot of people during the daytime, so it is recommended to go early or stagger the time. Coffee is very good. Macchiato is very rich, and if you like it, it comes with carbonated water. If you don't like strong coffee, I recommend the latte. The toast was a little hard and hard to eat. The color is nice and fashionable, but the taste is normal."
Mazarine Coffee,"American coffee seems to be darker roasted Not quite right... · But on this last morning in San Francisco, I finally met someone I like! Is it because the clerks are all Japanese that they can make the right coffee? Haha🤔 · The salsa avocado toast was also good (albeit a small portion) It’s a bit of a shop to meet late 😂 The light I just met is also great~"
Mazarine Coffee,Very nice and absolutely good and high quality food! Great cafe! Not cheap but totally worth the money.
Mazarine Coffee,"It is very convenient to be near Dingdang Station. The sidewalks on the street are very wide, and the seats at the door can bask in the sun, which is very popular. The coffee is delicious. There are many office workers at noon, feeling the daily life."
Mazarine Coffee,"First of all, I thought I wouldn't be disappointed when I saw the line waiting for the order, but as expected 👍🏻👍🏻two thumbs up! Personally, I don't like sour coffee, but the coffee here was good because it didn't have acidity. I recommend the real toast menu. I also wanted to try figs and strawberry toast. I was full and couldn't eat...."
Mazarine Coffee,"Absolutely delicious! The egg on the toast is perfect! Very friendly staffs.  The toast is delicious, especially with eggs! very friendly staff"
Mazarine Coffee,"very good espresso coffee, albeit very expensive. many people drink their coffee and use the cafe to work."
Mazarine Coffee,"The espresso is terrible, it's like drinking rancid lemon. For $5 I expected more"
Mazarine Coffee,The place is very comfortable. Coffee and food are very well prepared. The prices are high and the attention is very impersonal.
Mazarine Coffee,"I went twice in 3 days! The signature menu, Raf, was delicious, and the toast was also delicious."
Mazarine Coffee,"This place is simple and does not look like much. His coffee makes us travel the world, the small dishes that we can eat are simple for us Europeans. All that to say a place to frequent to find vegetal, French or Italian European type dishes in the design. The prices are very reasonable for San Francisco. Welcome at the top by the little young"
Mazarine Coffee,Really delicious! Recommended for breakfast
Mazarine Coffee,"A cafe with good access on Market Street. However, that is both an advantage and a disadvantage, and it is crowded from the morning, so the first to get a seat wins. Some people are working on a computer, but it's not very calm.  By the way, coffee is delicious! I think it's within the top three in San Francisco. This is recommended for those who like drip coffee. Only four barrel and blue bottle surpass this."
Mazarine Coffee,"The only place in San Francisco where we can sit down to have breakfast without the typical Starbucks and American fast food rush. WHAT a nice cafe to sit, relax and enjoy a cappuccino. Highly recommend!"
Mazarine Coffee,Excellent option for breakfast! The toasts are very rich and varied.
Mazarine Coffee,"Delicious breakfast, but the place is very small"
Mazarine Coffee,A trendy cafe. Recommended for breakfast in downtown.
Mazarine Coffee,"Excellent coffee, good choice of food for breakfast. Only that it was very crowded, you have to queue and that slows down the delivery"
Mazarine Coffee,It was a bit salty because of the addition of bacon. unique and delicious It seems to be a place frequented by local office workers.
Mazarine Coffee,"Food ok but not cheap. Sitting outside isn't that great now, you could bring in a little more heart."
