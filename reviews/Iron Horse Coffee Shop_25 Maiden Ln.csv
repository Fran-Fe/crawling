Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Hidden gem in downtown SF for a great coffee. I tried the iced rose latte, half sweet with oat milk recently and found it to be very well balanced. The coffee itself tasted super smooth, and not too sweet. The hidden spot in the nice alley is a great touch, steps from Union square. Strongly recommend!"
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Very nice place in downtown, quiet area, great coffee and pastries. My new favorite spot. Highly highly recommend it."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Super sweet spot for a coffee and a tasty. I tried Chai Latte the last time and loved it. I was also in need of a quiet spot for my virtual meeting and this place has super mellow music playing. Just what I needed!

Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Perfectly located, rare outdoor seating in a pleasant spot. Delicious espresso, tasty treats, friendly folks. A step above chain store coffee with a heap of added cool."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Great coffee and friendly baristas at a reasonable price 🙂 …
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Thank you very much, Ash, for your review.   Marina GM"
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Phenomenal coffee. ATM inside but they accept cards. Mainly a to-go coffee spot, however they have about 10 bar stools along a counter so you can sit and rest your legs if needed."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Cute little spot, yummy coffee. Ill be coming back to support!"
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Friendly service and decent coffee (they serve Ritual) - a little overpriced ($5.70 for an almond iced latte) but I guess that's what comes with a spot in this cute downtown lane!
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Iron Horse Coffee is a tiny coffee shop tucked in a lane in the Financial District. It started as a cocktail and still is in the evenings. Now they have a coffee shop that opens in the morning.  There's wall seating inside and a few tables outside in the lane.  My latte was rich and creamy, but they forgot to put out sugar.  If you want a decent cup of coffee, this is a good spot."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Cozy and nice place, tasty coffee, excellent service"
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Some mornings, I just need coffee! This is kind of hidden in a little alley way, but is luckily super close to my work so I just stopped by. Iron Horse is super small – more for a grab and go kind of place. The have a pretty small menu as well and 2 tall tables if you can grab one. I got the latte and it cost me a San Francisco price of almost $5! I was one of the few customers so the barista made it pretty quick. They use Verve coffee and it was really good. TBH, I don’t know much about the coffee, but I really liked the flavor of it and it wasn’t too bitter as I didn’t need to add more sugar.  Overall, it was a good cup of coffee to start my morning, but I need to be careful as these cups of coffee can really add up!"
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"A welcome and refreshing stop on an urban hike.  Friendly staff and great coffee.  We were attracted by an intriguing sign reading, ""Coffee That Doesn't Suck"" - I mean, who can resist that?  They sign was right; it didn't. We'll stop there again."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Nice coffee bar! I love it ❤️ Will come back soon 🌟
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Not a good cappuccino. The review is for the cappuccino. Ritual coffee.  Sour coffee and too much milk.  Tossed it in the bin after walking out. No decaf available. Nowhere to sit other than barstools inside and a few tables out in the rain.
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Great coffee (Ritual Roasters) off the beaten path. Tucked in the side of the entrance to the Romper Room, the baristas here are usually very welcoming and friendly, and I rarely have to wait in line (which is rare for 3rd wave coffee in the FiDi)."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,The coffee spot is open again! And the coffee they serve is delicious!
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Thank you very much, Victor, for your wonderful review. We are very excited to re-open our coffee shop… and We are looking forward to welcoming all of our old and new customers.  Marina GM"
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"It's has a great selection of coffee. Even for the indecisive one like me, they picked the perfect coffee combo for me. Staff is very cheerful and helpful."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Top notch coffee.  Roughly on par with Mazarine or Coffee Cultures, it's some of the best you can get in the area. Only? serves Ritual. Open from ? to about 3:30 during work days."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"I ordered an 8oz flat white, but I didn't get much coffee flavour because mostly what I was tasting was warm milk."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"Quality of the coffee is high by American standards, but has a long way to go to make it against 'real coffee' standards. Not much of a wait and works for a coffee hit that isn't total crap."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Delicious boozy coffee and pastries
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Their motto: Coffee that doesn't suck. Small but friendly coffee bar in a space that normally is a bar. Cool vibe.
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Very small coffee bar hidden halfway down the lane. Best mocha I've had during my vacation in San Francisco.
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"It was a good coffee stop.  But it would be nice if there was some additional tables outside, in the morning."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Quick and strong!
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Great place to get great coffee!
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,i like this place. secluded away from traffic heavy kearney street. nice place to enjoy afternoon coffee.
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,"For the area, it's ""Coffee that doesn't suck.""  With that sad, walk a bit further north, east, or north east - and you can probably get a better, cheaper cup of joe."
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Great small bar with very friendly staff. Coffee quality is great
Iron Horse Coffee Shop,Small spot with outdoor seating and a good selection of coffee (including liquor add-ons).
