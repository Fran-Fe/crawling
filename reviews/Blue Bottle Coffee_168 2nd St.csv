Blue Bottle Coffee,"What's not to love about Blue Bottle? Great coffee, excellent pastries and sandwiches and friendly service. Love the atmosphere here too, and if you have a dog, there's some complimentary treats for them in the back area. 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Seems so be as low waste as possible and I love that. The lattes were tasty and cutely presented, the building was nice and warm on this cold, rainy day, and the staff were extremely kind and helpful. The cashier that took my order was exceptionally sweet, making cheery conversations and flashing a huge smile. I didn’t get their name, but they appeared to be femme-presenting, wore glasses, and had dark hair tied into a bun. They were so nice, made my day. Thanks, whoever you are!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Easily one of the best spots to get coffee first thing.  The line up isn't terrible provided they're fully staffed. It can be a good 10 minutes wait if they're running behind.  The serene and minimalist decor has an open warm feeling and many tables to sit at.  Large windows helps the light in and keep things bright.  The coffee itself is great.  I've enjoyed the sweet latte, flat white, and their cookies.  What I enjoyed the most about the sweet latte, it's not this sugary overdose concoction pretending to be a coffee.  It is balanced and the brightness of the coffee is still tasted till the last drop.  The flat white is a bit on the bright acidic side but not too much to overwhelm and be your first cup to enjoy either.  It is expensive but it's the only place that gives a great cup consistently."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee and good vibes. Had a hot caffé latte with oat milk and a ham and cheese baguette sandwich. Sandwich was pretty tasty despite the bread being a bit tough. An option to warm it up would have been great. Overall, I had a good experience at this Blue Bottle Coffee. Will definitely be back to try the pastries next time I'm around."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Delicious coffee with friends! Definitely the most chocolatey mocha I’ve ever had, especially in this cruel world where mochas are not chocolatey enough. Love!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Can't go wrong at blue bottle. Sad they closed the one near the courthouse? They had food. This location did not. Just pastries
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Ordered hot chocolate, hojicha latte, avocado toast, waffle and the lemon poppy seed loaf. The hot chocolate was good but the hojicha latte was cold and didn’t have any caramel flavour. The lemon poppy seed loaf had subtle flavours and was very tasty. The waffle and a avocado toast were decent too"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The location is adorable and inviting. It really drew me in.  I'll preface this by saying that I drink plain black coffee and I don't think that is what this place specializes in. That said, NEVER order anything involving regular coffee from this place. I am not exaggerating at all when I say it was the worst cup of coffee I've ever tasted in my fairly long life.  It had just a slight burnt flavor, so the problem was with the beans, not the roasting or the brewing. It was extremely bitter with an aroma of urine and mold.  This place has such potential but the coffee is truly vile."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really nice staff and great seating areas. You can walk through the sales force park and take the elevator down to come here too :). Really good oat milk cappuccino, they froth it perfectly!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Matcha Latte and oat milk latte are consistently good! Unfortunately I didn't quite like the waffle because it was soggy.  Pro tip: Order ahead online to avoid the line.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The coffee shop itself is beautiful.   It is large w high callings & huge windows so if you crave natural light for your soul , reading, writing or working - this is a place for you. It is simple yet inviting & chic.  The oat milk latte for my taste was not hot enough....did I say anything? I didn't because I was block away & didnt want to come back but luckewarm  latter doesn't taste good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I love blue bottle aesthetic. They are so exceedingly pretty that their decor reminds me of superb embalmment . Maybe this is a mortuary? In that case it should buy the empty building next door and convert it to a cemetery ; this makes for a great vertically integrated business.  Did you know this Blue Bottle branch charges you for sugar.  They feel their coffee is naturally sweet ; they feel a right to fine you if you request sugar.  Subsequently,  they make sure you tip them for fining you.  I decided to pay them by bitcoin"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee as usual (blue-bottle-like). The service was really nice. I especially like the atmosphere of the store, pretty quiet! The restroom was clean. Great place to work and read."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Feel let down by this branch, partly because the others have been so good. Great coffee still but very unfriendly and helpful staff. Helping a customer with an allergy through the menu (which has no ingredients listed) is clearly something this team do not think is important."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I liked the place but I think it’s overhyped.  I stopped their on my way to work for my morning espresso and cappuccino. Cappuccino was good , both coffee and foam. Espresso was not impressive at all. I know that many people value blue  bottle for the drip coffee , but neither cappuccino nor espresso impressed me. The pastry was good but nothing special.  At least fresh. But nothing to remember. Service was friendly It’s nice cafe to get a cup of coffee or espresso for breakfast , spend time checking news , but I did not feel any excellence what many people talk about the blue bottle"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"some connoisseur coffee chain for those coffee connoisseurs out there.  you can find some funky stuff there that's pretty good. think there's a new single origin bean every month that's usually pretty special - the Ethiopian bean was unique in a pretty way, shout-out to that African continent!  food is bland as it tends to be in these chains. croissant dry, avocado toast overpriced.  gotta stay loyal to those iced philtered souls by the homie philz tho, so can't say it's my thing."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Love blue bottle coffee But this location, They didn't ask milk options for me. I ordered cafe latte, and got soy latte."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hey John, thanks for leaving a review! We'd love to get more info on your experience. If you'd like, please feel free to get in touch at support@bluebottlecoffee.com. Happy to help!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I always get the oat milk cappuccino and it's always delightful. This most recent trip I got a cat drawn in my milk. Wonderful!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"☕ 5. 🥐 5. 💁4. WiFi 4. 🪑 5. Modern, high-quality, consistent. Not a meal cafe - pastries, baguette sandwiches. …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Coffee was really good. Thanks for making my morning refreshing 😊
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Favorite coffee, favorite location! The staff is always amazing and professional! Even when it’s very busy coffee and service is on point!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,It’s so hard to find decent espresso based coffee shops in SF these days. Blue bottle has been the most consistent. Love the team here.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"We didn’t have much time to sit and enjoy the beautifuly decorated cafe but it was still a great time. I ordered New Orleans on the menu. It was utterly delicious. It was that good that when I drink at Starbucks, I really regret drinking and buying this. Maybe it is a bit pricy compared to Starbucks. BUT It is definitely worth it. I can also say that the restroom was pretty clean. They gave you a passcode when you ask for it. So no one can simply go in. It is environment friendly because there are glasses for the tap water. I know this is a very little detail but these matter. In conclusion I recommend going to drink quality coffee.  *you can see from the picture that i couldn’t wait to take a proper pic because it was too good to wait."
Blue Bottle Coffee,This is the nicest blue bottle I have ever been too. All of their cups and napkins are compostable or in house cutlery and plates are made for long term use. The baristas are always so nice and professional doing their most to make sure every interaction is special. Huge shoutout to Michael and AJ.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I'll be the first to say that the Customer Service here was great! After buying Blue Bottle's very own Eco Friendly Melamine Free Mug I saw the cup had some dust at the top, yuk. I asked the friendly lady in the front for any newer mugs available but said she didn't have any; I think they should at least keep some in the bag somewhere in the back. Anyways. The staff politely cleaned the cup for me. The best part was that the staff came out to clean the whole entire shelf which made me feel a lot better about buying there product's in the future. The blonde made my coffee and put fourth great energy, smiles, and she's good with timing also as I was 5min late. Worth It. Go Blue!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Seasonal matcha ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Bathroom code 25251
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great experience with coffee latte!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Super loud and not friendly reception. Would not recommend.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Amazing Blue Bottle cafe in downtown San Francisco. Highly recommended ✌🏼
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great location! Ordering was nice and easy and the food was great. I had the toast with jam and the New Orleans iced coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,My favorite location. Love the staff. Really professional and problem solvers. They missed my mobile order and immediately worked on it. Then offered me a free drink on my next visit. The coffee is also consistent no matter which location I go to.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Oat milk cappuccino was terrific!
Blue Bottle Coffee,☕ Hipsters slapping wonderful coffee beans from around the world into beautiful lattes and pour overs.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Un-pretentious coffee place. A good stab at an English breakfast tea. Post exercise eats and headroom for days. Take a deep breath and ahhhh... relax.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really good coffee, and the Everything Pull Apart bun will be my new craving! Friendly staff and clean space to boot!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I am trying to find the words to describe Blue Bottle Coffee, but if I had only one word: EXCELLENT! Great store vibe, sustainable and fair trade conscious so give it try. If you love coffee as much as I do I do not think you will be disappointed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee, pour over not fast food. Not over roasted lukewarm drip. Hot. fresh, and good quality beans. $5 for standard cupsize."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Amazingly good espresso (I'm Italian), great scones and cookies!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Not overhyped. Normally, if I order an espresso, it’s just a way to get caffeine asap. Here, I actually ENJOY it??"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Even though it's under a big corporation, the San Francisco locations haven't lost their small craft vibe"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great service, delicious coffee"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Delicious iced drinks. The cold brew is pretty bitter (more than others nearby like Equator), but it has great fruity notes that, when cut with a little simple syrup, really shine.  Definitely recommend for a work coffee break or short chat. Not great for doing work since it's a little too busy."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Coffee was way overpriced, but yes, it was good. Took far too long to come to me. They wouldn't ( couldn't!???) warm my $5 chocolate croissant, so it was stale and the chocolate inside was solid.  I won't go again."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for visiting! We'd love to hear any other feedback you have about your visit, please get in touch at support@bluebottlecoffee if we can assist! Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Consistent coffee across the San Francisco cafes - worth the wait in the queue if you find yourself there at peak time. The macchiato to go is the equivalent of an Aussie piccolo which I find hard to get anywhere - thanks for keeping me fuelled during my stay!
Blue Bottle Coffee,You can't visit San Francisco without visiting this classic coffeeshop. The New Orleans Cold Brew is amazing.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best espresso in the area. Waffles highly recommended too!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Their shaken espresso was delicious.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Coffee is good & the staff is friendly, I wouldn’t recommend if you’re uneducated, dumb & think latte art is what makes a good cup of coffee.  As a specialty coffee barista, I say to you peeps out there. Starbucks is always an option☺️"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The latte was so good here! I loved the atmosphere, it was calming and I felt like you could work here for a bit if you needed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The food is really good, don’t get me wrong. I love their drinks and food. But I just couldn’t believe how slow they are. I ordered 3 toasts and 1 drink, waited 30 mins on it. It’s unbelievable"

Blue Bottle Coffee,A nice cupnof coffee that had a good flavour. I would definitely recommend them. Their waffle is really good.
Blue Bottle Coffee,The last thing we needed was another chain coffee shop. There are literally dozens of solid options in the vicinity. Why give money to Nestle when you don’t have too? :)
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really nice but somewhat expensive coffee. Not my favorite in SF, but top 3"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I've been all over the world searching for the best coffee and I must say this is some of the best you will find in SF
