Cafe New Honolulu,"It was an authentic Hong Kong restaurant. Clean, quiet, and most importantly, delicious. I just took rice with steamed pork, and this simple cuisine tasted amazing. The rice was cooked perfectly, and the amount of rice they gave is more than enough to fill one's stomach. Price was also reasonable. Highly recommend."
Cafe New Honolulu,"This was THE best Asian food I've had EV-ER! Very delicious and authentic, in my book."
Cafe New Honolulu,"Airy, high ceilinged Chinatown quick serve, a great option for a Hong Kong-style lunch or snack.  Shredded pork and salted vegetable noodle soup (with wonton add-on) had a flavorful funk, very filling for under $10.  Meets the Chinatown standard where the bar set for Cantonese cooking is high. But not uniquely set apart from the many yummy options in the neighborhood."
Cafe New Honolulu,This place was great! It was a bit chilly outside so we all ordered soups. The one in the picture is the wonton soup. It was $7.25. It was a great price for the amount of soup I received. It was like a never ending bowl. Very tasty. The workers were friendly. 🍲🍜 …
Cafe New Honolulu,"Tasty food for affordable price that hits the spot when your looking for fried rice and noodles. Your basic no frills Hong Kong style cafe that serves stir fry noodles, congee, cheung fun, coffee and milk tea etc.  Only one waitress for the entire restaurant, she was nice albeit, poor lady running around the whole time.  Food came out in reasonable amount of time."
Cafe New Honolulu,"Cafe New Honolulu is located next to my old Chinese language school, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall. This is a Hong Kong style cafe and does not have Hawaiian food on the menu. My first impression of this restaurant was how big the dining room was. It was modern and sort of clean. I was skeptical of their authenticity because of it. But, during my meal, the kitchen staff rolled the big Recology garbage cans through the dining room and out the front door. This confirms that it is an authentic Chinese restaurant.  I had their baked pork chop spaghetti $11. It was OK. It didn't have that deep tomato taste and the spaghetti was too moist. Pork chops tasted fine but the color was off. The noodles broke apart when I used my fork on it. Given that it took over 30 minutes for this dish to come out, I would not order this if I'm in a hurry. If you are worried about your parking meter or garage tab, the food wait time will push it over. There were only two parties eating. Slow kitchen. Washington Bakery used to be my favorite HK style cafe in Chinatown. They are no longer in business."
Cafe New Honolulu,"I loved their Walnuts and prawns, the cream was so tasty and the walnuts so crunchy! The noodles were really good too, I'll definitely stop by again!!!😋"
Cafe New Honolulu,xO Flavoring is very good .. & I would return again. It’s not quite a 4 & should b 3.75. The noodles & the cheung fun was a little bit overdone. I don’t mind eating it mushy but their flavoring is very tasty
Cafe New Honolulu,Wanted a bite to eat from a local spot. Had beef fried rice. Service was a bit slow but the food was excellent. Price was reasonable for a downtown location.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Great place! Great tasting food! It was nice to taste authentic Chinese food from the San Francisco's own China Town! Bathrooms were dirty that's why I give it a 4/5. If you decide to come here, just bring cash. That's the only kind of payment they accept."
Cafe New Honolulu,"Their Thing Kong style milk tea is so good, hot or cold. Very rich of tea flavor not bitter and creamy. Highly recommend. For the hot one, they o my out tea and condensed milk, for me personally I like it sweeter, so I usually asa another half bag of sugar.  The baked  pork chop over rice was so good, large portion too. 2 pieces if pork chops over some egg fried rice, with tomato sauce on top! Wish they add some corn to the rice, a sunny side up egg on top, and some cheese? That would make it perfect.  The rice noodle is very plain, no d of thick too, will not get it again.  They close on Monday. It would get busy during breakfast and lunch hours."
Cafe New Honolulu,Omg! We finally found a great place to have black peppered beef like we had in China. This was really outstanding and I highly recommend it. Delicious boba tea too.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Go-to place for baked pork chop over rice! Huge portion for the price and delicious. We always get an extra to go. The flavor is great; my husband says it’s very nostalgic of his childhood in HK. Worth the trek up the hill from Grant!! First pic is the to-go portion, second shows all the goodness midway through devouring! So yummy!"
Cafe New Honolulu,"We ordered the beef noodle soup and the wonton noodle soup, both of which are delicious!! If I had to pick one over the other, I would pick the beef noodle soup. The service isn't great unless you're Cantonese or if you know the owners, but that is pretty generalized throughout Chinatown. This place is definitely worth visiting, especially with the affordable prices. Complementary tea comes with all meals."
Cafe New Honolulu,Well we need for dinner because this food & drink is great and both noodle soups are not so bad 4.9 out of 5 stars and also great price 21.20 well take it.
Cafe New Honolulu,"American Chinese menu. Some menu examples are congee, noodles, fried rice, clay pots, fried chicken, rice plates, won ton, baked spaghetti plates, etc. Food is served temperature hot and good portions."
Cafe New Honolulu,"Don't be fooled by the name, great Asian food. I have eaten a delicious Singapore Style Vermicelli, and drank Cold Hong Kong style tea. Food options at Chinatown may be overwhelming, they have many many options. If you haven't check places ahead of your visit, go straight to this place. You won't regret it."
Cafe New Honolulu,"The huge portion noodle and soup bowls make this a wonderful option in Chinatown.  A place where the locals eat.  Fresh, delicious and quick, this is a new main eating location for me. I had Broccoli and tenderloin Meiji sauce and it was awesome, but the true winner was my wife's beef stew noodle soup.  She ate that up in minutes.  I tried and highly recommend. Service was fine, took our order, brought food quick, no complaints, but no outstanding service expectations when you arrive.  You should be here for the food anyway. Fyi, cash only."
Cafe New Honolulu,This place has the absolute best Chinese food I have ever tasted! They have great service the waitstaff and cook are all amazing!!
Cafe New Honolulu,Really yummy food. So authentic. Really big and spacious restaurant too! Cash only so don't forget to hit the ATM down the street before sitting down to eat here.
Cafe New Honolulu,Service only wish to serve to chinese speakers. Noone spoke english. Waitrist. Is racist. Gave me a half plate of food and overchsrge me. Worst place ever in sf in 15 years. Cash only.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Ok food, bigger portion, acceptable prices. Wonderful drink options. If you want hong kong style food and milk tea, this little cafe offers various choices."
Cafe New Honolulu,Picked up 4 dishes for dinner.  Taste average.  The one star was because I found a short piece of steel wool on my sticky rice!  I should have read the reviews first but it was getting late so I just picked this place for take out as it was on my way back to my hotel.  No wonder the first bite of the sticky rice tasted with a fainted cleaning solution.  Stay the hell away.
Cafe New Honolulu,Extremely mediocre food. Service was alright. Also they don’t accept card but they don’t tell you until you’re about to pay - what is this?
Cafe New Honolulu,i got the scrambled eggs with prawns- very disappointing. not tasty unfortunately and very dry.
Cafe New Honolulu,It's a decent place to eat Chinese food Hong Kong style in chinatown.  I had a hard time to order due to language problem. The price is higher compared with the the Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. The location is close to public transportation.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Good for Hong Kong style comfort food like porridge, brisket soup noodles, chow fun, chow mein and wonton soup. Restaurant is clean and they wipe down the tables after each meal. Noise level can be disturbing during peak hours, but after all, shut out the noise and enjoy."
Cafe New Honolulu,Nicest service value prices anddecent food
Cafe New Honolulu,No frills HK style cafe. Cash only and one woman working the hole floor so a little delay here and there but overall food comes out quick and delicious!
Cafe New Honolulu,This restaurant has the worst service I have ever seen.   The waitress doesn’t care at all about her customers.   I waited a long time to order and a long time to get my bill.   There is an elderly lady next to me who got up to look for a spoon herself after waiting a while.  The waitress walked out to buy ice cream for herself and the cook.  I saw them opening their wrappers and enjoying the ice cream while her customers sat.   How ridiculous is this!
Cafe New Honolulu,Try eating The Baked Seafood Over Rice 🦑🦐🐠🐡🍚
Cafe New Honolulu,"I ordered egg rolls and French fries.  The French fries were the best I've had in a long time.  They were not greasy, and were made from real potatoes!  They egg rolls come with a sweet red sauce and were also good. Both came to a total of 9 dollars. I'd go back again and try some other items!"
Cafe New Honolulu,Great and clean diner for a relaxing meal break on a busy day. Cash only. Solid comfort foot and please be respectful of the many locals that eat here.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Food is consistent,  price is reasonable, service is fast and friendly. One of the best chief from Vegas. Highly recommend for their authentic Chinese and HK style dishes. I eat breakfast, dinner at the restaurant 3 time per week. Very clean!"
Cafe New Honolulu,"Was recommended this restaurant for its noodles. It has variety of noodles and congee, the beef stew noodles is very good."
Cafe New Honolulu,"The service was just extremely bad! The server couldn't be more rude to the customers even when the restaurant was almost empty. SHE CAN'T BE ACTING LIKE SHE IS SO AGITATED EVERY-SINGLE-DAY OK! Overall the food was just ok, better to eat and spend money somewhere else instead.  I WILL NOT GO SPEND MY MONEY THERE AGAIN."
Cafe New Honolulu,"I suggest taking a pass on this.  It is not traditional Cantonese or Mandarin style food but more Polynesian.  The prices were average and so was the food and portion size.  BUT THE KICKER was we noticed an additional charge on our bill, I asked what the charge was and was told a tip.  The tip added was approximately 40% which was no where close to being earned or warranted given the food quality and service.  The restaurant itself looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years and you can smell the old cooking grease in the air.  I would say to stay clear of this place.  Visited on 4/15/2018"
Cafe New Honolulu,"Saw the pork buns from the window and we had to stop in.  Grabbed pork buns and sesame red bean balls, my guilty pleasure.  Both were amazing.  Didn't order off the menu.  The bakery items were solid and the perfect walking food for the China town hike."
Cafe New Honolulu,A truly old-school Hong Kong style cafe that had awesome milk tea sweetened with condensed milk. I recommend getting it half sweetened so you can really taste the black tea. I ordered the set breakfast which came with ham & macaroni in chicken broth along with a breakfast roll. It was good considering that it only cost me $5 for all the food.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Hong Kong style cafe food with an American twist, won ton noodles, club sandwiches, baked spaghetti, eggs and toast, milk tea & pineapple bun, etc etc. This place has been serving the same type of food for decades, though a change of owner, fresh paint and updated menu has been   made over the years, this place still draws the same Chinatown crowd. This place is very busy due to it's location. The quality of the food is so so, and the staff is ok depending on who's working that day, I've experienced alot of rude servers in the past and lost orders. The kitchen is a bit slow, pending the type of order. Try to stick with the typical Chinese cafe stuff or expect to wait."
Cafe New Honolulu,hong kong style milk tea and french toast is close to og flavours from hong kong itself
Cafe New Honolulu,"Normal food, the service is the worst. The lady who checked us in a hurry tended to take note of our menu. She pointed us where to look to go faster. The minute we bring the food they brought the bill. They charge tip without asking and got the change in bad ways. I do not recommend to anybody."
Cafe New Honolulu,the HK-style cafe tongo to in SF Chinatown & you won't be disappointed.
Cafe New Honolulu,Great food and reasonable price.
Cafe New Honolulu,If you love plain white rice and alot of it ...  cheese wonton?...cheeseless and hard....5 wing sections for $12...buyer beware.
Cafe New Honolulu,Both locals and tourists come here. I think it's one of the few places open past 6pm in Chinatown. The won ton noodle soup was fine. Beef stew in my noodle soup was tough.
Cafe New Honolulu,A nice spot for breakfast/brunch - ordered a bunch of stuff for under 40. Highly recommend the rice rolls.
Cafe New Honolulu,"super cheap and quality Chinese food!! best in Chinatown, must get the Chinese Rice Noodle!! authentic from south china"
Cafe New Honolulu,"Not particularly clean, noodle soup was ok, house special fried rice was very good except for the eggshells, siu Mai was good, sio bao were below average.  Bathrooms were disgusting."
Cafe New Honolulu,"I don't get it. The whole place is a bit of a mystery. Cafe Honolulu seems to have started as a Chinese restaurant (and you will find it in the heart of China Town), and then the chief decided he really liked Borscht. So he went ahead and stuck it on the menu. Later, he added Ice Cream Soda (which he decided to make with Sprite?). I settled for ordering Mongolian Beef, which seems like something you can get anywhere, and some kind of pepper pork chop. When that arrived, I took a cautious bite.  ""Is this the pork I ordered?"" The boy looked at the meat on my fork.  ""That's fish."" Turns out, it was fish. We got that one for free.  The place is oddly decorated, though the ceiling is neat. I just don't get it. The place was full to the brim with folks who looked like locals. It can't be a tourist trap, and yet I don't understand it. I need to go back to understand, and I don't really want to go back, not with the mass of places I haven't been yet.  If someone's willing to check it out for me and tell me what I missed, then I'll go again. But I don't think I missed anything.  Unless you're just stopping in the the bakery! Maybe that's the secret: for 70 cents you get a bun the size of my hand, full of bbq pork, egg custard, or other traditional delights. So, search your pockets for your change and go get a bun. Just don't pick up a menu.  Oh, and it's cash only. I had to resort to picking up the lunch tab with my fresh roll of laundry quarters I just got from the bank."
Cafe New Honolulu,Really nice place that serves Hong Kong some baked food n Cantonese confort food. Really inexpensive n clean. Service was good.
Cafe New Honolulu,Love this spot. Off the menu I recommend the baked beef with egg. When I'm in a rush I always stop for a steamed bun usually before work. The small ones are only 65 cents
Cafe New Honolulu,"1. They automatically ADD TIPS IN THE BILLS, and they only give you receipts write by hand which do not explain the tips added in bill , so do NOT GIVE THEM TIPS!!! 2. They calculated tips base on TAX! 3. Their service is sucks!!! They always ignore you! 4. The kitchen is SOOOO DIRTY! 5. As a Chinese, I am shame on them!!! They do not know what is service!!! 他们把小费加在账单里，而且用s-来表示，很多人都不会注意到这些并且给他们另算小费，而且服务态度极差，餐具肮脏  이식당가진마,더럽다"
Cafe New Honolulu,The food is average and the environment is not very pleasant.  The experience we had here was aweful! We were told it's cash only when we were about to check out. My partner had to walk to the bank to get cash to pay for the meal.
Cafe New Honolulu,This is my favorite Cantonese style breakfast food place for comfort food like congee and Chinese donuts.
Cafe New Honolulu,Visitors out of town wanted to eat some dim sum. Some of it was warm more cold not warm. Some was warmed up in the microwave and dried out. Others got served faster maybe because we were not majority.

Cafe New Honolulu,"If you're not too hungry to accept it, don't eat here, including milk tea, which is bland and tasteless. If you're not too hungry to accept it, don't eat here, including milk tea, which is bland and tasteless."
Cafe New Honolulu,"Good restaurant with popular prices. The menu has pictures which helps a lot. Unfortunately, a single person has to serve every table. So, you are in debt. It has few drink options."
Cafe New Honolulu,"You can eat ""real"" Chinese here. The restaurant gives the impression of a canteen. The menu is in Chinese and English. The operation can articulate in English. The food was delicious. Prices are average. You have to pay in CASH ONLY !!"
Cafe New Honolulu,We loved it! good deli seasoning
Cafe New Honolulu,"It’s the first time to eat Chinese food in the United States. In fact, the price and taste are not bad, but the portion is really big. You need to pay attention to the portion"
Cafe New Honolulu,"I ordered two dishes and two cups of milk tea in total. The store was very busy. I forgot to order one dish. After 3 reminders, I said it would be done. After waiting for 40 minutes, there was nothing. We were so angry that we canceled the payment and prepared to leave. When we finally paid, we thought about checking to see if it was done, but we still didn’t make it... There were many waiters, and the shop was not full. The service efficiency was really problematic. The food for the two people at the next table also waited for a long time. The milk tea tastes okay, but the beef brisket noodles are average."
Cafe New Honolulu,"We entered because of its clean appearance and reasonable prices, there were only local people and the authentic food, the fresh tea very interesting and good. We ate a soup, I was surprised by the flavor, the texture, different from what we are used to but better. The toilets are not so clean, the kitchen is open and it did seem clean. The girl attended us soon, yes it is true that she was only there to attend to the restaurant and the orders but she handled it well. You can only pay in cash!"
Cafe New Honolulu,"Not to mention the food, the service is really bad. There are 3 tables at the water bar, and I am at the door, politely waiting for me to sit down, and waiting for 5 minutes. He didn't even serve the menu at the bottom, so he walked past Li and asked me if I ordered Zuo Ye? I click hello sister. It was okay 2 months ago, but today the service is ridiculously poor."
Cafe New Honolulu,"The lobster + steak here is okay, although the taste is not very high-end, but it only costs $30. Checkout only accepts cash."
Cafe New Honolulu,Clean cafe with a good Chinese breakfast 👍 Friendly service
Cafe New Honolulu,"Very good food, fresh and good value for money!"
Cafe New Honolulu,"Spontaneous lunch with the family. Felt genuine and the food was good The three of us ate black pepper spaghetti, bbq pork and Peking pork chop Recommend going here."
Cafe New Honolulu,Very good food at very reasonable prices. All the best. It tasted very good and we liked it. The soups are also highly recommended.
Cafe New Honolulu,"Don't go!!!!!! The restaurant changed ownership, the food is alright, but when we check out it's cash only, but it was $28+, l didn't really pay attention, so l give them $60 instead $40, normally if you given them wrong amount of money they will give you back, but that woman didn't. After we went outside l realize that I gave her $60, she gave me $12 back. Which means she took the $20. 'm pretty sure about this because l check the money l left when I got home. So don't come to this place!!!!!!!!! They will take you money when you didn't realize. I went to this place today First of all, I don’t know that this restaurant has changed owners, so although the food is similar, the taste is not as good as the previous one. In addition, the most important thing is that I was distracted by other things during the checkout, so 28 I thought about paying 40 for the bill for the knife, but it turned out to be 60. Generally speaking, if you give it wrong, the clerk will return it to you directly, but the middle-aged woman who paid the bill for me didn’t. I didn’t realize something was wrong until I came out. I gave her 60, she gave me 12, I gave a total of three 20, there is no way she didn't realize that I gave the wrong money. This time I was unlucky and didn't pay attention, but all Chinese people are so tricked, who knows how many other people this store has cheated with this method. So tell everyone, don't go! do not go! do not go!"
Cafe New Honolulu,"It's not expensive and delicious here, Asians are not allowed"
Cafe New Honolulu,"The food is good, the service is OK, but the seats are quite crowded. However, the location is in Chinatown, so crowding is inevitable, but when it comes to parking... oh!"
Cafe New Honolulu,"The product is okay, the price is moderate~"
Cafe New Honolulu,"Small amount of food, average taste"
Cafe New Honolulu,"I went in the afternoon on 05/26/2022, the service is very bad now, no business, no help, no waitress, the boss should ask a half-worker to help the floor, and ruin the business by himself!!!!!"
Cafe New Honolulu,The sweet bread is absolutely delicious. The place is not pretty but its food invites you to return.
