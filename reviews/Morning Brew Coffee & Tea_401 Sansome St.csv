Mo'z Cafe,"Just ate ate there! Its so absolutely wonderful and worth it! Incredible service, food and atmosphere! Genuinely the best meal I’ve had in a very long time! Most wonderful sandwich and welcoming environment! Me and my mother had the Tuna melt and the Chicken parm sandwich (the latter is pictured below)  The only thing I will say is the portion sizes are good but a bit larger for someone just visiting the USA. Wonderful meal, would highly suggest going!"
Mo'z Cafe,They deliver excellent customer service. I’d say the best experience for dine-in at cafe in the US so far. I’m not the fan of burger and sandwich so I went with salmon scramble and fruit and the taste was marvellous!! The atmosphere is also comfy. I would definitely coming back to this place again when I visit SF.
Mo'z Cafe,Came here twice while chaperoning a student trip from Texas. Delicious food and amazing service! Definitely recommend. They were able to get more than 30 of us in and taken care of both deliciously and beautifully!
Mo'z Cafe,"Fast. Could be better with a full bar - love a Bloody Mary option :) Fresh squeeze juice right in front of me. Good coffee cake. I got the pancake combo. And although it’s s’posed to come with scrambled eggs, he let me modify to over medium. The latte was great, and served in a huge heavy mug - perfect alternative to the tiny cups or worst paper cups most places do these days.  Also, obsessed with the accuracy of ChatGPT. I asked to write a review for this place - super true: Mo'z Cafe is a cozy and charming breakfast and brunch spot located in the heart of San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood. The cafe has a warm and inviting atmosphere with a decor that exudes a chic and contemporary feel.  The menu at Mo'z Cafe offers a wide selection of breakfast and brunch items, including classic favorites like pancakes, French toast, and eggs Benedict, as well as more unique dishes like the ""Breakfast Sushi,"" which is a creative take on eggs and bacon presented in a sushi roll. All of the dishes are made with high-quality ingredients and are beautifully presented.  I particularly enjoyed the avocado toast, which was topped with perfectly ripe avocado, cherry tomatoes, and feta cheese, and served on a slice of artisanal bread. The coffee at Mo'z Cafe is also excellent, with a range of blends and brewing methods to choose from.  The service at Mo'z Cafe is friendly and attentive, with staff who are knowledgeable about the menu and happy to offer recommendations. The cafe can get quite busy during peak hours, but the wait times are usually reasonable, and it's worth it for the delicious food and cozy ambiance.  Overall, I highly recommend Mo'z Cafe for a relaxed and delicious breakfast or brunch experience in San Francisco. It's a great spot to enjoy a leisurely meal with friends or family, or to catch up on work while sipping a cup of coffee and enjoying a delicious meal."
Mo'z Cafe,Was so underwhelming! I had the beef hash! It was all potatoes and a hint of beef for $20. I even asked the guy if the amount of protein was sufficient and he said it is plenty and excellent. Typical American style. Loaded with carbs and little nutritious value.
Mo'z Cafe,"I loved their new burrito bowl. It made for a great breakfast filled with greens, beans, rice, and salsa. The coffee was awesome too. The perfect place to dine on your way to your flight out of SF."
Mo'z Cafe,Very nice breakfast place.  Service was wonderful. I had the the Fruity Nutella Crepe and my husband had oatmeal. Also got 2 smoothies. Lots of chopped ice so not really a smoothie- but tasty. My husband said the coffee was great.
Mo'z Cafe,Absolutely delicious food. And the owner is incredibly friendly and kind. We brought a huge group of students and he served them so quickly! Would definitely come again to try everything on the menu!
Mo'z Cafe,Best of the best .Big portions excellent food . I had a breakfast the pancakes was so fluffy. And the service 10/10 thanks a lot to Mohamed.
Mo'z Cafe,Fantastic food served hot and fresh. Got the corned beef hash and eggs and it's every bit as good as it looks.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great breakfast close to my hotel. - There's a little bit of everything here but the coffee is good, food tastes fresh and good, and the environment is nice."
Mo'z Cafe,Ate here a few times. Excellent breakfast place. Good coffee.
Mo'z Cafe,"I recently had a layover in San Francisco while traveling from Hawaii to Europe, and the stars aligned to bring me to Mo'z Cafe for a scrumptious brunch! Let me tell ya, it was a delightful gastronomic pit stop on my journey.  This cafe radiates good vibes all around, with its chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and mouthwatering menu. Though the queue was long, it only spoke volumes of the love people have for this gem of a place. No one minds waiting for something this amazing!  The food was simply divine, with each bite transporting me to brunch paradise. I could tell every dish was crafted with care, making it the perfect fuel for a long flight ahead. Mo'z Cafe is the embodiment of what brunch dreams are made of.  If you ever find yourself in San Francisco, don't miss out on this brunch haven. Trust me, it's worth every second of the wait! Can't wait for my next layover to indulge in the magic of Mo'z Cafe again. ✌️🥞🥓☕️🌉"
Mo'z Cafe,"Cute cafe in the middle of the city. Plenty of breakfast selection and friendly wait staff. Their corned beef hash is not bad. It has carrots which were a little off-putting, otherwise it was pretty decent. Note that it does say it in the menu item's description. Their regular iced coffee is decent as well. Wouldn't mind checking out their other menu items."
Mo'z Cafe,"The best!  The food was fantastic.  The menu is huge!  If I ate here every day for. Month, I think I'd still have things to try."
Mo'z Cafe,"This café embodies all the things I love. Salmon lox bagels, chocolate croissants, great coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice… Everything under one small roof and beautifully done. Excellent service and wonderful smiles."
Mo'z Cafe,"The breakfast burrito was very filling, I couldn't finish it! Coffee is really good and they have good brown cane sugar as well. I don't like that plates and cutlery are disposable plastics, but everything else was great!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great place for breakfast. Love the interior. Great quality food, drinks and unique choice! Great service."
Mo'z Cafe,"Great place to grub breakfast, service is excellent, food is also good"
Mo'z Cafe,"A lot of care goes into the food at Mo'z. The salmon scramble is amazing and even the coffee was wonderful. The service is fast and friendly, and it's just a relaxing place to start your day. Close to all the hotels around Union Square."
Mo'z Cafe,"Doesn't seem much. But the less the better right? Mo'z Pancake Combo special with a ice coffee , defently coming back! Super tasty and excelent for breakfest and brunch. Great prices! Filling dishes! The pancake was super fluffy and tasty, the sausage was a bit stiff but still tasty and for sure the dish is fulfiling. I think that some normal utensiles as knife and fork could be more comfy but still everything was great😁"
Mo'z Cafe,Love this place. My wife and I ordered the breakfast burrito and the croissant sandwich. The burrito has the right amount of jalapeno heat and my wife said she enjoyed the breakfast ham and cheese croissant. For the kids we ordered the Moz pancake combo with extra sausage. We split it between them and the portion was more than enough. They loved the pancakes. Fluffy and lightly sweet. It was their favorite meal of the vacation. Met the owner and he was so nice and accommodating. He came out and opened the door so we could get the stroller in. He checked on us multiple times. You can tell he cares about his business and wants it to thrive. Please come support this cafe.
Mo'z Cafe,"This place is amazing!!!  Here on business, walked in, staff was freaking awesome!  Fresh squeezed OJ, healthy food...if you travel for business, you understand how much I appreciated this restaurant.   Please give the place your business!"
Mo'z Cafe,"After wondering a lot and getting frustrated fr all the closed restaurants everywhere (very sad actually) I found this place, nice and clean, with a big veraiety of foods, only thing botherede was the price for my salad - 19$, it was a large dish I have to admit though"
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent breakfast. I was on a limited diet and they cooked up eggs just to meet my requirements. Big smiles and happy to have us in the restaurant. The restroom was clean and everything felt just really like a nice place to be.
Mo'z Cafe,Loved this place! The staff was so friendly and treated us like family. My husband and I shared these two meals pictured below. Everything was delicious and we already can’t wait to come back!
Mo'z Cafe,They do a decent breakfast and cafe au lait. Friendly staff and quiet dine-in if one arrives early.
Mo'z Cafe,The food is ok but the presentation on paper plate and plastic cutlery to eat is very disappointing. And the price really crazy $70.00 for 2 burrito a sausage and two large coffee.
Mo'z Cafe,"Wow! Always look for a place other than the hotel I'm in. What a fine fit breakfast. I can only imagine what the sandwiches are like. Mo'z pancake combo and eggs bene were prefect! Fruity Nutella crepes finished off and awesome breakfast...got it to go. A berry blast w/acai🙄 to walk out down. Sorry no close up picture of the sticky bun and chocolate croissant only the case (top 2nd from rt/bottom left) at I ate them there. Get them!  Day 2 French toast, berry blast, sticky bun and fruity Nutella crepes"
Mo'z Cafe,"My favorite breakfast spot in SF. The bagels are delicious, crunchy, slightly chewy, and bite perfectly. The consistency of the food is top notch - it’s always delicious. The owner works there every day and you can tell he really loves the the place.  He is genuinely friendly and welcoming, and his attitude and tasty food make a great start to the day for anyone who stops by."
Mo'z Cafe,"horrible food, oversugared smoothies, i'd go somewhere else if i was you"
Mo'z Cafe,"Breakfast burrito was alright, it lacked flavor, and meat, I definitely wouldn’t recommend for $20. Should have been $12 max. Beans were good. Staff was very friendly. If I ever came here again I would try something else. Overpriced here but so is all of SF."
Mo'z Cafe,It was pretty expensive and mediocre food. My husband and I didn't like what we got. Pancakes were a bit like rubber. But they offer plenty of different breakfast specials. Maybe other food is better.
Mo'z Cafe,We were looking for some cafe to eat but found this. We entered into this clean place. The service was the best part because the food was served quick and when I asked to warm my drink he made it perfectly hot. The menu items were filled up. It was a great experience overall.
Mo'z Cafe,Went here for breakfast. Thought the food was overpriced for what you got. Ordered the French toast and it only came with 4 half slices and was $20. No sides included. Not worth the cost. Had a way better breakfast at Lapisara.
Mo'z Cafe,"Don‘t get fooled by the cute exterior. Low quality food for very expensive prices. For example, the smoothie is not done fresh - they use premade and just add ice to it. Breakfast bagel gave us both belly aches. Regret it."
Mo'z Cafe,Overall.okay. only one vegan option (oatmeal).
Mo'z Cafe,"One of the best places to eat, breakfast, brunch and lunch. Everything is good, I really enjoy the corned beef hash. With a Thai Iced tea. 10/10 will be coming back."
Mo'z Cafe,"Quaint atmosphere, friendly fast service and good quality food  really can’t ask for much more. The screwdriver was made with freshly squeezed orange juice which was a very nice touch."
Mo'z Cafe,Nice place to eat quickly. We were on our way to a meeting at PG&E and this was right up the street. Close to Powell st Bart. I would go here again. The service was fast and friendly and it tasted like something I would make at home. Not overly fancy just good. I had the Mo’z pancake combo. My only complaint is I would have liked some butter served with my pancakes (but to be fair I never asked for butter)
Mo'z Cafe,The pancake combo and egg Benedict are both good.
Mo'z Cafe,Generous portions and a comfy casual atmosphere. Everything was really well made and tasted amazing. Definitely the place to go for a quick but good hot meal. Their menu is extensive but I went for the eggs Benedict on hash and was not disappointed.
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent variety of options and my scrambled egg croissant was delicious. The staff was very friendly and the food came out fast. I get that this is San Francisco… but $11 for a PB&J? 😵
Mo'z Cafe,"Delicious amazing food, fulls spectrum of breakfast and hot and cold lunches. Draft beer and mimosas w/ fresh oj made onsite. Great people, clean restaurant and great prices!!!  I had the fruit and nutella crepe, my partner had eggs benedict for breakfast and plan to have lunch there asap"
Mo'z Cafe,"Huge choice of food and lovely staff. Had pancakes,bacon and scrambled eggs with maple syrup! A must.... Very filling and very tasty!"
Mo'z Cafe,Food and service were excellent but felt price was very high. Paid $18 for French toast. I saw crepe on menu for $10 which I guess is fair. However to add berries and banana to it is an additional $8. This is not a fair price.  So for French toast plus coffee I spent around $25.
Mo'z Cafe,The chorizo scramle is quite good with a little bit of Salsa Picante hot sauce added in!
Mo'z Cafe,Really good breakfast spot! Had the basic breakfast and it was really good. They seem to be short staffed though as the person taking our order at the counter was also delivering food and bussing tables but man she did everything really quickly so not much waiting at all! There's  also a VERY limited amount of seating  here. Would absolutely recommend this place!
Mo'z Cafe,"Great food, lively place for the breakfast. They serve coffee as well. Right close to the market street. Ideal place to hangout in the morning if you are planning to visit the Westfield mall on the market street and you can't get in till 10AM."
Mo'z Cafe,Very nice and cozy place to have a yummy breakfast. Great start of the day with their amazing food and service. Recommended 100% 😊 …
Mo'z Cafe,"Average food, really dissapointed and disgusted at the disposable plates, cutlery and cups when eating in the cafe! Sort it out as it’s not necessary when eating in! Just lazy to have everything disposable!"
Mo'z Cafe,The latte and mango smoothie are very delicious. There's a large selection of food on the menu and it feels cozy inside. The employees are really kind and helpful too 😊. …
Mo'z Cafe,"Delicious breakfast, both sweet and savory options. Huevos rancheros were good (although you could argue whether it is technically huevos rancheros) and the crepes even better. Not a 10/10 absolute favorite but we would definitely come back if we’re in the neighborhood."
Mo'z Cafe,"We got breakfast at lunchtime that was perfectly cooked, cut, and seasoned. The smoothies are fresh and amazing. Highly recommend"
Mo'z Cafe,"This place has great food, reasonable prices, and the owner is a really nice man!"
Mo'z Cafe,"This place is extremely mediocre for the price. The cooked food is not worth it; pancakes tasted rubbery and dry and sides were barely seasoned. Things did not seem too fresh. I ate breakfast there twice and vowed to never buy an entree there again.  I live a few blocks away so I come in for their pastries/coffee cake often, usually for a late lunch/snack around 1-2pm. 8 out of 10 times, they will be closed WAY before their listed closing hours; ie. 1.5hrs before listed closing time! It happened to me again today 12/27/22, 1hr10mins (1:50pm) before their ""daily closing time"" of 3pm (they even just updated their hours a few weeks back). Absolutely ridiculous and extremely unreliable; they are located in a busy spot downtown with lots of foot traffic (right across the street from the mall). There were multiple employees just sitting there at a table today watching me stand outside while I was trying to mouth through the window that I only wanted the pastries that were already out on the counter. I even had cash! I will find a recipe online and start making myself some at home to avoid this consistent headache with this restaurant.  Only adding one star for the really friendly younger male cashier, and the delicious NYC style crumb cake (even though it's not house made, which may be a good thing in this scenario)."
Mo'z Cafe,Flew in to San Fran this afternoon and craved breakfast.  Usually I miss out on breakfast because of timing so I was pleasantly surprised to find Mo'z and Eggs Benedict.  They serve breakfast all day and have a variety menu including burgers and crepes (savory and sweet). A little bit of everything.  I ordered a Bloody Mary along with breakfast and it wasn't bad.  My wife had orange juice and and said it was amazing. Fresh squeezed OJ with no pulp. Winner!  It's close to our hotel and the Old San Fran Mint.
Mo'z Cafe,Had the croissant breakfast sandwich with sausage instead of bacon. They have huge portions here. The croissant was flaky and perfect. The scrambles eggs were perfectly done. Still moist and delicious. Short walk to Mascone North South.
Mo'z Cafe,Pretty good spot to get some work done. They serve good coffee and have a pretty massive cafe menu. I'm not sure if they had WiFi but they did have power outlets which was helpful. There's a television that runs all the time but the volume is pretty low and tolerable. Decent place to pause while people watching. Have fun!
Mo'z Cafe,Food was fantastic. Atmosphere was great. We were there around 8 in the morning on a Saturday and it was moderately busy but it didn’t take long to get our food. Fruit tasted crisp and fresh. Will definitely come back next time I’m in town.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great food, great portions, and friendly staff. At least around breakfast, there’s a strong smell of bacon in the air which can get in your clothes - just something to keep in mind."
Mo'z Cafe,The breakfast was so good and to top it off had a couple Mimosas which were delicious as well! Staff was Super Friendly.
Mo'z Cafe,"Mo's pancake combo consists of two well made pancakes, with a side of scrambled eggs and a choice of bacon, ham or sausages. (I chose bacon)  The food was good, and the staff were friendly.  I also order a cappuccino, which was best described as 'ok'.  Nice casual ambience, good for a relaxed meal."
Mo'z Cafe,"If you're looking for a place to eat, you have to try Mo'z cafe. The staff is great.the food was amazing."
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent food and beverage. Breakfast and lunch. Convenient located.
Mo'z Cafe,"Excellent food, absolute excellent service. I’m still craving this food, can’t wait to go back to SF"
Mo'z Cafe,"Visited San Francisco, couldn't find any restaurants that were even close to traditional American breakfast. Stumbled across this place finally and was very satisfied with the customer service and food. The owner took our order and was very informative and helpful when choosing our dish and letting us know what would be most cost effective. Highly recommend this place to eat breakfast and lunch."
Mo'z Cafe,This place was outstanding for a weekday breakfast before JP Morgan.  Fast attentive service and the huevos rancheros with whole black beans and spicy sauce ... yum!  Mango iced tea was a great compliment.
Mo'z Cafe,"Had breakfast early Monday morning (time zones away from home). Huevos rancheros were spot on, coffee dark and thick (delicious). Solid, in City option for a good breakfast."
Mo'z Cafe,Delicious!   The food was fantastic.  Priced fairly: $13 for a crab cake benedict with spinach and less than $5 for a bottle of Guinness. Service was polite and quick.  It is an order-at-the-counter place. Free wifi. Good selection of bfast all day. I'll go back.
Mo'z Cafe,"Love this place, always come here each time I visit San Francisco."
Mo'z Cafe,Great food and the staff is beyond amazing. I had such a great experience.
Mo'z Cafe,cute little breakfast stop :) potatoes were delicious
Mo'z Cafe,Entirely bland and depressing food. The service was prompt but everything else is dreadful. The BLT is $17 before tax. 42Mint around the corner has a burger for $16 and homemade pasta for $23. Go there.
Mo'z Cafe,Absolute must go to for breakfast in  San Francisco. Great straight up good food to fill you up for a day in the city!
Mo'z Cafe,"Super friendly staff, the owner was very polite and patient It kills me that we still have to use disposable cutlery and other utensils... But the meal was good and tasty"
Mo'z Cafe,Very good food in a fast-casual setting. Don't let the lack of table service or fancy tables fool you. This place is excellent. I especially appreciate the enormous cups of coffee.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great food, except the smoothies. For the price, the the service could use some tweaks. Smoothie menu touts fresh fruits and veggies, but the smoothie in the end is an ice-blended concentrate. I’d recommend using glassware instead of plastic."
Mo'z Cafe,"We used Mo'z Café for catering a corporate breakfast event, and everything was wonderful! I can't recommend highly enough. Mo is so great to work with and helped us coordinate everything. It all turned out amazing! We'll be excited to use Mo'z Café again!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great range of choices for breakfast, and coffee better than Starbucks. The only reason for not being 5 star is because no breakfast place can hold a candle to the brunch spots in Sydney and Melbourne"
Mo'z Cafe,Amazing atmosphere and great service. The menu has a great selection with something for everyone. This will become a goto breakfast place whenever we come to the city.
Mo'z Cafe,"Mo'z was a sanctuary for me on a recent trip to SF. Greasy spoon breakfast is peak comfort food for me and they do it perfectly (eggs benedict w/ hash browns was excellent). The staff is friendly and accommodating, the food is simple and delicious, the prices are fair, the coffee is what it is, and I never felt pressured to hurry along. It's a far cry from many of my other SF dining experiences."
Mo'z Cafe,"Cashier didn't give me a table number sign, and the waitress kept walking around with my food until I got up to go tell her it was mine."
Mo'z Cafe,"One of my favourite breakfast spots during GDC. Simple, speedy and good value for money."
Mo'z Cafe,"Great breakfast menu, loved the breakfast burrito. Near Union Square."
Mo'z Cafe,"I was excited to eat here today, the food looked rather tasty. There was a long line, I am pregnant and for medical reasons can not stand for a while. I sat at a table, my husband was in line ordering. The employee came from behind the cash register to yell at me to get up, and they have a system. I honestly was shocked. He made a big scene and it was quite embarrassing. Honestly I would of moved or even tried to explain my situation but he did not even give me a chance. So we left  A little kindness never hurts Try to good from good to great and be kind  Thanks wishing you a better day"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great breakfast place, highly recommend, friendly service."
Mo'z Cafe,"I’ve always come here for breakfast whenever I’m in SFO as it opens early which suits my travel plans plus the diverse breakfast options to choose from, other than your typical American breakfast .."
Mo'z Cafe,"Breakfast at Mo’z is always great. Went for the scrambled salmon with hash. Tasty, hot and quick service.  Very friendly staff and will visit again. Thanks guys."
Mo'z Cafe,First place we went to eat before starting our day around 7am.  Everyone working there was super friendly and it made for a great way to start our morning.  I had the chorizo scramble while my partner had Juevos Rancheros and we both loved it!
Mo'z Cafe,Overpriced and not good breakfast! Atmosphere is also not nice.
Mo'z Cafe,salmon scramble is insanely delicious! not the place if you are in a budget though
Mo'z Cafe,"Service was very friendly and prompt but the food wasn’t very good. I had the “Basic” breakfast- didn’t care for the taste of the sausage, home fries were bland, toast portion was tiny"
Mo'z Cafe,Some interesting food choices but coffee slightly pricy
Mo'z Cafe,Nice service! We were hier for breakfast.
Mo'z Cafe,Friendly staff. Fresh food. My whole party enjoyed their breakfast. Be prepared to order your food at the counter.
Mo'z Cafe,Great service and amazing food. Difficult to beat the cost. The fresh orange juice is to die for and so are the huevos rancheros!
Mo'z Cafe,"Cashier/staff was really friendly and I’d rather not write a bad review but that was probably the most bland food I’ve ever had. I got a BLT and hashbrowns and it tasted like what I used to make for myself as a teenager. Not toasted, hashbrowns were tasteless and mushy. Cheese was just a single cut Kraft slice. This is the kind of stuff you make at home as a late night snack not a cafe.  Staff starts cleaning while you’re eating which was pretty annoying as they’re using cleaning products with strong smells. Disposable plates and utensils also not a good look. Worst part is how much I paid for some really bad food. Fix that and you’ll have a really great experience."
Mo'z Cafe,First time.  Will  return.  Great breakfast and friendly servers.
Mo'z Cafe,People are friendly but concept of cafeteria is the worst. Price are expensive compare to a regular restaurant . No worthy
Mo'z Cafe,"Very good pretty strong coffee, decent food"
Mo'z Cafe,"I had ordered, cream cheese bagel, a cake and Florentine benedict.  First, they're very short-staffed but that's fine. Major issue is food quality and the price they charge for cheap food. My bagel was burnt and it literally was black on the outside not sure how they did not make a new bagel and choose to serve me the burnt one instead. Florentine benedict was so bland and tasteless, whoever made that has a talent for bad cooking."
Mo'z Cafe,Great quick breakfast with friendly service. Great value!
Mo'z Cafe,"Great meals, ready quickly, but the service is outstanding and friendly. We did both carryout and eat in, fully recommend both."
Mo'z Cafe,"Good solid breakfast. Good price. One criticism: the over medium eggs were more over hard. Also, don't know if this is a COVID thing so won't ding the cafe, but bummed about all the disposable dishware."
Mo'z Cafe,"We found Mo'z Cafe online and it was very close to our hotel. The person taking our order was very welcoming and friendly to us and immediately explained how to order. The food was very good and plentiful. I had the Breakfast Croissant with scrambled eggs and ham. Big portion. My wife had salmon scrambled eggs with hash brown and sourdough toast. Very good also. Place looked clean, there was distance between tables and sanitizing station. Recommended for an inexpensive breakfast before hitting the city."
Mo'z Cafe,Best croissant in the US honestly. Friendliest staff- will come back 100%
Mo'z Cafe,"Good breakfast cafe. Standard fare with lots of options. Very good value, the portion size definitely left me satisfied!  Nice environment, do come early to avoid the lines."
Mo'z Cafe,Great little spot with awsome mimosas and bloody marys.  Thank god the food was amazing which took the edge off the screaming kid that everyone was about ready to toss out the door.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great way to start 2021!  I was surprised to find they were open on New Years Day, but I had been dreaming about a good breakfast burrito, so thought I would call. Ordered the burrito for me and the salmon crepe for my partner. DELICIOUS! That burrito was so juicy, tasty, perfect - with jalapenos, black beans, tomatoes, and I don’t know what else, but it was the best breakfast burrito I have ever had! The salmon crepe? The flavor combo sounded too strong for salmon, but my partner finished that crepe so fast, it was scary. I got a bite, and it was also delicious.  Very polite and friendly man wished me a happy new year! I wish him the best 2021. Give Mo’z Cafe a try. Pretty sure you will love them. Reward the good ones in 2021!"
Mo'z Cafe,Super location for breakfast. Friendly service. Delicious food
Mo'z Cafe,Nice cozy cafe in the area with resonable prices. Great pancakes with nice fluffy texture.
Mo'z Cafe,Great food! Nice and cozy atmosphere.
Mo'z Cafe,The service was good but the quality of the drinks were lacking. Mocha tasted more like milk than chocolate. Hot chocolate was too watery.
Mo'z Cafe,Good coffee. Terrible food. I ordered the corned beef hash and didn’t even eat 10% of it. And it was $20.
Mo'z Cafe,"I came here for breakfast, the service was great (super friendly!) and coffee was pretty good. The food was very mediocre, however. Hash browns were soggy and tasteless, over easy egg was not cooked enough, and the bacon was somewhat crispy but still did not taste good. I would not recommend the breakfast food here."
Mo'z Cafe,Fantastic staff! The owner Mo is so friendly! The coffee is immaculate. I had the fresh squeezed oj and eggs Benedict! Everything was cooked perfectly and they have free wifi and light jazz to get your day started off right! The chalkboard menu is also done by a talented local artist! This is a true mom and pop and the vibe is on point 💗
Mo'z Cafe,"Good service, good food, coffee wasn't great but overall is Ok!"
Mo'z Cafe,Great experience. Awesome espresso. The vegetarian sandwich was warm and delicious. Just get the token from counter and seat anywhere. They will find you and serve your order. They checked in once more to ensure I was comfortable. Loved the service and sandwiches.
Mo'z Cafe,"Nice friendly service.  The waffle was delicious but the coffee wasn't. $20 for waffle, coffee and juice"
Mo'z Cafe,"Good breakfast. They are a bit short-staffed, but who isn't these days and we didn't have to wait for our order to be served at the table, we just had to order when we walked right in at the cash, took our order number with us to the table and everything was brought to the table."
Mo'z Cafe,"Chose this place from reviews! Super friendly customer service. Im obsessed with their peach-pear-apricot smoothie, also got the crab cake Benedict it’s perfect 🍳 (great musics too! Super chill"
Mo'z Cafe,"Walked by this place on my way to a different breakfast spot, but it looked good so I stepped in. Glad I did. A great, classic American breakfast spot. Looked good for lunch also. Great sourdough bread. Amazing fresh fruit. I definitely recommend a stop here!"
Mo'z Cafe,Fun find walking around trying to find a place to eat.  It was busy but the staff worked quickly (actually running at times) to get us our food.  They managed to stay upbeat and friendly too.  Food was wonderful.
Mo'z Cafe,The Eggs Benedict had a pungent taste and the chai latte tasted as if it only consisted of cinnamon and water. Ended up tossing both and grabbing lunch elsewhere.
Mo'z Cafe,Great selection of food. Delicious chicken sandwich though I wish there was a little more chicken.
Mo'z Cafe,"Delicious breakfast!!! Best food in town so far, on day 3 of my trip! Definitely recommending this place to eat! I had the breakfast burrito and add the chicken apple-sausage🌯! Taste super delish!!! Thank you guys for cooking great food! …"
Mo'z Cafe,"Decent prices, decent food, and a great selection of choices. I had a salmon scramble for brunch and it was tasty, but not amazing. There definitely could have been more salmon in it. The crepe was a little better but I felt a little like maybe it wasn't quite sweet enough. Despite that, the price point is good enough that it's worth going to even if the food is slightly lacking in some areas."
Mo'z Cafe,"Ate here for breakfast. The first striking thing about this place is what a big (and awesome) menu it has! Lots of great stuff for all tastes. We had the waffle and eggs Benedict. Both dishes were excellent, but the waffle was truly stand out - the waffle itself used a really good and tasty batter. The ordering / service is a bit strange (order first then get your table), but very attentive nine the less! I would definitely recommend this place!"
Mo'z Cafe,Decent basic breakfast. Service was good. I'd go back if in the area.
Mo'z Cafe,Came here for a conference and ate breakfast there every day for three days. Great place.
Mo'z Cafe,"This cafe was great! Flew in from out of town, food was fantastic, owners remember you from the previous day! And the breakfast burrito is really as good as everyone says it is."
Mo'z Cafe,The food was excellent and the service was great. The location is a mixed review but the place is worth the trip.
Mo'z Cafe,"We went to Mo’z for breakfast dozens of times over the five years we lived in SF and LOVE it. The #4 bagel (nova lox), sweet crepes, savory crepes, French toast, and breakfast burrito are some of our favorites! The menu is diverse and has something for everyone, though seating is a little limited indoors and there is no outdoor seating.  Wheelchair accessible entrance is on the alley side, but you must notify an employee from the front entrance to open the side door for you."
Mo'z Cafe,Wonderful find. Great breakfast and lunch selection. Lots of seating. Friendly open atmosphere. Crab Florentine is my favorite breakfast dish there.
Mo'z Cafe,"I only had a black coffee as I was waiting for an appointment and didn't want to feel full before it. The waitress asked the already stressed up me if I was ok and if I wanted anything else. After declining, she offered me water instead. Being Intuitive and proactive goes a long way."
Mo'z Cafe,"The BEST breakfast in town. Massive portions, incredible quality, delicious coffee and the nicest owner! Thank you Mo!"
Mo'z Cafe,Great place for a quick breakfast pastry or sit down meal.  The staff were super friendly and accommodating too!
Mo'z Cafe,"Best corned beef hash I’ve ever had.  Incorporates a bit of mint which seems a little strange, but great.  Took a little long to prepare but was served over perfectly griped hash browns.  Coffee is great too. Gonna have the Eggs Benedict today."
Mo'z Cafe,Prices differ from advertised. Far more expensive.
Mo'z Cafe,Used to be a regular here but the new staff killed it. 3 times now I've been given the wrong Togo order. Today was the last time I'll be treking 2 blocks back to pick up my correct order.
Mo'z Cafe,"I was disappointed. Food comes on plastic plates with disposable cutlery (not great for the environment) and the taste was just OK, definitely nothing special with better diners in the area."
Mo'z Cafe,Absolutely fantastic. They said they were short staffed but it wasn’t a long wait at all despite being pretty busy. Super kind staff and damn good huevos rancheros:)
Mo'z Cafe,"Really cute little cafe with great food and excellent service! Went here for brunch with my sister; i got the pancakes, she got the crab burger. 5/5 overall :)"
Mo'z Cafe,"Had Breakfast both mornings I spent in San Francisco.  Food was great.  Expect the place to be bustling with people on the weekends.  Orders may take a while.  Food could arrive quicker so that it can be eaten at a nice warmer temperature as it was meant to be.  Might be a tad bit on the pricier side, epecially considering the time it takes for the food to get to the table."
Mo'z Cafe,Great spot with inviting atmosphere. It's got a solid menu with good breakfast and lots of baked goods.
Mo'z Cafe,My husband and I visited San Francisco and decided to get take out for Breakfast from this place. It had decent reviews and was close to our hotel. We picked up the food and when we arrived back to our room there was a roach in between the pico in my food. It also had eggs hanging from it. We immediately called and asked for a refund then we followed up with the health department. Horrible.
Mo'z Cafe,"Everything is delicious. The lady who runs the front is very friendly. Last week I had their special, the lox benedict on a croissant with a side salad, and it was amazingly good. Exactly what I needed to improve my day! Though, I probably should have cut it in half before starting, the portions are large."
Mo'z Cafe,This place has the BEST eggs Benedict…. The Hollandaise sauce is ridiculously good! Very nice & helpful staff and great prices! Service was quick as well. Highly recommended!!!
Mo'z Cafe,Great café! Something for everyone!
Mo'z Cafe,"We were tourists staying nearby in the SOMA district. We wanted great coffee and breakfast served in a cozy, warm ambience that wasn't a chain franchise or industrial setting. Mo'z Cafe is the perfect place. We arrived around 11 AM and despite it being packed, we were able to find a table and were served quickly. You order at the counter and they serve you at your table. Lots of choices for breakfast and lunch. The eggs Benedict is delicious. Great vibe, fresh and tasty food with fast service. Highly recommend Mo'z Cafe."
Mo'z Cafe,Moz was a cute little cafe that serviced a delicious breakfast. We got their breakfast burrito and salmon scramble. Everything was fresh and seasoned well.  We also tried their coffees which did not disappoint. A good place to grab a quick bite if you plan on getting on the Powell station BART
Mo'z Cafe,"Good breakfast, the Corned beef hash and breakfast sandwich are best.  Other reviewers, some places just aren't good for some dishes.  I understand the reviews of a bad dish, but don't discount others because they had good dishes.  Fast service, usually not packed like dotties (which I'll never stand in line for, no diner is worth waiting in line), and good food (that I've ordered).  And yes, the pancake's aren't the greatest, but I stick to ordering what I know is good."
Mo'z Cafe,"Really good food here, breakfast and lunch items, I've had them all. The croissant breakfast sandwich is awesome👊. The BLT, steak fajitas, salads with the vinegarrete and soups are excellent. Everything is a bit pricey, but really good and really good quality. The bad: I HATE that they don't have fries, especially since they supposedly have really good cheeseburgers here (I haven't tried one since they don't have fries)."
Mo'z Cafe,"You stand in line to order. I stood long enough to realize no one was paying attention and didn't even realize I was waiting. Finally took my order, they give you a table number and bring it to you. Caramel Macciato was great. My order came first and they got the side dish wrong, then my husband's order came out 10 minutes later. They promised to correct my side order, but forgot. Breakfast burrito was okay, seemed like powdered egg mix. Benedict good. Overall okay, but staff doesn't seem to care and for the price I would rather have at least decent customer service."
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent food and huge portions.  Yummy house coffee and really nice people.  Highly recommend
Mo'z Cafe,"Way overpriced, hash browns were not good, tea was weak (might as well have got water). The pancakes were okay."
Mo'z Cafe,"Delicious breakfast burritos here. They're pretty busy on the weekends, but the line moves fast.  I love how empty it is during the day on Weekdays. They have plenty of outlets for working. WiFi but I've never tried it. & the atmosphere is fantastic when empty. High ceilings & big pretty bars make it feel nice. Highly suggest for remote workers during the work day, just being headphones for music. Many outlets near all the windows."
Mo'z Cafe,Very large widespread beautiful menu the salmon Cobb salad was amazing the piece of salmon was huge and the eggs benedict is really good you can have a mimosa a bloody mary or a screwdriver if that's your cup of tea I just love this place
Mo'z Cafe,Great spot for breakfast! The corned beef and has is on point. Haven't had a bad meal yet.
Mo'z Cafe,Great breakfast without breaking your budget! I visited them every day while in SF. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you when ready. Their orange juice was always freshly squeezed for us. I highly recommend this place.
Mo'z Cafe,I recommend with eyes closed the moz cafe!  first breakfast in the united states for me.  Delicious food and very nice staff ❤ thank you very much for this moment
Mo'z Cafe,"Varied menu and efficient service. I ordered the Salmon Scramble, and I found it to be solid value for $13.99. Both the order process and the colourful menu remind me of Whispers Cafe in San Jose--same owner(s), perhaps."
Mo'z Cafe,"Great place for breakfast.  Quality food at the right price.  Well presented, huge range of available choices.  All freshly cooked.  Plus free wifi whilst you wait.  I like the name as well"
Mo'z Cafe,"Staff was very friendly and they have good coffee.  Other than that, the bacon is paper thin, scrambled eggs were runny, toast was very stale, and they ran out of hashbrowns.  Very disappointed with the food and for the price"
Mo'z Cafe,"I ordered breakfast through Google and was shown that the order was ready for pickup. When I arrived, the store was closed and no one answered the phone."
Mo'z Cafe,I feel even more compelled to write another review. I checked my online banking just now to find out this store fraudulently charged my account again when I have not even returned to their store since my previous bad experience. I’ve notified my bank and will report them to Better Business Bureau first thing in the morning.
Mo'z Cafe,"I really love this place. Unpretentious coffee spot with friendly staff. Great for coffee and fresh OJ. Their breakfast options are awesome and delicious. I also had their salad which I really enjoyed. If you're hungry, tired, or thirsty, need to charge your laptop or need wifi, you can't go wrong here!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Staff is super friendly, but staff has no clue how to cook. Came in there with my wife,kid, and visitor from out of the country, on sunday morning March 4th. Not busy at all, which should have been a sign that the food is bad. I ordered a package breakfast, that included 2 pancakes, some scrambled eggs, and some bacon, for like $13. The pancake weren't cooked all the way, and tastes very funny. The eggs were still runny and also undercooked. The only thing cooked, was the bacon, which was overcooked. The Orange juice i had was satisfying, so I'm giving you a 1 star rating. My companions breakfast was also dissatisfying. I left both pancakes, no us one bite on the pkate, my wife as well, with her plate. She orders her eggs over medium. They were damn near raw, and she also wouldn't eat her pancakes. Terrible, terrible food,  outrageous prices for it."
Mo'z Cafe,Went there for brunch and it was fantastic! Huevos Ranchero was excellent but be warned it’s a little spicy. It was obvious high quality inputs are used based on observations of materials behind counter. Huge menu. Cashier took special order with grace and everything came out right.
Mo'z Cafe,The chai was amazing but it's a bit expensive
Mo'z Cafe,"Fresh squeezed OJ is amazingly good here, it's definitely worth the $5 price tag. I shared a breakfast burrito with a friend and it was really tasty, although slightly too spicy for me normally. I'd love to go back and have lunch there because the sandwiches all looked really good."
Mo'z Cafe,Had pancakes and chicken-apple sausage. Which were overly generous and delicious. My favorite was watermelon/dragonfruit smoothie. Amazing.
Mo'z Cafe,"Amazing place! Went to SFO for the first time and had breakfast here! Loved the food especially the croissant sandwich and burrito bowl, defs go to this place! Mo, the owner, was reallyy sweet!"
Mo'z Cafe,Great staff and great food. Loved talking with the owner.
Mo'z Cafe,It's cute inside and the staff was friendly and helpful.. but my sandwich was nothing special.. I will try it again.. they have a French dip sandwich that looks great!! Just don't get the grill cheese.. boring!!
Mo'z Cafe,This place has the best breakfast!! I ended up going here almost every day I was in SF! The owner was the sweetest guy!! You'll love it!!!
Mo'z Cafe,"This is my favorite breakfast / brunch place in the neighborhood -- and definitely the highest quality:price ratio in the area. The savory crepes, egg specials, pancakes and espresso are amazing. Service was excellent."
Mo'z Cafe,"Service was good, eggs benedict had a broken hollandaise sauce which was a little disappointing and the hash browns were a bit soggy... Overall not a bad experience but could have been better. May give them another chance on another day to see if it was just an off day."
Mo'z Cafe,Great service and food was delicious.
Mo'z Cafe,"Excellent Food, tea, coffee and service. There is a wide variety to choose from. Great atmosphere. A hidden gem"
Mo'z Cafe,"For all of the hype, this place is incredibly slow and disorganized. I am still waiting on my breakfast sandwich, after mentioning it to the server twice, and ordered it 25 minutes ago. At least 3 dozen people have come and gone in that time. Such a bummer. I hope it’s at least tasty."
Mo'z Cafe,"Friendly staff, helpful and the food was great.  We were traveling from Madison, GA and had our kids with us.  We loved the pancakes, Turkey sandwich and fruit.  Good job Y'all!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Food and staff were great!  Place had good business.  We almost passed on it based on the lack of ""curb-appeal"" but I'm glad we went inside anyway."
Mo'z Cafe,"Ordered three breakfast meals, and none of them were tasty. The hash browns seem to have been re-used from the previous day. There are other cafes/diners in the area serving better food for less money. Would not recommend"
Mo'z Cafe,Food was AMAZING. Salmon scramble was phenomenal. Cozy atmosphere and polite staff. 10/10 would recommend. Best breakfast we had our whole trip!
Mo'z Cafe,"Great menu. Good selection of food for everyone. Very accommodating for large groups. My only issue is they don't allow you to reserve tables, but they are always more than willing to pull tables together for you if possible."
Mo'z Cafe,"Fantastic for breakfast. Food, staff... all perfect! Try it!!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Love this place. Great food, great service. Passive aggressive notes are also funny. Would recommend."
Mo'z Cafe,"Best corn beef hash, awesome place honestly!  Ended up eating breakfast there for almost the entire trip!"
Mo'z Cafe,Very friendly staff with tasty food and fast service!
Mo'z Cafe,"Unfriendly staff, very small portions, too expensive, bread is bad and ""potato chips"" means a small bag of old lays chips that you need to grab yourself from dusty table in the back. Really bad experience at this cafe today. The woman behind the desk was really unfriendly, growling at us and acting haughty.  The sandwiches we ordered (tuna sandwich and turkey sandwich) were so so, I could have made them better myself. The bread was not good. Way too expensive for what you get!  My suggestion: go somewhere else!"
Mo'z Cafe,"I had the salmon scramble with orange juice. The salmon scramble was so flavorful I wanted more. There were a lot of distinct flavirs that blended well with the eggs, salmon, potatoes and spices. Getting a seat might be a liitle harder than ordering that rush hour time in the morning though. All in all, a very great experience."
Mo'z Cafe,"Had a breakfast burrito here. They were incredibly fast and friendly. The burrito was great. Be aware that it was surprisingly spicy, but I liked that. Service was impressive with the tables being cleaned as soon as people stood to leave."
Mo'z Cafe,"Breakfast burrito is pretty good.  They add some black bean chili concoction which makes the burrito a bit wet and messy.  The flavor is good, acceptable, but not something to go back for.  It seems that San Francisco has a disdain for breakfast burritos.  Finding what I would consider a really good breakfast burrito has been an issue since my favorite spot for these, a taqueria on Golden Gate closed sometime ago.  My search goes on and on, I am damned to this life of trying any breakfast burrito on any menu in hope that someone gets it right.  The staff was efficient.  If you are walking by and need to eat, you will get fed.  :)"
Mo'z Cafe,This is a very convenient spot right off Market and 5th. I will hands down say Mo'z Cafe have one of the best breakfast burritos in the city. Make sure to get the sauce on the burrito and you will be in heaven. They also do great with carry out and dine in orders.
Mo'z Cafe,Menu has to many options and you have to order before sitting down which makes for a stressful ordeal. Food was good and the service was excellent. However it was all completely ruined with the disgusting condition of the bathroom.
Mo'z Cafe,"Nice selection of breakfast for great prices, but service could have been better and both times we got wrong side orders. The food itself was really tasty and the portions were generous."
Mo'z Cafe,"Fine for a quick bite, but the boozy drinks were bad, and the food was nothing to wrote home about. Wouldn't go again."
Mo'z Cafe,Nice place with atmosphere. Not cheap but it is normal for SF.
Mo'z Cafe,"Nice people, reasonable prices, fast service at 6:45am, great menu options."
Mo'z Cafe,"Good pancake. I and my daughter share the Mo’s Pancake Combo. The bacon, egg and latte are very delicious, especially pancake is fantastic."
Mo'z Cafe,"French toast was fine, but under no circumstances should you order a crepe here. Husband's eggs and sausage were average. Staff was friendly."
Mo'z Cafe,Chill atmosphere. Lots of choice. Full meng of whatever you'd want for breakfast.
Mo'z Cafe,"Fantastic spot for breakfast. Quiet, fast, with excellent food. Got the crab Benedict one day, and the eggs + chorizo the next. Both were great. Excellent coffee as well."
Mo'z Cafe,I love this place! They have everything and the owner is so nice. Great food.
Mo'z Cafe,The food is not great. Everything is served on disposable plates with plastic cutlery. Overpriced.
Mo'z Cafe,cafe food at this spot - super good. Service is excellent even when they are busy. The service was very helpful and observant. They have a lot of positive reviews for a reason.
Mo'z Cafe,"Came in relatively late in the afternoon, but still a couple hours before close. Servers were pretty occupied refilling hot sauce bottles, and not too interested in taking our order.  Food was pretty decent, tables were pretty sticky."
Mo'z Cafe,Did not like the place at all. It has a gringy atmosphere - the place was old and has not received enoigh TLC. The tv was not working correctly. Coffee was very bitter and the Americano was foamy. Our meals were not pleasant either. Scrambled eggs were overcooked and the pancake tasted like pre-made pancake batter. I do not recommend the place.
Mo'z Cafe,"Found this place just walking around. It was very good, friendly service and clean. Plenty of indoor seating. $$"
Mo'z Cafe,"The chorizo scrambled was excellent. Many other choices to pick from, something for everyone! I like that you pay first and receive the food after, and then you can just leave when you're done. Would recommend."
Mo'z Cafe,They're really nice but I really wasn't that hungry so I got the coffee cake oh my God it's so good
Mo'z Cafe,We traveled to San Fran and the cafe was up the street...they were the nicest to our family and gave the best service...the food was fast and excellent.  We are going back today...and maybe everyday this week.  Great to find a am spot right off the bat on our trip!  Would recommend the place to everyone.
Mo'z Cafe,"Decent food, I ordered eggs Benedict and got one normal poached egg and 1 boiled hard egg. Good service. Good coffee"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great place for breakfast and reasonably priced. It was busy with convention traffic, bit the service was great. Coffee was good and the prices much more reasonable than places closer to the convention center and better quality."
Mo'z Cafe,"Very disappointing. Food was mediocre at best and wait staff was extremely cold. Homeless came in and took coffee, then walked outside and sold it to another homeless directly in front of the restaurant. No one felt comfortable saying anything, very unfortunate and sad situation. Definitely would not recommend."
Mo'z Cafe,I love their breakfast ANYTHING!!! they are awesome. Yummy delicious food that I will definitely go back for more. coffee is okay but I do like their croissants a lot.
Mo'z Cafe,Went in for a coffee and for a chat with a few friends. I could not believe that asked if we were going to buy food and when we said we didn't think so they refused to serve us. They were pretty rude too very abrupt. I will not go here again I would advise you avoid the place. For me that is putting money in front of service and it makes me think what other things they put in front of service. Would love a look at the back room. This place is awful avoid it!
Mo'z Cafe,"I usually don’t write reviews but felt compelled to inform customers paying with debit/credit cards. I came here for lunch with colleagues on 3/7/18. Service and food were good until I checked my online statement a couple of days later and learned I was overcharged by $6. I contacted the merchant to resolve the matter  to no avail. The lady helping (Mina) insisted she charged me correctly and dismissed my feedback. I informed her that I have my receipt, and notified my bank who will handle the matter. To make matters worse, my colleague who also paid using her debit card was overcharged by $8. Although the amount isn’t a huge, I can’t do business with anyone who lacks integrity. I will never return."
Mo'z Cafe,"So many excellent breakfast choices. I like all I had tried so far: eggs Florentine, pancakes, lemon crepe, chorizo scramble. Staff is friendly and helpful."
Mo'z Cafe,"I had Crab Cake Benedict with coffee. Probably one of the worst Benedicts I have had before. The egg was hard boiled, and the sauce tasted very stale. The coffee was so so. The staff are friendly thought, hence my 2 stars!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great breakfast!! Not too pricey. The food was really good, lots of options, service friendly, and...right across the street from Nordstroms!!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Nice Place to have a breakfast with friendly staff. The coffee was excellent. The food was not the best i ve ever ate but it was worth the money. Another pro is the cozy athmosphere. So have a breakfast, lunch and a coffee"
Mo'z Cafe,Fresh  and healthy breakfast meals with fruit for a decent prize.
Mo'z Cafe,"Fair prices for good portions and very clean.  The croissant breakfast sandwich was on point.  Only restaurant in the area that opens at a reasonable breakfast time, 6 AM."
Mo'z Cafe,"Delicious fresh offerings! Salad was huge with great ingredients and acai bowl was flavorful, though the acai was partially frozen so I had to eat it slowly."
Mo'z Cafe,"Had the Huevos Rancheros for $11.99. So disappointed... bland jar salsa over scrambled eggs, over soft (not cranchy) corn tortillas. The black beans tasted like they were going bad... No spices to speak of that you'd expect on a Mexican dish! Only ate the eggs! :("
Mo'z Cafe,I only stopped for a bagel and coffee but i wont forget the excellent serviceand kindness from everyone . im looking forward to my next visit!
Mo'z Cafe,Ordered Eggs Benedict with Hash browns. Hash browns were cold and the egg yolk was completely cooked like hard boiled. 😝gross. Coffey was fine. …
Mo'z Cafe,Lox Benedict eggs the best!
Mo'z Cafe,"Got our food to go. I watched as an item was put into our bag then taken out, so I assumed we already had what we ordered and it was a mistake. Wrong. I guess, as we wouldn't be eating in the cafe, she thought we couldn't complain when we found out we didn't get everything we ordered!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Had the breakfast burrito. Too spicy for a breakfast burrito. Served with a side of black bean chili and salsa. Wide variety of items on the menu, which is written in different colors of chalk on black boards spanning two walls."
Mo'z Cafe,Amazing place Great food and super friendly staff (something really missing in the bay area)
Mo'z Cafe,"Great staff, great breakfast food. Ideal place for a relatively quick breakfast meal, close to Union sq"
Mo'z Cafe,"Juevos Rancheros were filling, but lacked flavor. Coffee was ok. The entire restaurant was freezing."
Mo'z Cafe,A nice cafe near the Moscone convention center that is not a Starbucks!
Mo'z Cafe,"The owner is beyond rude.  He made a mistake on our order, made us wait 20 minutes for one of our plates and then had the audacity to ask us to pay for it.  Learn some customer service or make better food.  This place is a waste of your time.  The food is mediocre at best."
Mo'z Cafe,"Big menu, good and fresh food. Homeless guy came in and grabbed my pancaces with his hands and run off. Shocking experience, but I got new pancaces from friendly staff."
Mo'z Cafe,I had the pancake combo and it was good. The coffee is nice and strong and the service was quick. The lunch menu looks good too.
Mo'z Cafe,Great food - awful service.  Servers mixed up our orders multiple times.  Servers can't  keep a clean atmosphere - the place is very dirty (from sticky tables to a sickening sight in the kitchen)
Mo'z Cafe,"Adaquate food, nothing special. Smoothies were icy and not full fruit. Value of food price was higher than others in the area."
Mo'z Cafe,"Great American style breakfast and lunch place. Nice assortment of tea! Fast service, clean, and friendly staff! Recommended!"
Mo'z Cafe,Rancid butter in my Togo order.
Mo'z Cafe,"Quick, carefree cafe with some great breakfast. Friendly staff, well priced and a large all day menu. Nothing fancy, but tasty and relaxed in a central location."
Mo'z Cafe,"This place is mediocre at best. Most of thier good reviews are not relative.  Breakfast was bland and barely warm, Small portions, and served on busted up plate...  I would put this well below an IHOP."
Mo'z Cafe,Great little cafe for to-go breakfast. The croissant breakfast sandwich is really good. They had lots of options. Their coffee is great
Mo'z Cafe,"Only one visit so far and even though the name is great :) corned beef hash was not, it’s the canned kind which I am not a fan of and hash brown was not great either sadly."
Mo'z Cafe,"Every morning place for me. I love everything on the menu. I am new to SF and its nice to find a place that is comfortable, good food, nice staff, and consistent good customer service. I recommend it to friends all the time."
Mo'z Cafe,"The food quality was not good, I came from Seattle we are used to good food. We got Salmon Scramble and Eggs Florentine. With Fruit on the side."
Mo'z Cafe,Very good food plus service. Love the location too. Always try to go there when I'm in the neighborhood. Thanks for a great experience!
Mo'z Cafe,"Very friendly service, so many options. Had the Philly Cheese Steak with Fruit, everything was extremely fresh and good. 10/10 must go."
Mo'z Cafe,"i ordered something online to go i thought i would like for breakfast, unfortunately i did not like it and called back and spoke with Mo (the owner) and he said i could bring the food back and choose anything else i would like on the menu free of charge and what i did end up getting was awesome!! when ever i come back to SF i will be there! thanks MO!"
Mo'z Cafe,Amazing staff! I loved the food. Best place for breakfast really recommend!
Mo'z Cafe,"The doors is quiet for with large portions. A little on the expensive side, but manageable. Lots of selection on the menu... They do a little bit of everything: sandwiches, salads, breakfast, crepes, and desserts."
Mo'z Cafe,"They've removed all the tofu/vegan options from the menu, so don't be fooled by the old pictures"
Mo'z Cafe,"Amazing breakfast, pancakes, eggs, bacon. Traditional for me. I didn't see any repeated orders while enjoying my bite. Short wait, friendly staff."
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent place to have breakfast
Mo'z Cafe,While the food came out quickly and the menu is diverse this isnt the best place. Silverware and coffee cup were dirty and the food wasnt very good. I most likely wouldn't return here.
Mo'z Cafe,Wouldn’t look out of place in trendy SoHo.
Mo'z Cafe,It was good. Not great. Not spectacular. It was just good food and alright service.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great food. Fantastic coffee. Sometimes very busy... be patient. And obey the sign... sit AFTER ordering. Don't be ""That Guy""."
Mo'z Cafe,I came in for breakfast and I dIdnt realize until after I sat down that the my didn't give me the correct change back. I gave him a $20 and my meal came up to $9.17. So I told the guy and he told me what I give him is what I give him and he couldn't give me my change back.  Very very RUDE. He didlnt try to compose or try and fix it plus I gave him a tip. Very very disappointed customer. Will never come back.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great location in downtown and good food, but the best was the service! Five stars to the owner or Manager 👏👏👏👏👏👏 …"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great service with a smile.  Menu is varied but not over complicated.  Coffee is excellent.  American cuisine at affordable prices,  great value."
Mo'z Cafe,"Wow, really delicious food.  I just had an excellent huevos rancheros, delicious fresh beans, great salsa, nice soft corn tortillas.  A real find, and not too crowded."
Mo'z Cafe,The eggs Benedict were really good. Best breakfast we had so far here in San Francisco
Mo'z Cafe,Nice place. Order at the counter and they bring your order to your table. Good breakfast place and good coffee.
Mo'z Cafe,Best good and service ever!!! I wish Fresno had a  place like this!! Their  orange juice was super delicious the cook the best!! Best customer service definitely a 5 STAR!!!
Mo'z Cafe,"Good food. Good staff. First time in San Fran and this place was great. Breakfast burrito might be a little spicy, but definitely worth it."
Mo'z Cafe,Delicious food and excellent service. Liked the classic music in the background too. 👌 …
Mo'z Cafe,Loved the vegetarian burger
Mo'z Cafe,Super bland food that is overpriced. (I got their Mo’z pancake platter and ice tea - do not recommend either)
Mo'z Cafe,So fast and good. Didn’t want a big breakfast and was able to order a side of eggs and avocado! Easy and delicious!
Mo'z Cafe,"Cozy little cafe in the heart of SF. Close to all the major hotels and the convention center. The eggs Benedict was on point here, I'm sure everything else amazing too."
Mo'z Cafe,Nice spot that feels like a quaint neighborhood cafe. Friendly staff. Expansive menu with affordable prices in a part of town that could be anything but.
Mo'z Cafe,"Very good food, friendly staff, coffee is better than most diners I've been to. I had the corned beef hash, great preparation."
Mo'z Cafe,"Great food, fair prices for outrageously expensive SF."
Mo'z Cafe,"I love that they open so early and actually serve a great breakfast and good coffee. The service was very good and the selection, especially for breakfast, is fantastic."
Mo'z Cafe,Went for breakfast.. only scrambled eggs available..on every offering .. said their machine for other types of eggs was broken.?? Very bland eggs and hash browns. . Sorry but it's a no go back
Mo'z Cafe,"Fast, fresh and friendly.  Decent value for the price.  Always seems to be tasty as well!  Lack luster bathroom though.."
Mo'z Cafe,Got the Gyro.  Not terrible.  Cucumber sauce needs help and portion size was smaller than expected.  Charming place though.
Mo'z Cafe,"Pretty good cappuccino, fresh squeezed OJ and good coffee cake"
Mo'z Cafe,Good spot for breakfast in downtown San Francisco: It can be a bit crowded and it first feels a bit like they want to serve as many guests as possible but once you have a table it's all good.
Mo'z Cafe,"Got some pancakes here before closing. Pretty solid pancakes, no complaints. Also ate an egg sandwich here one time. Not a great egg sandwich."
Mo'z Cafe,Good place for breakfast. Food is good quality. Only slight negative is limited seating space during busy hours.
Mo'z Cafe,"I'm here from SFO international airport in the early morning, the day of the soup warm up my first day in SF. Walking takes 3mins from BART station."
Mo'z Cafe,This place has an uncommon feature by which you place your order before you sit down. The breakfast food was delicious.
Mo'z Cafe,Very rude and not nice. priced on the menu don't match the actual price
Mo'z Cafe,Thank you for the wonderful breakfast! I had the pesto Italian scramble. The Americano was also top notch.
Mo'z Cafe,"The staff was friendly but the food was terrible.. Hash brown was soggy, bits & pieces and cold when served.. The only thing I finished was the orange juice."
Mo'z Cafe,"Nice breakfast, good location. Like the french toast. Service is fast. Much better than An iHop or something similar."
Mo'z Cafe,Great for breakfast. Classic American diner style but way better than your average diner.
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent crossaint (with eggs ham and cheese) and amazing eggs benedict!! the hollandaise sauce is beyond what I've ever had!
Mo'z Cafe,Not good. Came here because dotties line was over an hour wait. Big mistake. Go elsewhere the positive reviews are VERY misleading. Rubbery pancakes indeed.
Mo'z Cafe,The food was good but the online price was posted incorrectly and they refused to honor the price we paid online. We went to pick up our food and they refused to give us the food until we paid the price difference.
Mo'z Cafe,"Good food, fast and friendly service, really nice lattes and eggs benedict."
Mo'z Cafe,"Small, comfortable place to start your day with a tasty breakfast. Try their huevos rancheros.  Expect to spend $15-$20 for a meal and coffee"
Mo'z Cafe,"Been coming here for years, food is very good, service can be slower when they are busy. Overall nice spot in the city."
Mo'z Cafe,Came here on a Sunday afternoon maybe around 1 or 2 PM. Experienced GREAT service by the girl in the front. Really appreciate her friendliness.
Mo'z Cafe,"Love, love, love this place.  Mo is the best!  Very welcoming, professional,  and best food for a decent price!"
Mo'z Cafe,I really enjoyed my breakfast here. A delicious bowl of oatmeal and fruit bowl. Coffee was great too
Mo'z Cafe,Order at the counter (from Mo himself) Good menu and everything cooked to order. Awsome smoothie.
Mo'z Cafe,Nice breakfast place
Mo'z Cafe,Really good breakfast.  Very cramped and hard to find a table for multiple people.  Try to get there when it's less busy.
Mo'z Cafe,Mo is the most hospitable person. At home atmosphere with a large menu. Food was made fresh and healthy. Must go whenever in sf
Mo'z Cafe,Pancake combo wasn’t anything special. Crappy syrup and plain scrambled eggs to go with average pancakes. Service was fast and friendly.
Mo'z Cafe,The corned beef hash was good but the poached egg was a little firm for my taste. Clean and friendly staff.
Mo'z Cafe,For breakfast. Had huevos rancheros. Scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up but sauce was good. Solid place.
Mo'z Cafe,"Corned beef hash was pretty damn good, screwdriver was awful. I think they forgot to shake the orange juice—very watery."

Mo'z Cafe,Nice place
Mo'z Cafe,"Prices no longer match those given here. Triple Decker Sandwich now $16.99, the Salmon Sandwich is $18.99. Photo of the menu... In addition, the bad habit of collecting the tip when ordering. The service is underwhelming despite a 20% tip. No serviette, water fetched, milk for the coffee only on request."
Mo'z Cafe,"There were a lot of people even in the morning (seats fill up quickly) I added yogurt and fruit to the granola, and it was delicious. The fruit was fresh, and the yogurt was delicious without being too sour! Coffee tasted good too. And the staff are friendly."
Mo'z Cafe,"Menus such as Mo's special comb and Egg Benedict line up. You can taste American size and taste. It's in a very convenient location just off the main street and there are plenty of seats. A few decades ago, there were some restaurants like Burger King McDonald's, but the number of fast food restaurants has decreased considerably, and the style of eating slowly and steadily has increased."
Mo'z Cafe,"Thank you to the adorable person who welcomed us Saturday noon for an American breakfast before our return to France. Your French is impeccable 😉 Thank you for your kindness, our daughter loved the cake 😊 We wish you many beautiful things 🙏"
Mo'z Cafe,Friendly. Delicious is breakfast. The boss is very nice
Mo'z Cafe,"✅ Nice lady at the cash register, fresh orange juice  ❌ Hearty prices, the hash browns are not seasoned, the French toast was so-so, the cappuccino was okay  Unfortunately we didn't find a good alternative in San Francisco."
Mo'z Cafe,"Is it a butter pancake? I regret asking. 3 sticky pancakes lol It was delicious, but I couldn't eat it by myself... A little over 1500 yen for a coffee plus. I had an expensive breakfast~ The store clerk was kind enough to respond even if I couldn't speak English 😊"
Mo'z Cafe,The food tasted good but it is a bit expensive
Mo'z Cafe,"I ate here for breakfast, the owner was kind and it was good, and the iced tea tasted like water. Average overall."
Mo'z Cafe,"Wide variety of breakfasts noted all over the wall. Excellent attention. Fresh coffee, clean place, quiet. Average prices."
Mo'z Cafe,Nice place to have breakfast but very expensive. Which unfortunately is normal in San Francisco.
Mo'z Cafe,"Great breakfast spot. Not cheap, but tasty and plenty of choice"
Mo'z Cafe,"Very typical place for breakfast, the day I went there was very crowded and being in a hurry impossible to stay but the impression remains positive and I was very disappointed not to be able to stay"
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent place for a nice breakfast. Extensive choice. High prices.
Mo'z Cafe,"Quite ordinary... The bacon tastes like bacon, and the muffins are burnt and bitter after being baked for too long..."
Mo'z Cafe,"Best Cafe in San Francisco! Locals drive to this part of town for breakfast at Mo'z Cafe. From the menu, which has something for everyone (from acai bowls to eggs and bacon to hash browns), everything comes highly recommended! The disposable tableware was probably corona-related, at least everything was served to me on porcelain. Value for money more than top; large portions and fresh ingredients. Great location and extremely friendly staff! My personal highlight of the San Francisco trip :)"
Mo'z Cafe,"I ate Eggs Benedict and coffee, but Eggs Benedict had an uncharacteristic taste~ enough to stop by if you're hungry?"
Mo'z Cafe,"Friendly place, friendly staff, the service is quite fast and the food is good. Perfect for brunch!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Actually a cozy cafe, also the staff was very nice. I had breakfast here and was unfortunately quite disappointed. The hash browns were tasteless and the rest was nothing exciting either. What bothered me the most was that, despite the rather high price, everything was served on plastic plates with plastic cutlery and the tea came in paper cups."
Mo'z Cafe,Excellent place for a good breakfast at a fair price.
Mo'z Cafe,"Delicious breakfast and friendly service. You order at the till and have the food delivered to the table. The selection is large and the food tastes good. You may well risk queuing if you arrive too late. We were there around 9 on a Friday and got in right away. After we sat down, there was a queue for almost 15-20 minutes. For the other guests."
Mo'z Cafe,"During our stay in San Francisco (5 days) we always had breakfast in this place, every day a different menu, we were never disappointed. Clean room and friendly staff."
Mo'z Cafe,"Great food selection! Delicious coffee. Unfortunately, these are now completely disposable crockery and disposable cups. Even if you eat on site. Very friendly boss at the checkout. Whether breakfast or sandwich. It has always been delicious and reasonably priced! I just hope that at some point people will think about the environment again and that you can eat from a plate and drink from a porcelain cup. Plus, it tastes better then."
Mo'z Cafe,"The food wasn't very good. The prices are very high, we paid $41 for pancakes & eggs with bacon + 2 drinks. The location is okay and there is enough seating. However, I would not recommend it because of the quality/price ratio!"
Mo'z Cafe,"Great welcome for the first breakfast in San Francisco, everything is good, go there with your eyes closed. Really. We'll be back tomorrow"
Mo'z Cafe,The menu board is nice and appetizing! It feels more like an old school American cafe than the nearby Blue Bottle Cafe or Starbucks. Both dishes and desserts are delicious. Coffee is not good enough... Recommended for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing.
