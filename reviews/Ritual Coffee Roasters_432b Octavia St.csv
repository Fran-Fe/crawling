Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Tiny, shed-size coffee shop at Patricia’s Green. Plenty of outdoor seating. The Brazilian single-origin they had on drip was acidic and a somewhat earthy with a dry aftertaste. Raspberry was the prominent flavor. It was served piping hot so be careful! The baristas were super friendly too. I wasn’t blown away by the coffee, but this shop is worth a shot if that’s the flavor profile you like."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Ritual coffee is probably good everywhere. And I have a special appreciation for the people working at this location. Always so kind and helpful on top of making delicious coffee drinks. Everyone here is super friendly and I’ll give a special shout out to #Justin&Tyler :)
Ritual Coffee Roasters,My favorite coffee is served right here. Love Ritual coffee
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"My favorite coffee in Bay Area, the cappuccino as good 12 years ago!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,They make some of my favorite cappuccinos in SF! I live right by one of their locations and their cappuccinos always leave a sweet finish/after taste. I love that they use Minor Figures Oatmilk! It’s light and let’s the flavor of the espresso shine.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Try and avoid the weekends and have no wait time to enjoy a San Francisco classic. Great coffee in a great little spot. They truly know what is a long black which is a nice surprise. They normally have tasters of the chocolate which pretty much entices you to buy a bar. You can walk across the way and enjoy the coffee on a nice patch of grass.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Lovely spot and amazing staff, consistent coffee. Really enjoyed my iced American, totally hit the spot and a nice place to walk around this location. So many shops to check out."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Guess I’m a critic because my shot was over extracted?  I was giving this place a second try because it was underwhelming the first go around, but I’d been recommended Ritual several times.  I asked the cashier what they had for espresso. He told me they had a blend and a single origin but they hadn’t dialed it in. Not sure what they were waiting for. It was 11:30 and they weren’t that busy. Why even tell me about it? I went with the blend because the cashier insisted it was pulling great. I could tell the coffee itself was pretty good but it wasn’t a good shot.  I finished it and went back in with the dishes. They asked how it was and I shrugged. After I left I could hear them mockingly say, “I guess we have a critic!” If you don’t want feedback maybe don’t ask the question.  The only redeeming quality is that the roasters seem to know what they are doing. I wish the staff understood that they are the end of a long journey that required considerable effort from a lot of people."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Hi Andrew! We are so sorry you had a bad experience with us! We were training a new barista this morning, and we really appreciate your feedback. We've gone ahead and given you a refund and hope that you give us another shot in the future. Have a nice day! "
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Even better service. The group of barista made a simple coffee order a really enjoyable time. Casual shi-fu-mi while waiting for my order was clutch
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"My favorite of all the Rituals in the city. I've been so many times, and have never gotten a bad latte. Great area to wander around if you're visiting, lots of spots to sit and enjoy."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Probably first time ordering from ritual. After debating for a long time what to get, the host recommended me this floral drink. I also bought a bag of coffee beans to take home. Forgot what this drink was called. But love the latte art that was done on the drink, will be back again to try out other coffees."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"This is such a wonderful coffee roaster. They're working on growing, it seems. I hope they keep their awesomeness."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I like their coffee more than blue bottle.   They have several choices that are brewed per order. Only down side if the line is long there a wait because they're not the quickest here.   This is a small shop so enter at the left door and then wait for your name to be called.   There's some outdoor seating if weather permits.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"A delight! Service is friendly and efficient, and the coffee is excellent. Here’s a photo taken of the business at 8AM on a busy weekday. Other neighborhood coffee shops (eg Wise & Sons) are terrible, but Ritual keeps it professional and efficient. Five stars."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Really friendly staff. They take Google Pay, so I could just pay with my phone. Got a decaf latte and a green tea with foamed almond milk. Both very good. Just wish that they had artificial sweeteners... But alas they do not. Also wish they had some tables set up outside with some umbrellas, it gets sunny, and all the other spots to sit nearby often get taken or they're out in the middle of the sun"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Always amazing coffee. Service is slow but they are always busy so not surprising.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I used to love this place. Now I just like it. Partly it's the vibe (the baristas are nice but it's a little too snooty trendy hipster) and partly it's how they serve the coffee. A pour-over used to come in an elegant carafe and mug. But no more. Still the location is great and it's pleasant to sit outside and people watch with your very expensive cup of joe.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Nice small coffee shop next to a nice small park. Grabbed a latte every morning here during our trip and it was a great start to the day
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"There's a saying in English that goes something like this: ""omit needless words."" The voice of my English teacher from many years ago echoes in my mind, but I think he (and Strunk & White) was right.  Sometimes it takes just a few words and nothing more to get your point across.  Ritual's brief but helpful description of its Farami Red Honey (Costa Rica Single Origin) accurately described the notes that I tasted in my cup. I was impressed by how well (if that's how you might want to describe it) they produced a fruity and clean cup using a v60 hario (which I also ended up purchasing from them to replace my handmade ceramic one).  Two birds with one stone.  Service was solid.  I guess a downside is that they don't have indoor seating or any formal outdoor seating. However, note that it's more of a communal outdoor seating situation (the businesses share picnic tables/random chairs in the outside area).  See all photos from Christine H. for Ritual Coffee Roasters  Eric S. San Francisco, CA 54447 11/17/2022 2 photos I used to come here every day before making my own coffee. But I still occasionally come to Ritual. The location is great to find a seat at the park, people watch and enjoy your coffee.  Money saving tip!: If you want drip coffee but don't want to always have to pay a premium price - order a ""just a coffee to go"" and it's just $3.75 or something around there. The small to go size is just a little under $3. This is the same coffee but just not made to order. It's the coffee that was made in the morning in the insulated samovar and it's delicious. Another tip is if you frequent the place, get a stamp card where you can earn a free drink. You have to ask for one tho, they don't just hand them out without you asking.  Also, their seasonal special lattes and iced drinks are always delicious. You can't go wrong with that menu, if they have them.  The staff is always super nice and I appreciate how most of the staff are unapologetically non-binary/queer.  You'll always get a really quality cup of coffee or latte made perfectly. If you want a caffeine kick, Ritual has the goods. And believe it or not, Ritual is a bit more affordable than Blue Bottle down the block.  One of their special holiday lattes from last year.  Johnny A. Stockton, CA 154541 6/26/2022 I was excited to finally give them a try as I have been to many coffee shops in SF. This was the absolute worst ""coffee"" I've ever had, not only in SF. We had 4 drinks and all of them were atrocious. I have had water with more character and body than whatever they put in their cups.  This isn't craft coffee, it's a watered down, overpriced, insipid cup of nothing.  Do they drink what they serve? Do they even know what they're charging people for???? I'm not sure what was worse, the vapid liquid in my cup or the snooty, cocky and plainly unpleasant staff. Given the choice, I would rather drink 7/11 coffee. Go somewhere else for coffee while in SF, literally anywhere else.  Andrea H.Elite 2022 San Francisco, CA 5104538 8/24/2022 1 photo My absolute favorite coffee in the area! You can use their square site to make a mobile order in advance. My go to is their almond milk latte. Super friendly staff.  Almond latte"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Love this location! Quick service, friendly baristas. Coffee is great. Just wish there was a size >12oz for caffeine addicts like me. The Octavia Street location is perfect for grabbing coffee in the morning. Visiting from New York and made this stop twice during my visit. Hope to be back soon!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"excellent coffee, great outdoor seating on the square"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Delicious pour over coffees and enjoy that they have informational cards on their growers and coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Centrally located if you're not in a car. Latte was very creamy and fragrant. No parking and expect a worthwhile wait especially on the weekends. Plenty of seating at parklet next door.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The location of this cafe is conveniently located off of major highway entrances/exits. I love that it has a small park area to relax next to. Unfortunately the oat milk cappuccino I ordered was super watered down :( no sweet flavors even from the oat milk. I have tried the other location on haight which hasn’t missed compared to this octavia location. Better luck next time.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Hard to not love this location. Right next to Patricia’s Green & the square with plenty of seats and vibrant vibe. Not to mention their coffee is one of the best in town. I live across the street and this is the go-to spot for start my morning.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The coffee is exquisite here. I got pour over yk; best choice - worth it! Pleasant area.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Such a perfect stop for coffee if you’re out and about walking, sitting in the park or shopping! Cute shop and great seasonal sips!!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Delicious coffee, great service. One of the best lattes I've had in the City. Ritual is right across a lovely park, and it's nestled in a nice neighborhood with lots of boutiques and shops (though there is a homeless encampment a block away, FYI if that bothers you).  Just be mindful that there is no restroom during COVID-19, like many other places right now, so plan for that!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, super friendly and knowledgeable baristas. Love Ritual!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The baristas aren’t the nicest. Coffee is good though.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Suuuuuper nice little spot & the staff is so friendly!!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"We’re local and this is our go-to for coffee. The staff are delightful and happy to adjust orders according to our needs. Patricia’s Green, a small park with plenty of benches, is right next door and it’s a great spot to sit down and enjoy our freshly brewed coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I’m just happy that they make an awesome cappuccino because I felt very mistreated there. The staff on duty today treated me like I was a bother, didn’t say a friendly word to me, just took my money. ...asked me to wait outside even though I had my mask on and there was no one else there and I was sitting on the bench they have provided. When I asked if my chocolate croissant could be heated they just said “no we don’t do that” when my order was ready, no thank you come again, nothing... no words. I would definitely rather go to a place with friendly service and an decent cappuccino...sorry but that’s how I feel:("
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I've been to this particular Ritual Coffee location a few times, but never any other spots. I love this area in Hayes Valley and I love this location. It's in the middle where all the little restaurants and shops are at, where people walk past with their dogs, and where people are just simply relaxing and enjoying the day. The coffee itself is delicious and service is quick. While I love my Starbucks and Philz Coffee, there's always a wait, but I've never had a long wait here ever! The great coffee, awesome location and superb service make this such an ideal spot to just hang out during the day or to take a break from work. Plus, Smitten Ice Cream is right next door! Coffee and ice cream break, anyone?? Will be back!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I live in the South Bay, but when I'm the Hayes Valley area, I always treat myself with a cup of coffee at Ritual. I have enjoyed many different bean varieties and have not been disappointed once. The baristas are all friendly and knowledgeable about the products. I am impressed about all the regulars that come by that the staff are genuinely happy to see. It's a great business that promotes a neighborhood community  The location has outdoor seating around the park near by and right outside their stand. Enjoying a cup of Ritual Coffee and a book on a nice San Francisco afternoon is hard to beat."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Very tasty cappuccino and nice view from the window! Cozy place to stay!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Amazing little shipping container cafe. Can't go wrong with Ritual but have always found this locations staff to be absolutely wonderful. Great coffee, selection of beans, in an awesome location in SF. Perfect place to spend an afternoon lounging in the sun."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,A nice place for Togo coffee at the heart of Hayes valley. A good location to enjoy the sun.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The best coffee in town ! I love their cappucino and the trick is to take your breakfast on the Terrace
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Best coffee on our trip to SF. We got a Davy scone as well that was delicious.  The outdoor gym/fitness center nextdoor gives you a show while you wait in line too!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ritual is in a great area and has a really fun aesthetic, but the coffee was very expensive.  Updated July 2021: They take COVID protocols pretty seriously still, which I appreciate. Only one customer is allowed in the store at a time (it's a tiny converted shipping container) and masks and distancing are enforced. I enjoy them taking these safety precautions. The drinks are still business as usual!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Coffee was great, but the location does not have any seating.  I have been to this location several times and there is a park right beside it.  If the weather is good and it’s not crowded you can enjoy you coffee.  Roast was on point and had a great flat white."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,My favorite SF coffee roasters. Note: this Ritual spot is a tiny coffee hut and all the seating is outside.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"My favorite coffee shop in SF, located in heart of Hays valley, bunch of cool stores in walking distance. I especially like their dark roast coffee. You can't go wrong with the Latte."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and friendly service in a cool space.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Overall tasty coffee but way over priced for the quantity you receive. Yeah the location is great but when paying $4.50 for a one sized ice coffee less than 8 oz plus tip I would expect a larger pour. Fix that and I’ll give Ritual 5 stars.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ritual is one of the best cups of coffee in SF. This pop-up location is in one of the best sitting/people-watching parks in the city on a sunny day. Excellent coffee + exceptional sitting = fantastic outdoor coffee experience. Don't come here on a cold day--in case it's not obvious by the description, there is no indoor seating... It's a pop-up."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great little coffee shop near a park and some seating. Also sells nice single origin coffee beans. Lots of tea options if you want something different. Great coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,It is one of my favorite Ritual locations. It has excellent coffee and perfect outdoor seating topped with friendly baristas.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"On average, the best shots of espresso in San Francisco.  I recommend this shop in particular.  Ritual does a nice job with single origin beans as well.  I've always been happy with the pour over and aeropress I've made at home from Ritual's beans."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ritual is pretty great, I love this kiosk location cause it's very accessible and everyone's very friendly. They make it easy and convenient to place an order, whether it's ordering at the counter or through the RDY app."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Amazing coffee and great staff. The place is in a shipping container, which is interesting, and the area is perfect for walking around while drinking coffee. The staff is extremely friendly and very talented. I bought a bag of coffee, and I made great coffee with it!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"SF has a lot of coffee competition but Ritual remains my go-to. The coffee is bright, fruity and full of flavor. The staff here are friendly but the spot is not a sit down unless it's a nice day and you can sit in the open public space right outside."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The espresso drinks from Ritual are the cornerstone to build one of the most perfect days on the planet.  Have a 5-star cappuccino and do some people watching on the green, then walk over to the boulangerie for a take away lunch.  Head up to Muir Woods and do the Dipsea loop.  Clean up and slip down to Sonoma for a wine tasting before dinner."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Coffee is a bit small, but that's because I'm an addict and want a medium sized coffee always. It's really good quality for what it's worth. Also they do latte art which is such a treat."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I had my first taste of Ritual Coffee the other day, and I have to say I liked it!  I had the Kenyan roast drip coffee.  The flavor was very complex, as you would expect from a Kenyan roast with hints of orange in it.  It was a nice sunday so the line was a bit long, but well worth it."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"What a wonderful little spot to grab coffee in Hayes Valley! Located inside a freight box, this little coffee stop is a great place to get a pour over coffee or an espresso drink while enjoying all that Hayes Valley offers. There may be no roof over your head, but you can sit outside in one of the many seats outside this little outdoor coffee spot. They even have a small selection of pastries for you if you're feeling peckish. Also, the baristas are wonderful people, too."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The team at Ritual Coffee on Octavia St. was awesome! Yes the coffee here is delicious but the staff made my wife and I feel super special and it’s why we came back three days in a row while visiting from out of town. Super friendly staff and the service was fantastic! We will be back the next time we are in town. Thank you  Jermey, Katelyn and Olivia for making our day!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"For being a super ""hipster"" coffee spot, they are SO friendly and welcoming. I love Ritual's variety of coffee beans...they make a mean Americano and a delicious latte. Love their unique brand, too."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Excellent grab and go coffee in the heart of Hayes Valley
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Wow, great coffee! I had the Kenya pour-over and my friend had mocha. My only complaint was it wasn't quite hot enough for me. Otherwise, you'd have had 5. Thanks for great service too!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Good, mildly-roasted coffee. A downside is that prep always takes 2x as long as it feels it should when compared to Blue Bottle, Artis and other places. On earlier visits I also made the mistake a couple of times of asking if they had darker roasts from which to choose.  Ritual doesn't roast that way, I was scolded. I know some on here cited friendly baristas. I've found service a definite weak spot when it comes to a sense of speed and openness to well-meaning questions."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Doors open at 6:30-6:45 FOR FRIENDS OF EMPLOYEES and 7a for the rest of us.  The coffee is good.   I'm glad their chocolate for mochas contains milk after all it's milk chocolate not nut extract liquid or water added chocolate syrup.  Vegans can order many other product or bring their own chocle syrup...
Ritual Coffee Roasters,coffee seems amazing and sometimes they have good icecreams !
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Really high quality coffee. Worth it. Very hipster vibe which is annoying but that’s the price you have to pay for a good coffee
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Coffee is no good here. I ordered a red eye which is espresso in a cup of coffee. They gave me about 2 ounces of coffee with an espresso in it. And it was not good. I try random coffee places all over the country because i travel for a living. You can get better coffee at a gas station.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Like the other Ritual locations, great coffee and nice staff! What else do you need. Note: only outdoor seating at this location. The coffee is pricey but it's San Francisco.."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Hipster coffee place that's serious about the stuff they serve up. The coffee is always perfectly made with a great depth to them.  I didn't find any outlets here the time I came hoping to get some work done, despite a large number of tables and people working."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Pros: - best coffee I've ever had - ""Los Gigantes"" whole bean - ""El Angel"" whole bean (maybe my favorite) - iced latte was so smooth, rich, and flavorful - one of the few coffees I can (and prefer to) drink black - roasted in SF! - perfect for home espresso machines - coffee packages state when the bean was roasted to ensure freshness  Cons: - why do you have to cost so much whyyyyyyyy (so worth it) - baristas are a bit coffee snobby  Bottom line: Ritual is frequently rated as the best coffee in the Bay Area for a reason. I have yet to find a coffee that I like more than these and I love going to work in the morning because it means I can have Ritual when I get there. If you enjoy coffee, this is a must."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Coffee is excellent, but I don't get the point of ordering online and them not making the coffee until you check in at the register. It slows everything down and just increases contact with other people."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Hi Colleen! I'm sorry about your experience with our online ordering system – we heard your feedback and we're using a new order ahead system, RDY. It won't make your drink until you're nearby, so you won't be waiting for your drink, or get cold coffee. The link is https://linktr.ee/RDYapp Plus, if you try it out this month, you'll get a free drink in your account every week through November. Thanks again for the feedback!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"This is strictly for the non dairy mocha.  Two things: their mocha mix has dairy in it, so fine for some people who can do small amounts of dairy but not for allergic and vegan ppl.  They have two choices of milk, soy and almond.  The drink itself is meh. Thin. Not much flavor or body. Better than hot Sweet water that I've gotten at other places, but not by much, and it isnt super cheap. Would def try a new place over here"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee in the city! Awesome baristas, super friendly and always up to chat. They've literally got making a single cup of coffee down to a science. Better than Bluebottle, Philz, Fourbarrel and all the other pourover spots in the city. I used to be a diehard Bluebottle fan and I converted to Ritual when I moved close to Hayes Valley. Definitely check them out and see the difference for yourself."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,My favorite coffee shop in the city. The staff are friendly and the coffee is consistently good. There are always awesome dogs chilling out the front and nothing beats sitting in the park on a sunny day.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Love this location, the coffee is great, during my last visit the staff wasn't accommodating"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I wouldn't say I'm a coffee snob, but I do in fact I really dislike Starbucks, even though I'm pretty sure I drink it every day since I'm provided with a hot cup of coffee in the morning and I have yet to figure out the source. It's curious.  Anyway, it may seem strange, but I often judge the coffee I drink by how long it lasts (pure black coffee, without milk or added creams) either out or in the fridge.  For example, Starbucks coffee sucks, hot and cold. Peet's coffee sucks cold. Stumptown coffee is good hot, cold, and room temperature.  And to my surprise, I had Ritual coffee, hot and cold, and thoroughly enjoyed them both. This place brews a really mean cup of black coffee, and I wouldn't recommend it any other way."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"For Australians visiting from Sydney or Melbourne, this is actual coffee. Super good coffee, not over roasted, not burned, good blend, served in appropriately sized cups... Highly recommended."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Excellent hand-crafted coffee drinks -- the location of the shop is awesome -- right on the edge of Patricia's green, where a few food trucks are parked, and stores are erected from shipping containers. A block away from Biergarten, and bars / restaurants / shops in lovely Hayes Valley"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee served open air style!  I enjoy their coffee joint in the mission so I was thrilled to find them here as well.  Staff is friendly and know how to make a great coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"5 stars for the coffee. Consistent, delicious, high quality coffee. Slightly less stars for pastries. Ask if the pastries are fresh to avoid getting a pastry that may be a few days old."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee, beans, baristas and location in SF!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,This place is three words: A-maz-ing! Wow! I got the iced coffee and it was knock your socks off good! No sweetener needed! It was honestly so delicious black! They do their own roasting and they are doing it well! This is a definite stop for any coffee fan!  I can't wait to go back for a cappuccino!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Always excellent medium to light roast pourover. After all these years, Ritual still serves some of my favorite San Francisco coffee, even if it does take forever sometimes. :)"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Im not sold on this place.  It's a small little house that serves pricey coffee and tea.  I had tea and it was luke warm, so it pretty much tasted like dirty warm water with a hint of tea leaves. The only place to sit down is outside on the dirt lawn. It had just rained that day so it was all muddy.  So I doubt i will ever go back."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great lattes & hot cocoa. Great for dog lovers too. They have doggy treats so your canine companion can give a thumbs ... er...paw up!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,High quality macchiato ☕️
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"You probably already know the shop is in a shipping container, so it's pretty tiny. Is it a good place to stop and grab a cup to go as you stroll? Yeah. It's damn good coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Not even exaggerating, this was the worst brewed coffee I have ever had...ever! Such a weak flavor, like drinking dirty water. I'm hoping I just had a bad batch because otherwise all these reviews are by brainwashed SFers. Blue bottle was terrible as well, but slightly better."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Yearning for a cozy atmosphere to sip a quality coffee while chatting with friends or taking it to go? If so it might be time to be keen on Ritual Coffee Roasters.The RCR sends out quality tasters to coffee plantations in Central and South America to make sure to have the best beans on the scene. Not only does the coffee taste great, but will surely take you down the path to buzz-worthy goodness.  Experience your java love here at their cute SF proxy location. The baristas are highly educated and coffee connoisseurs can discuss terroir and nose; the rest of us can sink back and savor the buzz."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Walk up coffee shop in a shipping container on temporary use permits. Public outdoor seating available. Ritual is known for their exquisitely prepared espresso, and with good reason."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"In a competitive coffee town, Ritual has broken through to the top tier of caffeinated contenders. This location, in a shipping container just off Patricia's Green (and suspiciously close to San Francisco's current craft coffee heavyweight) is conveniently located in the neighborhood, and is worth the price tag of a cup if quality is what you're after. Their coffee is hand-sourced, roasted, and brewed, so the character of each cup comes through. Try a cup for your next Hayes Valley outing and see for yourself."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Love coming here for a coffee and sitting in the sunshine right outside. Make sure to get a loyalty card!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Cute little coffee shop with great outdoor seating. Tasted their cappuccino and espresso which was really good 👍 good spot to just hang out and soak up the vibe of the area. …
Ritual Coffee Roasters,My go to place for v60 coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I had a superb latte from this Ritual Coffee Roasters outpost. The shop is set inside a shipping container, so virtually all of the sitting side is outfits."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"One of the best coffee since I come to SF, the coffee is quite nutty which I like it."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Super quick, good location."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"DRINK: 1.) Coffee - more on the acidic side  SERVICE: workers are nice  ATMOSPHERE: Cute outdoor in Hayes proctor projects. On the side of the cute small grassy park to sit around, ppl watch, meander to the Hayes Valley shops, stores, restaurants, etc."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee in a convenient location, if you happen to be walking down Patricia's Green."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Super place to meet and chat with coworkers. The service here is attentive. Prices were reasonable. Similar to a cafe in Las Vegas I loved.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Amazing cappuccino. Nice options to sit outside in this small park.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,The cappuccino was pretty standard 3rd way coffee. The ice-latte did not have a strong enough coffee taste for my liking.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Yum! Really good coffee. I wish they had bigger sizes for lattes because I can finish it in a few sips, it is that good!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Best Latte ever!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Cute baristas Tio and Kayla served me a Guatemalan house coffee. Yum! The experience in Hayes valley at ritual coffee is very cool vibe.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Place is cool, coffee good but small cups for a 4.5$ cappuccino + bring some time, they are not the fastest here."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Really cute coffee shop and their latte was amazing!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Can’t go wrong with some delish cold brew served out of a shipping container. No seats but no worries, have a seat in the park next door"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,$4 for a tiny 8 ounce iced tea. Same size at Starbucks is $2.25 and tastes the exact same.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Chilled out outpost of Ritual coffee roasters, brewing espresso drinks on a La Marzocco GB/5 and also doing batch brew, pour-overs and tea."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Friendly staff. Unique location. Fyi No bathroom nearby. $3.75 for 12 Oz coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,I like latte and here's environment. If u hv time and u should come here and relax it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,This place probably benefits from more from great coffee and a beautiful location. The service on the other hand is just ok: friendly but chaotic.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Joining the ranks of shipping container businesses Ritual is a welcomed addition. Good coffee with a friendly staff.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Neighborhood friendly hipster coffee spot. And hotspot, don't forget your iPad. Also the coffee is fresh, well prepared, just excellent."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Small but really cool space. People were lining up with their dogs which made it even more fun. Great shots too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"This place is a stand in Hayes Valley, in a courtyard that sometimes has food trucks. The coffee is amazing though and worth the short wait while they brew it individually."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"My favorite hipster coffee in SF. Super attention to quality yields rich and complex espresso, every time."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and very helpful and pleasant staff.  I had the daily drip and sat outside relaxing.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Ordered a latte but it felt like there was barely any coffee in it. Love the concept of the cafe though!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Cool pop up feel right on the plaza so you can sit and enjoy you drink afterward.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Nice little coffee shop with lots of flavor! If you like  pour overs it’s a must stop!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Never been in a cafe where I have to pour my own oat milk in a latte. . .
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great place to grab a quality coffee and pastry and sit in the little park across the street for a perfect morning.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Amazing ☕. Nice place outside to enjoy. Delicious pastry too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and happy to take my order for a Long Black which is normally met with blank stares in the US.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Rich quality coffee. Long wait 20+ mins on weekends due to nice location.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Great spot with friendly staff. This location is dog-friendly, which makes it a fantastic part of your morning routine!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ritual is always good, and this location is so nice. Great location, and welcoming employees."

Ritual Coffee Roasters,"One of my favorite coffee shops from 6 years ago. Located in the heart of Haysbury. There are no seats inside, but Hayesbury has plenty of benches so you can sit outside.  This area is a haven for San Francisco's hottest crowds.  There are other blue bottle coffees in this area as well.  Personally, I always order an iced latte (around $5) here."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"If you drink it, you will understand why everyone calls it life latte. A cup of savory latte in the morning makes the world happy."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I had an iced latte, and it was the most delicious latte I've ever had in my life. I will definitely go again."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"I came here to buy it specially, but the service attitude is very poor, which is disappointing. There is no one in the store but still can only wait outside, ordered 8oz of Hot chocolate but charged 12oz... really a very bad experience"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Good coffee to take away because drinking it there is very cold. They have variety from Central and South America.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Latte and drip are good, but you can have cold brew coffee. The taste is sour. They also sold shirts. You can enjoy a cup of coffee while enjoying the scenery on the chairs outside."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Coffee on the go, very good, Gourmet, the attention is very good, they sell coffee machines, what you can eat is a sweet filled donut or some very large and delicious cookies, soy milk like almonds, coffees from all over the world! They have a place to sit but few, the small cafe is very small! Ask for the large if it is to take away"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"It's good to buy coffee and drink it while basking in the sun in the park! It was delicious coffee with acidity, and the store was small, but it had a light atmosphere."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"Ritual's takeout stand. Although the store is not big, you can enjoy cafe latte that competes for 1st and 2nd place in San Francisco. The staff are very cheerful and eager to answer your questions about coffee"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,Cold brew with acidity. It's good to have a Tekka and eat in the park right in front of you. Oh good~
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"The coffee taste is excellent and the baristas' sincere service 👏🏼 Nearby boutique shops, beauty shops, restaurants, and ice cream shops How about spending a healing time and finishing with coffee here?☕️"
