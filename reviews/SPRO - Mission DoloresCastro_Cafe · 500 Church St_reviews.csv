SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Lovely little coffee shop super close to Dolores Park. Really like their modern interior and large drink menu! Tried strawberry fields and it was super refreshing and flavorful. Salmon sandwich was to the point as well! Mild salty salmon, cream cheese, capers and lettuce - ideal proportions and great taste. Like outdoor seating when it’s sunny. The service is fast. They bring your order to your table even if you seat outside. Highly recommended!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Had the Tea Thyme and New Orleans seasonal coffees - both were delicious! Service was great and the person working at the register was awesome! Love all the creative coffee flavors they have!
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Delicious, hearty breakfast with high quality ingredients and so many fun drinks—stuck with the classics this time around but wish I could try them all!  First time visiting the brick and mortar after years of going to the food truck at Spark Social in Soma back when I worked nearby. Stumbled upon while searching for breakfast spots on Google maps and was delighted to find this a 1 min walk from Dolores Park nearby to our Airbnb.  Staff were friendly and thoughtful, giving me a heads up that while the Italian sausage was fully cooked, it might still look a bit pink inside due to being cooked 24 hours sous vide. They assured me it was really good, and they were right! Had to take the second sausage to go and it was great breakfast the next day."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Good coffee, nice flavor combinations, not too sweet, pricy. I wouldn’t do a $6-$7 small latte regularly, but it’s a nice treat. The rose cardamom latte was tasty, not overpowering, and is made with a house-made syrup. The cardamom was a little gritty but it was fine. It’s a bright, clean space, I didn’t find it unpleasantly sterile. There’s counter seating, but it’s not a super comfortable space where I’d want to sit and work at length."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"I got the umami bomb, super tasty and looks good too. Very flavorful, generous avocado, tasty microgreens. The bread was also good, which makes or breaks a toast."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"really great coffee at spro - it definitely seems like they have good practices and dial in their coffee very well. vibes are great too!!  tried an espresso shot, pour over, and one of their seasonal drinks (pixie dust)  the espresso and pour over were both exactly what you want, they were well extracted and clean  the pixie dust was really wild, it was like a latte but with strong citrus and spice flavors. honestly it’s not for everyone (and i’m still not sure how much i liked it myself) but i’m glad they’re having fun with it and trying to make drinks that might speak to a smaller audience"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Amazing drinks! Great shakshuka toast and egg sando.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"My husband and I are visiting SFO for the first time and we ordered from this place because of the reviews... Damn we were wrong. I'll leave a pic of the food below so you tell me if that's something you'd eat. Looks bad, tastes bad and it's overpriced.  Two stars because we also ordered moshi waffles and those were decent."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"This food has obviously been dropped and we’d never serve that to you that way. The photo is in a to go delivery box. Why would you think that this is normal?? If you order online, or aren’t careful with transportation, you’re going to have less than appealing products for our delicate food. We don’t deliver our own food, you either dropped it, or doordash/uber eats did. Blaming the restaurant is a silly response and patrons that dine at SPRO knows better."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"I feel like the coffee/specialty drinks can be hit or miss, and during peak times it can be hard to find seating.  As a cafe, their extensive food menu is pretty unique. They have more than just the typical cafe food of toast and sandwiches. I mean they also have toast and sandwiches, but they put their own fancy spin on things. I haven’t tried anything else because I ALWAYS get the avocado toast. It’s embarrassing how many times I’ve gotten the avocado toast since it feels like one of those things that I should just make at home. But this one is elevated. They call it the “umami bomb” and it has the perfect balance of savory, sweet and sour (from the ponzu, and ~umami~ (I think from truffle oil), and is topped with (optional) ikura roe. This is the epitome of the avocado toast."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Absolutely delicious food that blew my mind (loved everything but top favorites are Mash Up and Strawberry Guava Mochi Waffles). Best coffee hands down with extensive and unique menu. Wonderful service and wonderful people.  Living two blocks away is officially dangerous for my wallet.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Loved their single origin Ethiopian pour over coffee! I had it straight for three mornings. Food is tasty as well. I had toast and eggs and another pastry with eggs and bacon ,that I can't remember the name. Both were good. Small but great place to sit indoors or outdoors with your book, laptop etc."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Cute cafe/coffee shop in the Castro/Dolores area. My first experience with SPRO was in Mission Bay. This location is a full cafe. This location features a large selection of sandwiches, a few breakfast items, and a few pastries.  I tried a turkey sandwich and a Mardi Gras drink. The sandwich was large and had a good mix of meat and vegetables. It was a bit dry and could of used a little more mayo or dressing. But I figured I should be healthy so I didn’t ask for more. I wish the sandwich came with a little salad or pickle, or have the option for $1 more, but the sandwich alone was filling.  The cold brew drink was tasty! They specialize in creative coffee and tea drinks that you can’t find elsewhere. Instead of just adding a syrup, they use other items like reductions, herbs, sparkling water, and natural ingredients. I’d highly recommend trying one of their specialty drinks! I really enjoyed the cold brew. It’s hard to find a good, strong cold brew, and they nailed it.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to offer suggestions. You don’t see this type of service in most places.  My only wish is that they had more seating. But I’ll be back soon!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"The coffee and breakfast items we ordered were absolutely delicious! I tried the orange blossom coffee and shakshuka, my husband tried eggs and sausage. The shakshuka is so good that we ended up dunkin in the sausages in it as well. I highly recommend this place. Also great service and reasonably priced. The insides of the cafe itself is not much to look at, but if you are going for a good affordable breakfast, give this place a try, will not regret it!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Great concept, different from other coffee shops. I originally requested a cappuccino but then saw they had a menu of season specialities, I went for a warm ginger coffee and it was terrific! 🤩"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Stopped by here for a quick latte on my way to Dolores Park. We tried the Orange Blossom Latte which was quite good. Only downside is the lack of seating, which is quite limited."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Absurdly good pour over coffee (be a little patient), and a fancy coffee “cocktail” menu that I want to try everything on. Spoil your dog with their dog treat menu. Spoil yourself with their spiced chocolate coffee. Chat with the friendly owner. Spot on coffee shop!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Coffee lab and minimalist cafe...wonderful staff and even better coffee and pastries.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,I used to be an early customer of their Mission Bay food truck location and I’m so happy they opened this brick and mortar restaurant 🙌🏼  Finally visited them today and I loved that the flavors I used to be addicted to are still the same as they were almost 3 years ago ❤️  I chose my old time favorites: the mash-up and the umami bomb 🥰  They have more items than they used to and I have no doubt they’re all amazing!  Bonus point: the location is dog-friendly! 🐕
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,This place has the dopest bathroom in San Francisco.  The toilet's all futuristic and the music was thumping.   10/10 will definitely recommend and go back often.   The people were friendly and served good coffee too.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"one of the more inventive coffee places in the city with lots of unique options to try out. however, i was pretty disappointed with the drink I got. might try again to try the more simple coffees but not rushing to go back anytime soon.  service was also pretty bad - not only was it hard to get the workers attention, but they really acted like they didn’t want to be there  pixie dust: it tasted too strongly of the added ingredients and took away from the espresso itself."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Been going to the Soma location since it opened to treat myself, my wife and our dogs. Food and drinks here are amazing especially the waffles. But todays doggie treat was less then desirable. No rice added at all…"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,That's so sad to hear and incredibly embarrassed that we were still making the rice. Would you give us another try with a doggy meal on us?
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Made a quick stop here during the busy pride Sunday. My Mocha was prepared quick and tasted good. Just about everything was packed but luckily this place wasn’t cutting corners. 4.7/5.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Great coffee and brunch spot, with not so standard items on the food or drinks menu. I enjoyed my Tokyo matcha drink, that has rose syrup in it. As well as my toast with truffled mash potato and perfect eggs. The manager and rest of the team were all very friendly!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Loved the quality coffee here and wide variety of food and drink options. Sous vide sausage and eggs were amazing. Single origin pour over done well too.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,We tried the cappuccino and the cortado (called gibby on the menu) and both were absolutely amazing! 5/5
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Had a great Americano here. Also had the egg, cheddar, bacon pastry, which was good but (surprisingly) served cold. I heated it in a toaster oven and it tasted much better. Inside of the cafe is very white, almost a sterile vibe. Everything is quite expensive. Nice baristas, although it’s not especially quick."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"My absolute favorite spot. I was super sad the previous owner had to close during COVID but low and behold SPRO really brought the next level.  The coffee is excellent. I usually go for a spro and they have always been spot on. If you want some milk too, be prepared for some art and perfect temperature.  Their inventive side is more science than you'd think. The cold fashion is a celebration of flavors really bringing the essence across and not a mere imitation. I am not for anything in my coffee but at SPRO i do venture into it.  And their food happens to be spot on too. They use sugar sparingly, letting flavors speak for themselves. From the oatmeal to the umami bomb, go for it!  Great spot to spend some time and try some stuff indoor or out watching the trams and people flow by."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Expensive but sophisticated coffee. This place sets itself apart from your usual chain or run-of-the-mill coffee joint. Their flavors are very unique!  We ordered the Cold Fashioned and Mardi Gras. Cold Fashioned was lightly sweetened with an orange peel burnt and infused to the coffee. The Mardi Gras was a tad sweet but reminded me of a toned down version of the ""Orleans"" coffee drink from Blue Bottle Coffee. Both are excellent"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Incredible coffee shop and cafe. The most innovative coffee drinks you’ve ever had, AND incredible food. I walk a mile once a week to go here. You have to try it"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"This is the only place in San Francisco that deserves a perfect 5 star rating. They do everything right from their incredible customer service to their food, dog menu, aesthetic, and even their bathroom. I wish I found this place in the first day of my trip."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Was informed as a first time patron about the name and the specialities. I enjoyed being able to interact with the staff members and the rest of the folks inside were doing their thing but interacted in a friendly environment. I got the fifty shades and I'd definitely come back and get more.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Spro Coffee Lab is the Jam! I firmly believe there are no rules to coffee, only best practices. Spro has fun. Coffee is supposed to be fun so chill out, order a few drinks and take your time with this place or you might miss out. They have a lot to offer the the coffee community. They’ve experimented for our enjoyment!  Cheers Spro Coffee Labs!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Busy shop, but good coffee especially for those who are fans of blue bottle type coffee. There are so many options for coffee and food. I look forward to returning."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Something new happening with the cafe idea for San Francisco. Modern minimalist white interior. Almost everyone there working on their laptops. Nobody over 30. Near a high school so some students too.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Spro is a hip coffee bar along Church Street corridor. They offer the classic coffee drinks, tea and chai with choices of milk. Their special drink menu offers coffee mixology magic! Their combos read like a composed dish. I came in for a cold chai with almond milk. Got a brown butter chocolate chip cookie 🍪 too. The patrons are hipsters with their dogs 🐶. Def the Mission District set looking to people watch. And this is a nice sunny spot! There are two tables out in front providing a great watchers perspective. Spro has a huge glass front for natural light. Will come back for a Hong Kong milk tea or Strawberry Fields (has muddled strawberries!). Breakfast food looks tasty too! Impressed!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Delicious oats and a large portion. Tasty coffees. Lots of different food choices from snacks to larger bites.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"This is the first physical location for the SPRO coffee truck in Mission Bay, and if that is any indication, this new location is going to be AMAZING! (Open July 10) Can’t wait to see what the owners have done with their first brick and mortar store.  Here’s some of what you can expect, based on my extensive experience at their Mission Bay location.  Service: Very friendly and they love dogs! (in mission bay there is a menu for your pups!)  Food & Drinks: Creative and delicious. You can’t go wrong with what you choose, but if it sounds different, I recommend trying it! I’ve sampled food and drinks across their menu at Spark SF, and there are plenty of delicious espresso, tea, mocktails, and food options to try!  Atmosphere: Laid back. I have no idea what kind of music they play in their mission bay location, but it makes their corner of the Spark food truck park feel like it’s own little oasis of a coffeeshop.  TLDR: You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu. This lovely team is expanding locations and are creative geniuses with their food and drink options.  While I encourage you to try a variety of options from their menu, my personal favorites are the Kat’s Pajamas and salmon bagel sandwich. Enjoy!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Very unique bistro coffee shop, another hidden gem that’s open early enough in the morning to catch on my way to work. On the corner of 17th street/ 500 Church. Drove by around 7:30 am and had to turn around. It definitely beats the Starbucks train which doesn’t satisfy my thirst for an intentional brew - I ended up getting a drip coffee over 2 shots w/a splash of white chocolate & a morning smoothie called Urban Jungle & a Strawberry Guava pillow pastry.!! YUMMM  (Urban Jungle - Kale, spinach, chard, Banana, coconut, pineapple and Honey! *Strawberry Guava Pillow- exactly that. A soft crispy/flaky pastry w/ a generous amount of sliced strawberries atop a Guava blanket of nectar! -Red Eye coffee w/ white chocolate)  I’ll be back again. The staff was pleasant and welcoming ❤️"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"This place has lots of fun drink options. The food is also great, especially the mash up and the chocolate chip cookies!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Good coffee but service could've been better - faster to be specific, they took around 15 mins to serve us our coffee to go. I'd still go back to try the food and other drinks"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Great selection of interesting coffee and tea drinks!
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Rarely give five stars but the lattes are phenomenal. Great seating area inside and out to catch up with a friend. Close to mission delores park for a quick walk. Great pastries and breakfast sandwiches as well!
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Great corner spot with lots of sunshine! Coffee and food is delish.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Some really cool coffee cocktails! Had the sangria (they make it nonalcoholic with an espresso shot) and it was amazing. Really good fruity vibe
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"A few days ago randomly found this place and I loved it. Their Latte is amazing. Friendly staff, great location!! Highly recommending!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Great central location in the mission and delicious drinks!
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"My wife had one of the best decaf lattes from here today.  It was Madagascar vanilla decaf latte with oat milk and she found it to be quite delicious (perfectly balanced sweetness with a touch of honey and the oat milk).  She has challenges getting a good flavour from other places since she is avoiding caffeine and dairy, but they get it right here.  Also she is enjoying trying their wide menu of subtle and tasty flavours."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Probably the best kept secret of the cafe world.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Really great drinks, food, and atmosphere. The people are super nice too."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Great pour over coffee with some nice outdoor seating. The umami bomb can easily be made vegan and it is DELICIOUS!  🌎sustainability rating: 4 out of 5. Better than most coffee shops. They used real cups for coffee for dine in and the food was all served with reusable utensils and dinnerware.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,they have a wide variety of specialty lattes and all of the ones I’ve tried have been quite good
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Spro has great drinks, ambiance, and wifi!  My favorites are the Madagascar vanilla latte and the After School chocolate smoothie."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Great food and options! Coffee was great too
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,pretty mediocre coffee for the price. staff is overbearing and enthusiastic which can be awkward when i just want a drink quickly. also no barista has ever called espresso “spro” that i’ve ever known. not saying it doesn’t happen but it just feels cringe.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"While I can't speak to your experience, the terminology Spro has been around for more than a decade in Specialty coffee. I'd suggest doing some research on Google on what spro stands for. It is a slang, for those who are in the specialty coffee industry. If you're a Starbucks connoisseur, you'll never hear the term. We don't make the drink until you order it, nothing special here but we're not fast food. We don't premake anything. There are lots of green aproned shops for that. We do hope that people notice our work. We continue aiming to serve those who have discerning palates, those that appreciate our effort in attention to detail, serving the highest quality coffee there is to offer. If you're ready to try specialty coffee again, ask a barista if they know what spro means. If they don't, walk out."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Sous Vide eggs are cooked perfectly. Specialty drink menu is unique and extensive. Good service. Will return.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Cute coffee shop near Dolores Park. Great spot to catch up with a friend or have a nice drink
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Today I randomly stumbled in here and had the Pixie Dust latte and let me tell you it is a bougie latte person’s dream! I can honestly say this was one of the best and most interesting lattes I have ever had. Many layers of delicious flavors and ingredients, no dairy, super smooth espresso, it was a work of art. This place is new to the neighborhood and I can honestly predict that it  will be a hit among the complex palates of San Franciscans. I just selfishly hope I won’t have to start waiting in the famous San Francisco line around the block, even though it will be a testament to how special this shop is."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,I wish I got the names of the two sweet baristas that spoke to my fiancé and I while visiting San Francisco. We stumbled across Spro and decided to give it a chance but were definitely skeptical reading some of the drink names. Trust them they have great recommendations!! I am still thinking about the Pixie Dust I ordered. The baristas were speaking to us as they made the drinks and gave us so many great recommendations on what we should with the rest of our day. We took their advice and got a view of the city at Bernal Heights and went to the dumpling place as well; their hospitality was great and when I visit again I’m absolutely stopping at Spro again
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Drinks are interesting and look tasty, but we had to leave without ours (after paying) because it took 25+ minutes for them to be made and there was no sign of them coming out anytime soon. I think they should let people know when ordering if they’re behind  Edit: our friends who stuck around checked in a few times and after ~50min and they said they never got the order (but our cards were charged) and remade them"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Hi Michael, sorry to hear about your experience. We are trying our best to keep up while being short staffed. You're right, we generally give a wait time between 10-15 minutes when we get really busy. But we generally do not take 25+ minutes. On occasion people do snag other people's drinks. Would it be possible that someone may have taken your drinks?"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Top notch! Delicious and interesting food options (umami toast, egg and prosciutto bagel...blueberry mochi waffles.,) All were so delicious Drink options spanned an array of coffees and teas that were also interesting and unique, with classic options as well. I liked the clean interior and good behind the counter service. Will def go back"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Used to visit their truck over in Mission Bay. Thrilled to have them in the Mission now. Always a good pull of espresso - currently it looks like their using B&W beans which is my absolute favorite. Good assortment of food and dog friendly.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Slowest coffee in a day with no line. Tasted just milk.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Hi Sdan, we actually have very active online orders so your having a line or not may not decrease wait time. Our coffees are carefully picked for service, and it’s no secret that people love our work. Seems like your experience is an odd one out. We absolutely wish that we can be that perfect cafe for you. In the future, when you receive something less than satisfactory, it is smarter to ask for something else. Otherwise you’re stuck with it! Our coffees are generally lighter roast, but we’re able to create something more palatable for your preference. Hopefully you come back and try other other things on the menu and actually let us know what you think. Thanks for your support!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Yum 10/10 would recommend the Japanese strawberry guava mochi
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Really like their rose matcha! They have other flavored espresso drinks that looked well. The ambiance is nice and hip as well
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Beautiful, smart-looking neighborhood coffee shop with delicious coffee and tea and a super-friendly staff. It's wonderful to have such a friendly, high quality and aesthetically pleasing coffee shop as a new addition to the neighborhood! Welcome!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Such a great place. The coffee is fabulous and they have many unique drinks. The staff are personable and so knowledgeable about their craft which makes visiting here an exceptional experience.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Amazing service! The baristas really know their coffee, and clearly spent a lot of time and passion into curating their craft. Would definitely come back just to try their entire seasonal menu."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Five ⭐️ for the owner taking care of his employees shows that great service comes from caring management. If I ever go to SF will definitely swing by Rich tracked down the person trying to steal his employees car and put himself in harms way to take care of his employees and get the car back to him. Wham Baam it’s the Tesla tracker man. 💪🏼💯💯
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Super friendly and gluten free options. I tried the Mashup on GF bread and the Cool Hunter, but with half calf espresso instead of cold brew (yeah I'm a treat, but they rolled with it). Both were deeply satisfying. Try the Cool Hunter with espresso -the crema adds something lovely."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Pretty good place with really treat pull pork sandwich!
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Clean space that’s almost aggressively bright white. Music loud enough to not want to stay long.  Feels it should be in a tourist area where folks want some quick glitz. If that’s what the area around Dolores Park is turning into, the business may do well. It’s not a neighborhood coffee corner shop, though."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Hi Ben, thanks for your feedback. We've only ever been a neighborhood coffee shop and we've finally just built our second location in Mission Dolores. Our aim is definitely no tourism so we apologize if our theme is uncomfortable for you. We prefer working in an environment that's clean and minimalistic. We don't play classical nor do we play jazz like many coffee shops. We curate our own music that our baristas enjoy listening to. Ultimately what matters most is that you enjoyed your coffee, food and pastries as that's what we are about at the core. Aesthetics are subjective. Thanks for understanding and we hope to make your future visit stellar."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Lovely coffee shop with great beans and abundant seating. Highly recommend!
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"There’s good food, and then there’s EXCELLENT food. Every dish we’ve ever had from SPRO has been excellent. Wide variety on the menu as well, so everyone can find something they like."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"cool cafe, very interesting coffee/tea drinks, peaceful corner to get some work done"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Their iced oat milk latte is surprisingly rich and nuanced. My first thought was that they had accidentally given me a mocha, but this is coffee that literally has ""hints of chocolate"" in its flavor."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"There’s a meme about the Disney movie Tarzan’s soundtrack, how “Phil Collins didn’t have to go that hard, but he did it for us.” That’s what SPRO did for me.  The Mardi Gras (24hr Cold Brew, Chicory, Cane Sugar, Milk) was the best cold brew drink I’ve had, outside Kona cold brew made on the farm itself.  The Breakfast Sandwich is perfectly executed. I haven’t had egg salad in 25 years and I will only have it here. I guarantee combination of flavors is going to be copied within weeks.  The Mash Up is…just get it. You don’t need to ask, I don’t need to tell you. Get it. Now (except if you’re vegan).  Few things are more refreshing than Strawberry Fields. The depth of flavors, wow."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,the drinks and pastries here are SO good. super friendly staff too
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Great coffee and chai. Food is just alright, though."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,very good coffee and staff were very friendly
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"I am sure the espresso here is very good, but SPRO painted right over the neighborhood's favorite mural of bears on bikes to whitewash the entire storefront, which was super sad. It would be so great to let a bit of the community shine through here, rather than matching the same sterile aesthetic of every other high end coffee spot."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"We loved this mural! I think you must've been misinformed. This story was covered by Hoodline earlier in May 2021. Graffiti artist came to vandalize the mural before we signed a lease on the space. We were in talks with the artist, who had access to a power washer and thought it would be a nice gesture from all sides to help clean up vandalism. But then, someone who lived in the neighborhood showed their disappreciation for the vandalism and threw house paint over the graffiti, not realizing that the previous tenant had anti-graffiti paint protective coating and all it needed was a power wash. The management group tried to save it but the house paint caused permanent damage. It was then decided that it would be painted white to match our decor in the front.  The team and the people that work here, including the community are incredible. People are passionate and love their jobs. We're very fortunate to be here because we care very much about what we do. I'd appreciate it if you can leave a review based on what we can control, our products and our services. Not because of something that was damaged and repainted before we moved into the building. If you're a supporter of the community, come in and see what we're about. Hopefully we'd surprise you with the incredible amount of care and detail that this neighborhood deserves."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"For the coffee purists, try the specialty varietal pour over coffees (not the complex drinks). Sous vide eggs and sausages were very good and filling (should be shared)."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"I’m an extremely hard to please coffee drinker - this place is absolutely fantastic, perfection. Just tried the food for the first time too - superb, run don’t walk to visit this cafe 🏃🏻‍♂️ …"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Overrated- coffee was like furnace temperature, have only have like 3 options- charge 6 bucks for a latte and it’s just boiled milk. Service is poor you want to dine in but get paper cup!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"You must have gotten the review for the wrong cafe. Our milk steam is usually at 130°F and we feel the pitchers with our hand. Instead of three options, we have over 70. If you do not ask for dine in, we do not default to dine in without your vaccine card. If we were really the cafe that you left this review for, we would love the opportunity to correct  it."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Fantastic craft combinations with expert espresso pulls and delicious food. What a win! Vegan options too! Thank you Spro team and Rich.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,It was pleasant to be there and coffee was good and so is strawberry people . Two baristas always were super nice !
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Excellent coffee and really friendly staff. I recommend choosing this place over Peet's or Starbucks any day. It's worth the extra 3 minute walk.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Delicious and reasonably priced coffee and eats (I even found one of my fav roasters here), plus super friendly staff.  Highly recommend!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Nice place to come try new things like sous vide sausages
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"If I had all the money in the world, I'd get a SPRO drink every morning. They are so decadent and delicious! This place has some quality food and bevvies 100%"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Best breakfast sandwich I've found in the neighborhood. Maybe in the city.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Really great, truly inventive coffee drinks (but not Starbucks-y at all). Plus the classics you'd expect with very friendly service."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Great coffee shop! Owner will chase down your stolen car with his Tesla Model Y.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"waited 30 minutes for the salmon breakfast sandwich (bread dry as hell) and veggie tales (decent, lacked flavor). it wasn't that busy."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Hi Mariel, this is embarrassing. Truth is, we are facing a staffing crisis due to the pandemic and we're trying our hardest to keep staffed during the pandemic. We have an extremely limited team and they're trying their best to keep up. Hopefully, you can give us a try again, we aim to be better."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,I had a pour over that was pretty tasty but I had to wait 15 minutes for it even though there was just a trickle of customers. This would be a good spot if it was more reliable.
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Totally fair point. We're working hard at staffing and we've been having a difficult time. The market has not been so forgiving to us. In the meantime, we strive on making sure that we make each drink/meal with intent, focusing on quality first. We've trained our team to take our time, as long as we make it right.  No one wants to have a mediocre drink for $6-7. Unlike our green aproned colleagues, we're not so focused on speed. But you're absolutely right. We mustn't forget that long wait time is part of the experience and there needs to be a method between wait time and quality that we need to seek after. Hopefully, you could give us a try again and know that we're doing our best to get your drink done in a timely manner, but never sacrificing quality."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"The pixie is a fave drink, now. Sous vide sausages and eggs were delicious as well."
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Nice coffee place just sit, hang out, read a book and they serve an awesome cappuccino"
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Fantastic! Best coffee in SF! The variety is great, atmosphere spot on, food delicious."

SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,Food is expensive and bad quality
SPRO - Mission Dolores/Castro,"Sorry you had a bad experience but our food is very high quality. We cook the sausages for 12 hours, they're pink on the inside on purpose. Eggs are cooked for 4 hours. They're soft poached and spreadable like butter. Toast is fresh baked sourdough, either by Neighbor Bakehouse or Tartine (both are famous artisan bakeries in San Francisco). Looking at your photo, I assume you just didn't know what you were getting and we apologize for not having properly explained to you. Our quality is top notch and we cook almost 24 hours a day to prepare for service. Hopefully you'll come back and try again with an open mind."
