Blue Bottle Coffee,"Quality craft coffee brand (that has been subsequently gobbled up by a multi-National conglomerate) that serves proper shots.  Good to see that the core brand has been maintained in spite of the Nestle acquisition.  Quality, consistent products that are artfully crafted by employees who take the craft seriously (can border on pretentious at times).  Convenient location very close to the UCSF Mission Bay campus and hospitals."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I've never had Blue Bottle before so I didn't really know what to order. I randomly chose the NOLA iced coffee and geez, that was one of the best coffees I've ever had. It tasted like a Carmel candy, but not super sweet. Also the egg breakfast sandwich was great too. I can't wait to go back."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Awesome coffee!  After trying this coffee I understood why Blue Bottle Coffee is a favorite for many people.  Coffee is perfectly roasted and brewed and has perfect balance of flavors. I tried their Cappuccino and seasonal special - Date Latte. Both were delicious.  They didn’t have indoor seating at this location. However, they have a patio so you can sit outdoors.  I felt price is little high when compared to Starbucks. Date Latte was 7$ for a size comparable to Grande. However, the taste of the coffee makes it worth it!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"WiFi: Yes (open wifi w/o password, you have to provide your email and zip code to access it)  Restroom: yes, one  Food recommendations: haven’t had anything other than the liege waffle but if you haven’t tried it you should  Drink recommendations: I’ve had sweet latte before which was good, and I always like New Orleans-style iced coffee (what Blue Bottle is famous for) but I’ve been ordering warm drinks since it’s slightly chilly every time I walk down to Blue Bottle. Hojicha latte (tastes like matcha latte but with slightly more bitter/green tea taste) was surprisingly very good, and regular latte with almond milk is also good.  Review: Clean place facing Spark Social SF.  There are four individual tables for one/two people, four-seat area facing the window, and a relatively big table that is able to sit 6 people (though I haven’t seen more than two people use that space). There is also a lot of outdoor seating. I see people with dogs come in and order food/drinks and sit outside and enjoy the weather all the time.  I love the liege waffle (I’ve had a ton of these in NY in different locations as well and I’m surprised how exactly the same these taste across the country!). I’ve had latte with almond milk (they charge $1 for almond milk, as opposed to most other places that charge $.50 for almond milk) and hojicha latte. I thought hojicha latte was especially really good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great blue bottle location and vibe - tons of space indoor and outdoors to work and has free wifi if needed!  Location - right next to spark social, so you can work here and then grab a bite to eat at one of the food trucks!  Wifi - Doing a speed test, it has 4mbps down and 0.5mbps up, which should be fine for browsing and work.  Coffee - similar to other blue bottle locations and is pretty good.  Outlets - only downside here is that I didn't spot any power outlets, so make sure to come fully charged  Really like this location and is in a beautiful area."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"First visit to Blue Bottle - staff here seemed genuinely warm and welcoming. Food and drink order was provided quickly and as ordered.  Saw a few people come in taking advantage of the mobile ordering.  Seating, both inside and outside was well spaced so we felt COVID safe.  Bathrooms were locked - employees provided code - bathrooms were clean and spacious."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Usually the blue bottle service is great but the service at this location was bad. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with 2 coffees and an olive twist. The coffee was not hot enough and the remake of the coffee was made ignoring dietary instructions. The food was not heated properly as well.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Coffee is delicious, just like every Blue Bottle I've been to. I had an iced latte with oat milk.  Nice staff. Sleek interior with wooden elements."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Beans used to be cheaper than at the market, and fresher roast date"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really like the coffee, drinks, and atmosphere; but. They don’t have cinnamon or chocolate powder that would make the drinks stand out.  Honestly, I’m a bit confused by this. I’ve not ever been in a coffeehouse that didn’t have. I’ll probably wait to return unfortunately because it’s in the details."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Extremely nice staff and fast service. Great location to walk to and ample outdoor seating at the shop as well as nearby.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Love latte here! Bright and cozy place
Blue Bottle Coffee,"What can I say about blue bottle that's never been said. In my experience, the coffee has a richer taste. A bit more full than the rest of the coffee shops. I guess it's subjective but I like their coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Strange welcome: mumbly and undecided. No decaf. Shorter than expected wait. Perhaps a slower pour over would develop deeper flavors in the coffee. I'll try again.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee. Stop closing early. I'm just going to assume you close at 3 now.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This is one of my favourite blue bottle locations. The staff is friendly, the coffee (that I order on the blue bottle app) is always ready on time for a quick pick-up on my way to work. Dog friendly and has space to work."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Everything was clean and promptly served,  coffee great. Two little things: * chocolate croissant should be heated - the server should ask * the restroom number lock doesn’t show if it’s vacant, so people outside try to punch in the code beep-beep while you trying to have privacy inside"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great place to relax and grab coffee  before minigolf.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Beautiful location with a large patio that offers outdoor chairs and tables setup to provide a respite in the middle of a pandemic.  Since this is their 3rd week into opening it seems like they are still getting staffed up as a few times I went there were only 2 people behind the counter and multiple drink orders to be fulfilled.  I'm sure this will improve, but the staff is always friendly and professional.  Dress in layers if you visit the patio as it is SF weather and occasionally there is a breeze."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I didn't like their espresso at all, it tasted too sour. But that might be just me. The croissant thing was fine, but overpriced. Nice interior and staff though."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your espresso, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,My sister took me here too have a catch up mental check in day..and they barista was super cool and actually introduced us too blue bottle coffee and now I'm hooked the doggy friendly environment makes it absolutely adorable too get a strong drink of how and some cute doggo fuzziea
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Beautiful and convenient brand new location, so sad I just moved out of the neighborhood! But I was recently in the area, fast and kind service, enjoyed it. With Spark across the street as a food and drinks hub I think it'll be a successful store. Wishing them all the best."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I just had an exquisite cappuccino here. Blue bottle really does a great job, from coffee selection to roasting to prep."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Slow service and food was mediocre.  Will not return to this location.

Blue Bottle Coffee,Must visit if you're in SF. Their espresso and green tea drinks are superb. Don't miss their chia/dried fruit overnight oats.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great cappuccino. Matcha latte could use some more matcha for flavor, a bit bland. Nice staff and bets out sbuxs anyday of the week."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Quick service, really nice espresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee! Good staff. Good pastries! There's a line for a reason, so be sure to snag a drink and a snack before it gets too late!"
