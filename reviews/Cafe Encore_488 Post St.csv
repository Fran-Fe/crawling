Cafe Encore,Aye man great place! Just takes a long time but aye it’s great! Best  croissants I had!
Cafe Encore,"I came here this morning, because I'd rather support small businesses than starbucks. I was the third in line. I waited 20 minutes, until i was able to order (still fine, the lady was alone). I ordered a 12oz Cappuccino (~350ml - for the rest of the world) and an Eggsy Croissant.  Then I waited another 5 minutes until it was ready. I'm from Europe and not familiar with OZ, but I thought, oh ok that's a small cup and why is it so light. So I looked at the bottom of the cup, which said 8oz (~250ml) and then I looked inside - just half full (~120ml)!!! No milkfoam at all (see photo).  When I went back in to complain, the lady told me, a cappuccino is with just a little bit of milk and the size of the cup doesn't matter. I said, how is it possible to order 12oz and receive a half full 8oz cup?!?! As the café was full, I didn't want the other costumers to wait, just because I was scammed. But I would definitly NOT recommend this place! Even though the croissant was good. 4oz of ""cappuccino"", when you paid for 12oz."
Cafe Encore,My favorite cafe in San Fran. The lady at the counter was so sweet and kind and remembered me from a prior day. I love her tea lattes with honey. My husband liked the vanilla lattes with espresso. We had also prior gotten maple and chocolate doughnuts. They also have breakfast sandwiches and bagels and tarts.
Cafe Encore,"Nice little place to grab breakfast or lunch, either to eat in or to go. Quaint with a Parisian theme and relaxing oldies music. Has a good selection of sandwiches, including breakfast sandwiches on bagels or croissants, beverages including coffees/teas and cold drinks, salads, and desserts. Friendly, fast service."
Cafe Encore,"This place is so cute it reminds me of a Paris Cafe well this is decorated that way the people behind the counter are berries nice good customer service clean place. Very tiny inside good food decent prices considering it is downtown Post Street to be exact. I had the roast beef sandwich and it was really good little heavy on a horseradish so if you don't care for horseradish I'd let them know if I was you. They also have fancy coffees, they also have pastries like macarons, danishes and whatnots like that and the macarons are very good. So if you're ever down on Post Street I'd recommend this place they have healthy portions good sandwiches also salads."
Cafe Encore,Loved the coziness. The coffee was of authentic taste (know before you order as we are more used to different artificial tastes). The sandwich they gave (we ordered one chicken sandwich only) was more than enough for two people and tasted delicious. The desserts were too cute to be eaten and the staff was very nice. Not pricey at all.
Cafe Encore,"Encore Cafe is a small cozy place that serves breakfast and lunch sandwiches, salads, and desserts (pastries and ice cream) besides hot and cold beverages. I enjoy sitting here listening to music when it’s not busy."
Cafe Encore,"Stopped by for a quick bite, the food did take a little longer than I would’ve liked but there was only one person working that morning so I can understand. It was empty so we were easily able to get a table. Breakfast sandwiches are served all day, I got an egg & cheese on a bagel (it was good) and a frappe (that was delicious)."
Cafe Encore,The location is good. The service is great. I got the scrambled eggs with latte. The latte tasted burned a little. The eggs were amazing. The place looks ok. Will probably come again.
Cafe Encore,"Cozy cafe with a ton of food options, and a great alternative to the hotel breakfast. Staff was very friendly and the prices are reasonable for SF."
Cafe Encore,"Great low key, inexpensive, family run cafe. If you’re downtown and up early and want a nice little local vibe check this place out."
Cafe Encore,"This place will always be one of our special memories of San Francisco, visiting from Australia in 2017 and 2019, and from current reviews it's still as good as ever. The coffee was great, the made to order sandwiches outstanding, and the service was friendly and obliging. A frequent venue for breakfast, morning tea or lunch. Just special memories forever."
Cafe Encore,"Best breakfast menu in Union Square. Great prices. Ate here on business 3 years ago and  I’m back again. Orange juice is fresh squeezed, breakfast sandwich is so good and fresh!"
Cafe Encore,"Coffee was awful, extremely hot and bitter.. service wasn’t much better unfortunately"
Cafe Encore,"Easy menu with a tasty range, polite staff and a soothing atmosphere 👌 …"
Cafe Encore,"Very nice workers! Coffee was good, pricey in general. Did not order any food but their case of desserts were ordered often and looked fresh! would go back to do work and have a coffee for long period of time"
Cafe Encore,"Yuuummmmmy! But for real, exceeded expectations for an unplanned quick stop to snack and cafffinate :)"
Cafe Encore,i love this place. reminds me of the cafe in fleabag if you've seen this show. very sweet people and yummy cold brew :) 10/10 favorite cafe in the city. studying here is such a nice feeling.
Cafe Encore,"We tried out their grilled cheese delivery business on ubereats/doordash.  We ordered two grilled cheeses. Neither was actually grilled. The bread wasn't even buttered/greased -- it was literally just cold, white toast. Cold, white, SOGGY toast, because they packed the drinks I ordered directly on top of the sandwiches. Needless to say the cheese wasn't melted when it arrived, but based on how it looked, I am willing to bet it never was.  One of the sandwiches was supposed to contain a fried egg and bacon. Instead of a fried egg, it contained cold scrambled eggs for some reason (prolly messed up the fried egg?). The ""bacon"" was that instant, pre-cooked, shelf stable, microwave bacon you see outside the refrigerator isle in supermarkets. The struggle bacon was as cold as the cheese, egg, and toast were. This one also randomly contained diced tomatoes (why diced!?!?!?) which seemed to be past their freshness date and did nothing but make the bread even soggier.  Maybe their in store offerings are better -- but if they are capable of messing up two grilled cheeses that badly, I don't need to try anything else from their kitchen.  This cost me $47.91 btw. Two failed grilled cheeses and 2 cans of coke."
Cafe Encore,Great chai tea and coffee. Great service too
Cafe Encore,"While staying in San Francisco, we enjoyed a daily breakfast here- Staff are great, friendly and helpful. Coffee spot on! Pastries, cakes  and sandwiches all fresh and delicious- Great for takeout and sitting in!"
Cafe Encore,"Cute little cafe that once had the most beautiful woman working there. 20+ years later I brought that same woman back for breakfast. She is still beautiful.  The cafe itself is lovely, good selection, very yummy iced chocolate drink that we highly recommend."
Cafe Encore,"Tiny little cafe but if you are near stop in for some macaroons(mango is my fave), a panini, or a cappuccino, you'll be glad you did."

Cafe Encore,Sorry but I got food poisoning here. Don't order salad.
Cafe Encore,"Small cafe with great coffee and a good selection of breakfast options.  It can get busy, and it's usually a two person show, so the wait can be longer than one would like."
Cafe Encore,"Didn’t have the food here, but the owner was so helpful and nice when I came in after my car was towed on Post! Thank you and buy your coffee here because they are so nice!"
