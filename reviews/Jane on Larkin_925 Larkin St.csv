Jane on Larkin,Tomato basil soup is absolutely good.  The ham and egg croissant is also awesome.  The vegetable smoothie is wonderful.  Highly recommend order ahead so you don't miss out.
Jane on Larkin,Thought $12 for this little guy buy I have to say it's pretty hearty and I am a fan of the tomato jam!
Jane on Larkin,Best brekkie burrito I’ve ever had. Great crew working there 🤙
Jane on Larkin,"Great little bakery in the Tenderloin.  Went early in a Sunday so not too sketch.  I had the almond milk chia pudding. It was unsweetened with berries,  tasted very good"
Jane on Larkin,"Cheap and overpriced. $17 dollars smoked salmon toast used to come into two large pieces, now it’s just one small piece. Never again. Go waste your money somewhere else."
Jane on Larkin,"Finally found an open local bakery to have breakfast after walking a few block from our hotel. We had their French toast (which was Amazing!) and a Ham/Egg/Cheese breakfast sandwich on a croissant. I added avocado and was pleased to see half the avocado on it! Turned out to be a Great sandwich. I wasn't impressed with my double espresso, the espresso was sour/sharp tasting even with them adding some simple syrup. Overall, I'd eat here again.."
Jane on Larkin,"Favorite new bakery in San Francisco. What a fine, will definitely go back next time I am in the city. Healthy and yummy. Love the avocado toast and all the salads I tried were tasty. Yummy bread and delicious coffee."
Jane on Larkin,"Jane on Larkin is a hidden gem, although in one of the sketchiest parts of The Loin. The food is amazing and the service is always quality. I have eaten here probably 5-7 times so I’m always trying something new. The sausage biscuit is a personal favorite although not pictured below. I would say one this they need to be more efficient with is seating, the seats are just there with a first come style. Which works unless it’s really crowded.  This time I opted for the mission un-smoothie which was a solid breakfast burrito, could of had a little more flavor but the content of what’s in it gives it a solid B+.  The spicy baked eggs I would say is something you eat just to get you going for the day, not the most fulfilling meal, but delicious especially with the toast on the side."
Jane on Larkin,"Tried the peanut butter banana toast and the egg sandwich, both are solid choices. The staff was approachable and helpful! The space is airy and colorful. Would recommend for a quick breakfast."
Jane on Larkin,"Great location for breakfast & brunch. Freshly baked bread and croissants. Nice cappuccino. Rich menu including a choice of salads, toasts, some classics and a variety of healthy juices.  The staff is generally fast with taking orders and service, but this place can get quite busy around noon, so some waiting may be required to get a seat."
Jane on Larkin,"I really liked the menu options they had! Sandwich had good flavor! I enjoyed the iced mocha, as well. Not the best coffee I've ever had but it was really good for non-coffee shop coffee. The blonde girl who took my order and brought me my food was very nice. The portion size is good, I only ate half the sandwich and was full."
Jane on Larkin,"First time at Jane and we loved it. Delicious food, coffee, tea. The staff is very friendly. The bread is homemade. Avocado mash with poached egg, peanut butter and banana toast, fresh fruits and yogurt, everything is yummy."
Jane on Larkin,"Thoughtful service, with Jane Bakery accolades clear in all their food, paired with great drinks (including chai and green smoothie). Fillmore spot a go-to w much better neighborhood as well."
Jane on Larkin,"Stick to coffee, baked goods, and the sandwiches. Any cowboy would be ashamed to be associated with the cowboy salad. A more appropriate name would be the City Slicker Salad. The chicken was cold, didn’t taste like bbq, and the corn and beans were sprinkled on like salt and pepper. Last time I got the Club Sandwich, that was really good. Also avoid the rainbow salad. It’s basically spinach and carrots."
Jane on Larkin,"My boss took me here to lay me off.  Great vibe, and I did enjoy my last company coffee.  Maybe not as many vegan items as I would like."
Jane on Larkin,"First time !!! Ordered the turkey panine, sadly did not have turkey, got the next best thing ham. Delicious with the latte I got. Service was exceptional and fast. I need to try this place again."
Jane on Larkin,"Wow has this place gone downhill! When I lived nearby a decade ago, this was a favorite cafe. No longer!  The food used to be delicious - now it's meh. No wifi, on purpose. Staff are cheerless and all wearing Covid muzzles.  Unsurprisingly, there were few customers."
Jane on Larkin,This was a great coffee shop! I only got Chia pudding (amazing with tons of berries and granola and sweet pudding. Not to watery like most) It was reasonably  priced (for chia pudding in the city that is) and the staff were extremely friendly.  Friend got a coffee there and it was pretty good. Normal roast was a bit dark and not too sweet.  tables were nice and spread out with room to work on laptops or books easily and not be too disturbed.
Jane on Larkin,"A great bakery/coffee shop in the tender-nob area of San Francisco. They have a variety of delicious salads, sandwiches and AMAZING pastries/desserts!"
Jane on Larkin,"It always feels surreal sitting in a nice place looking out into the streets of Tenderloin... Some call it a respite, I feel it's quite sad and sobering but hey, a girl's gotta eat. Had read some negative reviews before but I think management improved things because service and our food were fine, not spectacular but not bad. The french toast stood out with its fluffiness and butteriness. The berry coulis definitely elevated it too. Portion size was ok, enough but not large. Prices a little high for a place in the 'loin for the more substantial dishes ($13-15). The space was welcoming and chill with lots of semi-interesting menu items so reason to come back to try them (and the baked goods) at least!"
Jane on Larkin,I walked by this place several times before I caught my eye and it was well worth the stop. The cold brew is dark strong and smooth. The fact that they even have gluten free deserts is amazing and their deliciousness is icing on the cake (pun intended). I will be back.
Jane on Larkin,Coffee could be better but had an egg white spinach avocado toast with Sriracha butter spread which was yummy! Will pop in again if I’m around the area!
Jane on Larkin,"Cute coffee shop. I had the smoke salmon platter and my friend had the egg sandwich, it was good but pricey. Everything tasted fresh and the coffee was delicious. Its the city so dont freak out if you visiting San Francisco and you see alot of homeless around this area, they are harmless."
Jane on Larkin,The mango chicken salad sandwich was quite the treat! Flavorful like you wouldn't believe! Let my photo tingle your tongue!  P.S. Iced Chai and iced matcha are ones for the ages as well!
Jane on Larkin,"Yummy like all other Jane's. This one does not have wifi though so if you want to sit and chill and do some work, go to the one on Fillmore. Otherwise it's a good quick bite spot  not far from the new hospital. Neighborhood can be sketchy if you walk over though,  so beware."
Jane on Larkin,Decent coffee. Needs better and more rest rooms. Staff are in there half the time instead of customers which is annoying
Jane on Larkin,Good food but not the best avocado I already ate 😉 and the chia pudding would be more perfect with additional honey or butter toping on demand …
Jane on Larkin,"Love this espresso house respite in the Tenderloin ‘hood. Picked up a fresh loaf of sourdough farm bread, handmade at their local shop. Ordered a Gibraltar (wet macchiato) with a sparkling water back. Great vibe, cool staff."
Jane on Larkin,"A wonderful little café and bakery. They have a decent menu with enough options for everyone. Their coffee is great and food, quite delicious. This place is great for a quick bite or drink."
Jane on Larkin,"Former coworker recommended visiting Jane after I told her that I was desperate to find a nice coffee. Coffee was great, but I’ll be coming back for the baked goods! Great service and friendly staff."
Jane on Larkin,"Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and a couple drinks beyond the normal coffee shop expectation, such as the tasty turmeric tonic. I tried the black charcoal detox latte, with activated charcoal, raw cacao, coconut, chaga, reishi mushroom, and two shots of espresso added. It did not disappoint."
Jane on Larkin,"Goooood crema! Also, the barista remembered my name and my order after my third visit. Nice :)"
Jane on Larkin,"This place is so lovely and delicious! It's order at the register, seat yourself and be served style. Amazing food and super fresh. Also so Instagramable of you're into that sort of thing."
Jane on Larkin,"Super cute spot. A bit hard to find since there isn't a name on the building, but the staff was nice and helpful and the coffee was delicious. Also get a Oreo brownie cookie, you won't regret it!"
Jane on Larkin,"I had meal three times here and became one of my favorite healthy food restourant. At first, I ordered Chia pudding, but I wasn't enjoy the pudding. Because they put lots of seeds but there is little amount of milk. On the other hand, the second time, I ordered soup and sandwich set and chai pudding. The soup was amazing. Usually soups are salted, but this restourant soup wasn't. Also I had tuna sandwitch. It was very good. Today, I got chia pudding again! But this time it was very good!!! The milk was enough to mix all together with seeds and grains. It tastes like super healthy. If you like healthy food or look for vegan restaurant, I recommend this restourant. Good place to enjoy healthy breakfast."
Jane on Larkin,"The bread on the lox and bagel was exceptional. Crunchy, not too dense. Perfection!"
Jane on Larkin,Enormous contamination issues for people with allergies. Served me a salad with wheat croutons alongside gf sandwich. Moronic tbh
Jane on Larkin,"Just stopped by to get some coffee, came here for the first time and it was amazing love the mocha latte, specially the art work of the creame on the top"
Jane on Larkin,Excellent avocado toast and chia pudding stuff with granola. It was a little cramped but there seems to be a relative high turnover.
Jane on Larkin,Great menu with varied items. Great value! The egg sandwich was delicious
Jane on Larkin,"My latte and smoothie bowl were both delicious. Even though it was very busy, my coffee and food were prepared quickly."
Jane on Larkin,"Pocket of sanity in the midst of ""crazy town"": whether you need your daily energetic dose of caffeine or the opposite, relaxing effect of green tea, you'll get it with a nice pastry and OK service."
Jane on Larkin,"Very nice cafe, had a quick breakfast, service was fast and everyone is very friendly. Good food, great coffee. 👌🏼 …"
Jane on Larkin,"BEST BANANA BREAD EVER.. BIG PORTION AND CHEAP. I get one almost everyday, that they're already packing it for me when they see me in line. 😅🤣 …"
Jane on Larkin,WOW. Such a cute bakery / cafe. The staff was super friendly & helped us navigate the menu (we’re visiting from out of state). The coffee was amazing and so was the food. Everything was made fresh. Would definitely find this spot again if we’re ever back in San Fran.
Jane on Larkin,"Cows milk is free. Alt is milk is not. They charge extra for sustainable oat milk. Not an environmentally friendly or vegan management. Otherwise, The staff were angels, very kind. Clean place, original artwork, beautiful ambience."
Jane on Larkin,Nice little bakery cafe with pastries and made to order dishes. The brioche french toast was excellent. Fresh bread and coffee is is also sold at the counter.
Jane on Larkin,"Tasty and healthy great food, hip atmosphere... looking for more places like this around"
Jane on Larkin,I wish Jane would come home with me to Austin. The salads are incredible. The coffee and vibe are also great for an afternoon read.
Jane on Larkin,Jane still makes the best sprinkle cookie hands down!!  Thank you being open during COVID and for opening so early in the day!
Jane on Larkin,Thanks for stopping by! We appreciate the love 🥰
Jane on Larkin,Great brunch spot! Highly recommend the croissant sandwich!
Jane on Larkin,"Super cool hip coffee shop with a beautiful mural, yummy food and friendly staff. Great for a casual brunch and somewhere between a diner and an upscale brunch experience in San Francisco, really couldn't be more of a happy medium!"
Jane on Larkin,The granola was good and the coffee too.
Jane on Larkin,A good small bakery/cafe for a quick on the go breakfast. (Make sure to try their Nutella Cookie).
Jane on Larkin,"Jane's is my neighborhood bakery. I buy bread here when I need something fancy. Their cookies are a favorite treat. I've tried almost everything here, and it's consistently top notch, which justifies the prices that clash with the street scene outside.  There is also a good menu for breakfast and lunch. I've had egg dishes and toasts for breakfast. The eggs are cooked perfectly and the portions are satisfying.  Tables can be hard to come by, and they like you to bus your own meal. Staff are friendly and helpful if you are."
Jane on Larkin,The bake good is great. Service is great.  Over heated the milk for the cappuccino. The surrounding area isn't great.
Jane on Larkin,This place is a gem in SF ! The food is sooo good and their bread is amazing !
Jane on Larkin,"This place wont disappoint you. Amazing food, fresh ingredients, home made everything, including the breads (which are amazing too btw). I'm just in love with this place. They do get a big line though, but totally worth it. I find this location better than the one on Fillmore, and def more spacious. Their dragon fruit bowl, their egg white sandwich and their gluten free banana bread are my favorite items."
Jane on Larkin,Nice Latte. Milk is creamy as it should be.  Service is also friendly. The portion are well served. Recommended
Jane on Larkin,Super yummy peanut butter banana toast
Jane on Larkin,"I got a vegetarian quiche and a chai latte. The chai latte was a little too sweet for me but it was pretty good with oat milk. There was an incident where a homeless person entered the building, but the workers kindly escorted them out."
Jane on Larkin,Delicious coffee. The southwestern Scramble for breakfast was a great plate with greens and scone and eggs and beans delicious breakfast. I went back for lunch and had the chicken mango salad sandwich which was no disappointment at all. Very friendly staff the bread is yummy and so is the coffee
Jane on Larkin,"I loved this place! Very quiet and sweet area in the middle of the city and a very cool and 'hip' place, but they also DO very good not only LOOK good! The coffee is very good and you can hang in there for an hour and just enjoy the morning sun hitting you through the gigantic windows! Pro-tip is the Nutty something bread (I forgot the exact name) with almond butter and jam!!"
Jane on Larkin,"Cute little Cafe in this calm neighborhood. Good food, good for simple and healthy breakfast. Nice and happy service, gentle people at the counter. Fast service, good coffee. The yogurt granola was a good bet. Straight toast with butter will also serve you well."
Jane on Larkin,It's strictly take out now of course but the food is great. If you haven't experienced it by all means make the small effort to locate this hidden treasure you'll be quite glad you did. Staff is very friendly and helpful. This place is like these that you definitely want to see in the coming years after this virus so show them some love and help keep them going.
Jane on Larkin,"Oasis in the tenderloin! This place is awesome. My iced latte was excellent. The drangonfruit bowl was so refreshing and the egg sandwich was BOMB. I also felt the pricing was really reasonable for SF. I want to go back and try lunch, the sandwiches I saw coming out of the kitchen looked so good!"
Jane on Larkin,Good place! Coffee was great and had outdoor seating.
Jane on Larkin,"Very cool cafe. Excellent espresso and dragonfruit smoothie bowl and good music. Knocking off 2 stars for the smoothie and the eggs dish - 2 eggs in it, one way under and the other way over. The green smoothie was super pulpy and acidic. You just expect a place this hip to nail classics. Will be back for the baked goods and coffee though."
Jane on Larkin,Excellent food! French toast is heavenly:)
Jane on Larkin,Bakery is great.  Food ok. The western salad was pretty good. Sandwich disappointing.
Jane on Larkin,Looks pretty rough outside but the food is bomb.
Jane on Larkin,"Great breakfast spot. Super cute, friendly service, good food. Only issue is the neighborhood is a little sketchy, so just be mindful if you are coming from another area"
Jane on Larkin,The staff and atmosphere is friendly and inviting. Their chai latte is delectable (if you prefer a spicy and slightly sweet latte it's perfect). Their iced coffee is delicious (goes great with a splash of almond milk). Their pastry selection is vast with sweet to savory and buttery to spicy. You can watch them prep and make everything right in front of you... definitely need to come back and try their specialty toasts.
Jane on Larkin,"Nice little bakery/coffee shop along the streets of SF. They have a good range of food choices and run their own coffee. However I prefer less acidic espresso as they do run. Nice staff, rather small location."
Jane on Larkin,"It's like people have never tried nice cafe food before coming here. About the best I can say is it's one of the more reasonably priced places around.  The owners need to spend less time on the decor and vibe, and more time working on the food and coffee.  My eggs were cold and rubbery, and the bacon was lacklustre at best. Understandably baking bacon is easy to do en masse, but imparts very little flavour profile. The result is one dimensional thin strips of 'meh'.  Recommend also not correcting pronunciation of patrons coffee orders on borrowed words. There is no correct pronunciation of 'mocha'.  Once you get your food situation in order, you'll have a nice cafe. Cool vibe and actually reasonable prices."
Jane on Larkin,"I live nearby and this used to be my favorite place in the neighborhood. The last time I stopped in to buy my weekly coffee beans there was a cockroach hanging out right on the counter next to the espresso machine. I have not been able to bring myself to go back since. Very sad since I loved their coffee, pastries, bread and brunches but I cannot deal with that level of pest issue."
Jane on Larkin,It's a bit overpriced for what you get. The salads are pretty basic (but large and filling) so I guess they balance each other out. It will get pretty busy during lunch hours so try to come off hours like early afternoon if you want to eat in the restautant. I'm not sure where they get their coffee but it's great.
Jane on Larkin,"A breakfast revelation! Thick & creamy espresso, delicious French Toast, award-winning croissants, and nice staff - what more can you ask for? (In a bit of a rough neighborhood…)"
Jane on Larkin,"So, I'm never in this neighborhood but I was grabbing some donuts at Holmes . The gal there told us about this place. I was soooo impressed! The selection was all up my ally, Organic, smoothies, salads and Avocado Toast!! Real airy space, big tables and cool counter. Yes it's in the loin but a tolerable part. I would come again. I welcome places like this in this part of town. Clean up the loin."
Jane on Larkin,"I go here pretty frequently for my morning fix. Aside from a good brew that rivals bluebottle, the hip little coffee spot offers delicious treats (e.g. cookies, croissants, pound cake) as well as an extensive menu of breakfast/light lunch items.  Get the avocado toast and avoid peak hours!"
Jane on Larkin,"Amazing local joint.  I had the shired eggs and a chai tea latte.  Service is great, and the staff really friendly and warm.  Decor is hip, colorful and clean.  The food is fantastic. Love this place....just tried it on a whim while visiting from New York City!"
Jane on Larkin,Coffee and espresso is so good here. I've tried their crossaints (chocolate) and their delicious. The charcoal latte and tumeric lattes ar also delicious. This location is a terrific location  to get coffee to wait for Brenda's Soul Food. It's a great place to chat and just chill with friends.
Jane on Larkin,"My recommendation is to not order from here on Uber Eats!  The delivery driver, Flo, was very friendly, delivering the food promptly with a smile. No qualms here.  I ordered the Super Healthy Salad with chicken, and the Dragonfruit Smoothie Bowl.  To be honest, I know this place probably can make great food, but my salad was missing the chicken (tasting incredibly bland), and the smoothie bowl was more of a gelatinous soup, lacking much of the toppings.  Overall, I was pretty unimpressed, since the meal came to a whopping $30. So much for treat yo self!"
Jane on Larkin,"Jane on Larkin is a neighborhood treasure in the polk gulch/tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco.  While they were always awesome pre-pandemic, Jane has been putting out the same delightful and modestly-priced food and coffee program throughout the pandemic.  They also have a great selection of well-designed and solid mugs, beautifully roasted coffees, and crazy yummy bakery goods! Not to mention, everybody who offers counter service is friendly, attentive, and kind - you can feel the positive vibes throughout.  Go to Jane!"
Jane on Larkin,"I got the avocado toast. Was a bit apprehensive about paying $9 for toast, but don't be fooled. It's not just toast. It's a nice piece of toasted homemade bread with crushed avocado, pickled onions and a poached egg on top. It was seasoned so well and I was very full after. Parking is a bit of a challenge though..."
Jane on Larkin,"Nice cafe with counter service, baked goods and a bustling atmosphere. The oatcake I ordered was filling and we'll balanced, the coffee was good but not amazing. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area."
Jane on Larkin,"Seemed fine to me. Kinda crummy neighborhood, but close to New Century (though Jane is only open early). Coffee was maybe $.50 more expensive than needed. Quiche was tasty. I think most people go here for the pastries but I'm not a pastries person."
Jane on Larkin,"Had the perfect breakfast here, I loved it."
Jane on Larkin,"Who knew Jane had a sister cafe! I stumbled across this cafe whilst walking in the city and was pleasantly surprised. Jane on Larkin is one of the few cafes in this city that sell fresh sourdough bread. From the plain white to olive sourdough, you can't really go wrong! This cafe has a calm feeling to it. Perhaps it's the staff combined with the space, high ceilings and plenty of room between tables."
Jane on Larkin,Ordered my usual Asian chicken salad. What arrived was awful. The chicken was soaked with oil and turned into a cheese. We sent it back. The new salads were almost as bad. They are definitely using a processed chicken meat that has fake grill marks. We left the new salads barely touched. Never to return.
Jane on Larkin,"A great coffee shop right on the border of the Tenderloin, Jane has some great pastries and Stumptown coffee, straight from Oregon. I'm a fan of the bottled ice coffee, but it's a bit pricey. The place looks great on the inside and is a perfect place to do some writing or reading."
Jane on Larkin,"Great spot, very delicious food. Always busy so it's tough to get a table, though! My #1 selling point is that they have cold brew coffee on tap and it is divine!"
Jane on Larkin,"Good quality food at a semi reasonable price for SF. Parking can be tricky, and the locale is not kid friendly."
Jane on Larkin,Ordered toast...this is bread. How do you screw up toast? The bacon seems not to be pork...or food for people.
Jane on Larkin,"Croissant incredible, latte mediocre. Barista could use some training (I’m a barista). Also seemed like a lot of staff just stood around."
Jane on Larkin,Berry & Creme Cheese Brioche is sold out by 8:30am right now so I feel lucky to accidentally discover it for the first time 10 min early on my walk by! haha it’s SO worth the indulgence
Jane on Larkin,The food is good! But beware of the weirdo outside of the cafe!! I saw he grabbed the food of another lady. I know it’s not related to the cafe but it should probably do something about it. The whole experience was scary!
Jane on Larkin,"Hi Li, Thank you for the comments. We are aware of the situation and have called the police and outreach groups many times. We ask him often to leave but are a little left alone by SF to deal with these issues. We would be happy to offer you a gift card to visit again and hopefully have a better experience. Thank you again."
Jane on Larkin,One of the better Chai's in S.F.  Delicious baked breads and baked goods.  All the food I've ordered here is good.  Service is good.  I'm always satisfied with what they offer.  Some dishes are a little overpriced.
Jane on Larkin,Tasty stop for a sandwich and iced matcha.  The matcha is premixed but just slightly sweet which I appreciated. There is no wifi but ample natural light seating. Really enjoyed their mango chicken salad sandwich on toasted sourdough.
Jane on Larkin,Absolutely pathetic! It would have taken 10 more seconds to actually get the toppings on the bread. One little blob of mustard. Will never return.
Jane on Larkin,"Spend 6 days in SF. Breakfast at Jane's on larkin 4 days. Very nice scramble egg sandwich, Good coffee and friendly service. Egg bacon and french toast is sadly only on weekends Great place in rough neighbourhood."
Jane on Larkin,A lovely bakery/eatery in a not so nice area.
Jane on Larkin,"The Egg Whites Sandwich is excellent. Toasted sourdough, spinach,  provolone, avocado, sriracha, scrambled egg whites. Check out the art gallery and Robert Mizer foundation across the street if you appreciate Weirdness©️."
Jane on Larkin,"Awful customer service. I ordered a pour over and a espresso shot. My order was first in line, they skip my order and prepare 4 other orders first. I ask barista about my order he says it takes five minutes. Theres a bunch of other workers standing their while one guy does all coffee orders, it looked unorganized + scattered, not a great combo. Was hoping to give them a shot, but couldn't bare to wait so long for an espresso shot, especially when I should have been the first person to be accounted for. Luckily San Francisco is FULL of coffee shops, who produce espresso shots on the spot when they're ordered."
Jane on Larkin,This is a no brainer-good coffee and quick healthy tasty eats. Use to frequent Jane on the regular when I was closer to the loin. highly recommended 👌
Jane on Larkin,"Odd set-up - order your meal and then hope that a table emerges. In a party of four, this was not achieved and we were split between two tables. Attempted to order my regular weekend coffee of a Vienna and the person behind the counter was bewildered by the concept of cream. My replacement order  - a long macchiato - was neither long nor what I'd consider to be a macchitao.  The food itself was not great, with the eggs and hollandaise poorly done. For a place with quite good reviews on several websites, I could not help but feel disappointed by the whole experience."
Jane on Larkin,# Bathroom code. 9925. #   This place  Ain't Bad at all! super close to my normal hangout so I tend to hang here tunz.. They are super friendly to their regulars and the coffee is very good and consistent  Best I found in the TL so far. :P
Jane on Larkin,"Soild breakfast and lunch options. I really enjoy their scrambled egg sandwich, club sandwich, and the chia pudding. The coffee is superb. They are a little pricey, but the quality of the food is excellent."
Jane on Larkin,"AMAZING baked goods, delicious brunch menu, great coffee, and even better people watching. Gets crowded on the weekends, so might be hard to find a seat during busy times. Try the bread!"
Jane on Larkin,Great americano and breakfast sandwich with tomato chutney. They have quite a variety of fresh pasties and different bfast items. Will be back!
Jane on Larkin,"Delicious! Can get busy w a line here. Everything is great from hot dishes, baked goods, takeaway treats, coffee. Jane bread often served at local restaurants. No wifi"
Jane on Larkin,"I just posted a picture of the size of the croissant they sell there , they are stollen money from us!! Shame on you $5 for a bite !!?? Last time eating your scam !!😠😠😡😡 …"
Jane on Larkin,"This is a nice yuppie addition to the Tendernob, though the contrast between the homeless guys hanging out in front of the Chinese church a half block away the the sleekness of Jane can be a bit jarring. The pastries are delicious and baked on the premises and the quiche is tasty with a nice flakey crust. It's not cheap, but not much is in San Francisco."
Jane on Larkin,"Solid coffee and a delicious sausage biscuit.  The latte was made well, but the seating and the food pushed the rating to 5 stars for me. Noms."
Jane on Larkin,"Ordered a coffee and received great service which was kind and courteous but the coffee was a bit expensive for it's quality. I didn't receive a ""yo"" from the attendant but this place is in fact right on the edge of a really bad neighborhood but that doesn't effect your visit inside just drop the cost of the coffee and we'll be cool !!"
Jane on Larkin,"I love this place! They have a large menu with very appetizing choices, lots of great coffee selections, and a lovely interior. Everything about this place is amazing - large windows, lots of seating, and friendly staff."
Jane on Larkin,"Very well lit, well designed, yet quaint.  Their breakfast is incredible from the southwest scramble to the sausage biscuit.  Pair with a latté and get your day off to a great start."
Jane on Larkin,"A great little coffee shop, with a bakery in the back. I love the fresh cinnamon rolls and the stumptown coffee! Very clean, very trendy, and very much in the tenderloin. Worth it."
Jane on Larkin,not bad
Jane on Larkin,"Best brunch place in the area. The eggs are cooked to perfection in every dish, and the coffee beats almost all of the chains, national and local."
Jane on Larkin,"I was underwhelmed by the menu, but I love doing a touch of shopping here. I picked up a perfect baguette and bag of whole beans. I think this will become my staple for those items."
Jane on Larkin,Good food. Noisy environment.
Jane on Larkin,"Great place for breakfast, popular with the locals. Good coffee, home made pastries and bread and also warm dishes. Would recommend!"
Jane on Larkin,"Nitro coffee!! It is the most caffeinated kind of coffee you can get, and it's DELICIOUS! Jane also has amazing food awesome artisanal bread you can buy by the loaf! No wifi, but it's ok to bring your own."
Jane on Larkin,"Okay, I am not one to leave a negative review. I prefer to focus on the good, but I am not happy about how Jane’s handled an incident yesterday.  The incident: My boyfriend and I stopped by to buy some coffee. As soon as we entered, a cute little dog started barking at us. Not a problem! What was was a problem is the dog owner said something along the lines of “oh (the dog) doesn’t speak Mexican haha...oh I mean Spanish haha” to his friend about us. Obviously it was loud enough for us to hear.  I slowly reacted but I did repeat what he said loud enough for his friends to hear me. We were all in line with one person in between us. For some reason, I didn’t have the energy to argue or fight, and I asked my boyfriend not to start anything either. I feel that other people heard him and none of them cared. We would be the irrational loud brown people!  After his friends heard me repeat what their friend said, they looked embarrassed, but said nothing. The man realized I had a cellphone and kept his back toward me for a while. I waited, he turned and I took a photo. Nauseated at the incident, we left without buying coffee. We planned on watching the second half of the last game of the World Cup at Civic Center anyway! After the game finished, my boyfriend could tell I was still upset so we walked back to Jane’s to talk to someone. It wasn’t their fault after all, but I just needed to be heard.  Their response: We approached a young lady working the counter. She was extremely apologetic and so was another guy behind the counter. I could tell they sympathized, so one of them went to tell the manager.  We waited for a bit, and after a few minutes, the guy we talked to earlier approached us. He reluctantly (not in a negative way but in I don’t want to say this script) asked us if we wanted a free pastry while we waited. (Umm no) Almost immediately and without walking away, he told us the manager couldn’t come out, but that they knew who the man was. They asked us to speak up next time. They assured us that they would take care of it, and since I tend to avoid confrontation, I said thank you and we left.  After: My boyfriend and I talked. We felt that the fact the manager didn’t care to come out, and that they thought we wanted free pastries means that we have so much doubt they’ll say anything to that man. It’s our word against his. They didn’t ask for our contact info in order to follow up or anything.  - Yes, it wasn’t Jane’s fault the incident happened.  - Yes, we didn’t speak up during the incident, but sometimes it’s difficult to react “correctly” every time an incident like this happens. It’s not the first time, and it won’t be the last time we encounter a person with a prejudice.  - Yes, the employees up front were great, and they did what they could after they learned of what happened. They were limited by what they could do though.  - No, we don’t want free pastries!  To the manager, we’re disappointed in your reaction. We’ve lived in the neighborhood for the past decade, decade and a half. Please care about all of us."
Jane on Larkin,"Great Service, Quality Fresh Food... Good Coffee...Their own bakery breads are wonderful. I've brought breads to meetings and people always ask me about where I bought them"
Jane on Larkin,One of the best croissant in SF but the slowest and unprofessional service. Waited over 15 min for a coffee and the place is empty. no apologize from the waiter.
Jane on Larkin,"Coffe is fine, but when I asked if i can have the wifi password. The waitress said we have no wifi here. But I saw at least 5 people were using wifi at this place. Am I the only person do not have my own wifi device? I am so curious!"
Jane on Larkin,This is the best coffee shop in the neighborhood.  Everyone that works there is very kind and unique.  Don’t forget to eat something!
Jane on Larkin,Thank you for your support and kind words!
Jane on Larkin,"Their coffee is great. Their brunch is even better. Get the avocado mash, baked eggs, sausage sandwich or scramble!"
Jane on Larkin,"Great coffee and pastries. As an out of town visitor, a friend recommended that I come here, and I agree with other reviews that the staff do recognize and treat their regulars nicely."
Jane on Larkin,"Killer cookies, great bread loaf (though expensive). You'd hope the staff would enjoy themselves a bit more. It generally feels like you're imposing a little bit too much on their privacy."
Jane on Larkin,"Absolutely blown away by their french toast, but I was honestly a little disappointed by their espresso, I feel like there was too many powerful flavors going on which prevented any of the flavors from being the star."
Jane on Larkin,Jane is a great bakery with such great laminated pastries. Although the line was long and could have been shorter with perhaps another cashier to help.
Jane on Larkin,Love this spot.  Delish coffee and the avo smash vegan/gluten free style was bombers. Highly recommended all around.  Sweet staff too! 🙏 …

Jane on Larkin,"Lovely place, great coffee and granola! Friendly staff - slightly scary neighbourhood but fine once you get there."

Jane on Larkin,"it is clean, staffed by young trendy people. great quality foods. reasonable  prices. wonderful place to meet, eat & get back to work quickly."

Jane on Larkin,"Jane in general is a great bakery and tasty place and this one is not an exlusion, however the neighborhood is not very pleasant though."
Jane on Larkin,French bakery items in this neighborhood? Finally a great café for locals...not the same traps that sell Costco warehouse muffins to tourists.
Jane on Larkin,Thanks Jane for taking a bet on the neighborhood! Good latte. Fresh baguettes. Prices are maybe a bit high for the food itself.
Jane on Larkin,"Excellent coffee, pastries and breakfast in a great atmosphere."
Jane on Larkin,The Peruvian chicken bowl had an amazing taste and their coffee (cappuccino) is really great!

Jane on Larkin,"It is possibly my happy place in San Francisco where I love the coffee, the food and the prices. I think it's cheap and good. They have toasts, smoothie bowls, chia, and other stronger dishes, including soups. They also have a good variety of sweet breads and you can buy bread to go. Yes, perhaps the neighborhood is very ugly but the site is worth it."
Jane on Larkin,"The neighborhood is known to be dangerous, but in reality there are many good households. This latte is delicious. neighborhood restaurant"
Jane on Larkin,"Chai is excellent, avocado toast delicious, excellent ambiance. Good attention. Definitely will come again. Chai is excellent, avocado toast delicious, great atmosphere. Good attention. I definitely come back again."

Jane on Larkin,"Four stars because unfortunately I can't stay longer to try all the variety they have. But everything looks great and you see how they make it right there. The price is a little higher than in other places, but within the price of San Francisco. It's a very good idea if you're around."
Jane on Larkin,Very tasty breakfast. With - you'll be amazed - really crispy smoked bread on offer.
Jane on Larkin,delicious! The environment is great!
Jane on Larkin,"A big surprise on the Tendernob. In addition to making excellent coffee, their breads and pastries are some of the best in the city. The crumb of each toast looks like a fractal, pure craftsmanship. The toasts are very good, especially the avocado one. The place is simple and orderly. They attend quickly, although it costs them too much to smile."
Jane on Larkin,"A great experience! We had the impression of participating in the life of the people of the place. Few tourists when we went there. Excellent dishes. Few places to sit. In high season, it is easy to imagine the wait."
Jane on Larkin,"Excellent breakfast. The surroundings, however, are not the best. Sadly, many people are seen living on the streets. The restaurant hall is small and there is a long queue at peak times..."
