The Coffee Movement,Sometimes it's not just about the coffee. I had a hot chocolate and it was delicious! Very grown up and sophisticated taste. The owner Brian was delightful which added to the charm! He cattered our office and was super fantastic! Talk to him about his custom coffee cart he made which was some neat engineering. 😀
The Coffee Movement,"We stopped by for a coffee in the afternoon. We ordered a macchiato, two ice coffees with different beans, and a cappucino. The interior is very spartan, but nice. The coffee menu is displayed by the counter. There are a few seats inside, and you can also stand and sit outside the cafe.  The staff was not very friendly and we were told to squeeze into a corner by the counter to order, so as to not block the entrance… the place was empty… In general, the person who took the orders was behaving as if he was running a boot camp, not a cafe. Very odd experience.  The coffees were all mediocre. The beans were extremely bitter, almost sour, to the point that not even adding oat milk or regular milk would help. We ordered four different coffees, and none of us finished their coffee - it was simply too sour.  We enjoy trying new cafes wherever we travel, in fact it’s a quest to find the perfect coffee. This was a strange experience, and with the many good cafes in SF, we certainly won‘t come back to this Coffee Movement.  Ambience: 3/5 Staff: 1/5 Coffee: 2/5 Price/quality: 2/5 (average price, poor quality)"
The Coffee Movement,"Really high quality coffee that blows me away every time. A bit of a random area for a third wave coffee shop, but a huge hit for sure. It can be fun to stand outside and watch the trolleys go by with a drink! It has recently been spotlighted in some viral tiktoks so expect lines these days."
The Coffee Movement,"Coffee Movement has grown to become my favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. Coming here has become a weekly ritual during which I treat myself by slowing down to appreciate a nice cup of coffee. The seasonal drinks are always so delicious and carefully crafted, and the Oat Milk Mocha with half the choc ganache has been my go-to. The staff is kind and very chill. I love this place and highly recommend!"
The Coffee Movement,"I've heard from multiple sources that the Coffee Movement is the best coffee place in San Francisco  I'm inclined to agree  The coffee itself is great. So is the staff. They've always been kind, patient with my questions, and you can tell they are passionate about doing things right. The pasties are good (I think they get them from the same place Réveille gets theirs from). I've latched onto the (vegan) mixed berry muffin.  It can get crowded fast so I tend to go right when they open  You can see the Transamerica Pyramid and Bay Bridge from there. It's on a couple of cable car lines. So it's particularly San Francisco-y.  They have for here glasses and dishes  They have me excited to try their single origin coffees next times I go. Without any sort of upselling on their part, which I appreciate.  Go!"
The Coffee Movement,"Something of a coffee mecca, was extremely impressed with the quality and taste of the brewed coffee and espresso I received.  Would highly recommend to any third wave coffee enthusiast and/or weird coffee person™.  Minimum seating (plan on consuming your beverages outside) and the staff seemed a bit stiff (for reference, my visits were in April/May 2022) - but they do what they do very well.  Don't be surprised by a line out the door."
The Coffee Movement,Great small coffee shop that serves excellent crafted cappuccinos and lattes. The coffee had a wonderful taste with a hint of sweetness and earthiness at the end. The start to finish process showcases the Baristas amazing level of care and attention to detail.
The Coffee Movement,Artisanal coffee shop with dedication to their craft.  Very tasty espresso pour (Bolivia and Colombia) and my Costa Rica coffee was well crafted too.  I found them completely by accident
The Coffee Movement,"Just amazing, there is a reason there is a (small) queue out the front of this super clean espresso temple. Been in SF all week and been drinking brewed or pour over, this was special!! Great work team!!"
The Coffee Movement,"Awesome place! Bryan and all the staff is great, best coffee and croissants! Really come check them out as the general ambient here is awesome, the coffee they serve is top notch and just the human quality is for sure one of the best in town!"
The Coffee Movement,"Hands down the best espresso I got in the US so far. Good spot, right next to the cable car line Powell & Hyde. The place is nice and clean  and there are only spots outside available, but thats usually fine.  View down Washington Street all the way to Oakland bridge."
The Coffee Movement,"Cute little coffee shop that knows its crafts. Do expect a long line during weekend as they only allow two people in each time. Besides that, the coffee is amazing and I’d say worth the wait.  They also provided some outdoor seatings and water bowl for the 4 legged friends :)"
The Coffee Movement,"It seems like this is one of the nicest coffee shops in San Francisco. Great espresso, cappucino with dusted dark chocolate was sensational. I recommend you enjoying it there and they will make it in a real coffee cup. Enjoy the movement! It matters.."
The Coffee Movement,"Cute little place for great coffee!  This is a small place and only two people are allowed in at a time. Hence, during weekend you will see a long line outside the store. Service is quick, so wait is not long. However, be prepared to wait for 10-15 mins in line during weekends.  The interior of the store is aesthetically pleasing with a minimalistic design. Staff are warm and friendly and the place is impeccable.  There are some spots to sit down on the sidewalk to enjoy your coffee. When it comes to coffee, I tried their cocoa cappuccino, it’s amazing. It has balanced flavor with subtle hints of cocoa and good level of creaminess.  Definitely a place to visit for coffee lovers!"
The Coffee Movement,"Nice to find an espresso tonic on the menu (sadly it wasn’t as smooth as I usually find them), but the staff really needs to relax a bit. I found the process of waiting, ordering and paying very awkward and at one point uncomfortable as the staff was constantly barking around orders on where you should stand or not stand. There was only 1 other person in the shop, the rest had to wait outside. So there was plenty space. When I tried to walk over to the merch (I wanted to buy a tee) I was told to stay in my place. Again, just one other person inside so plenty of space to move around. I ended up not buying the tee because I didn’t find an opportunity to actually go and look at sizes, and I was completely put off by the staff. If you have a certain ‘flow’, communicate it with the customers on a sign so they know what you expect them to do. I left the store feeling like the staff was annoyed by my presence, and from how I saw them treat other customers I am sure they felt something similar. Reading other reviews I see it’s not just my experience and I think it’s time the staff switches to decaf so they don’t act so nervous all the time."
The Coffee Movement,"I love the espresso flight option here, it’s a great way to experience their coffee! Also the shop is located in a very unique location where you can enjoy your coffee and watch the cable car go by 🌉 …"
The Coffee Movement,"Highly recommend this place for great coffee and something a little unique in the coffee scene. There are coffees from several roasters on offer - local, national and international - to suit a range of tastes. All of the offerings are very well done. Choose between an espresso-based flight (one coffee 3 ways), a brewed flight (3 different brewed coffees), and several batch-brew, pour-over or milk-based options. This Washington location is small compared with the other SF location, so you'll need to loiter at the stand-up tables outside to drink your coffee. Beans from various roasters (such as Onyx and Manhattan Coffee Roasters) and other coffee paraphernalia for sale too."
The Coffee Movement,the coffee movement is the cutest lil coffee shop! there isn't much room inside but there's an outdoor standing area in front of the store. i went a lil before noon and it wasn't too busy!  i got the orange cream latte which was a seasonal drink and i wasn't too impressed tbh :( i couldn't really taste the orange cream flavor. points for the cute and simple design of the shop tho! tbh it's a great place to grab n go so id probably visit their second location and try a diff drink!  what i got: - orange cream latte  ig: @whatsviveating
The Coffee Movement,"This neat little slice of heaven wasn't even on my radar, none of the ""coffee 'blogs'"" even mentioned it on google but the kind folks at saint frank sent me their way and I was not disappointed in any way. They serve great espresso, which is well prepared and on par with other specialty shops, but what really makes them stand out are the coffee creations they serve. My wife ordered a coffee cream soda and it's indescribable. The bliss I experienced while sipping on this delight is really beyond my words. It's not too sweet, nothing overpowering, just an amalgamation of all  flavors you could want to experience simultaneously. Do yourself a favor and pay them a visit, it might change you forever."
The Coffee Movement,"This cute little coffeeshop is close to perfection. Classis 3rd wave coffee, right sized cortado, flat white. Amazing coffee blends and taste selection! Ive been here during my stay 5 times, and will go back without any hesitation. Service is top notch, the baristas put all their love into their craft. Masterclass of how you make proper coffee. Only pastries are served. Merch and coffee beans are offered. No bathroom option."
The Coffee Movement,"Not very good coffee. As an Aussie traveller, I was excited when I was told about this place having great, Aussie-style coffees. It also had good reviews and a long line outside so expectations were fairly high but it was definitely a let down. The staff were nice (no Aussies), atmosphere was nice although they wouldn't let us stay inside at the standing bar even though it was raining, but the coffee was mostly just steamed milk. Super milky, little coffee. :( Unfortunately, pretty overrated."
The Coffee Movement,ok dokie.
The Coffee Movement,"Learned about Coffee Movement from the U.S. Coffee Championships, and they did not disappoint! The seasonal creation, which as the time of this visit in July 2022 was an orange cream latte, was amazing - it tasted like a creamsicle melted in your coffee, but in a good way. The flight (one coffee prepared in three different ways) allows you to taste how different one type of beans can taste in different settings. Definitely a gem :)"
The Coffee Movement,"Located in a quiet, residential street, this small coffee spot has one of the best coffee in the city. They have few pastry options as well. There is no seating option indoors but you can take your coffee and pastry and sit on the bench outside. I ordered the Cocoa cappuccino which was delicious and highly recommend it."
The Coffee Movement,I enjoyed the Cafe au lai made with a distinct chocolate flavor.  Staff is friendly and welcoming.  I will try their other coffee flavors as well.
The Coffee Movement,Amazing!!! Offers three types of roasts. Very modern and jucy taste
The Coffee Movement,"This is a heaven for coffee lovers.  I tried the tasting flight and is a great experience  to try coffee in different way.  The environment is warm and minimal and the service is fast and nice.  For coffee lover like me, definitely I will came back."
The Coffee Movement,Wonderfully aesthetic. Well thought out. Terrific coffee and lattes.  You order from one end and pay at the register and they have oat milk for a milk sub. You order for there but take it outside and enjoy on their vw outdoor set up or take it go.
The Coffee Movement,This is such a quaint little coffee shop tucked away in a nice little place. The staff were super friendly and my latte tasted so fresh and perfectly crafted. Recommend!
The Coffee Movement,Super delicious but sad there’s not real seating / get ready for a line.
The Coffee Movement,"If you’re a coffee connoisseur you’ll know. These coffees are expertly made by artists in their craft. Coffee so smooth, so well balanced it practically drinks itself! Hole in the wall coffee shop only the pros go to! Strong coffee too. Consistently great (whereas other shops you may not always get the same quality, milk frothing etc., acidity). They pay attention to every detail every time."
The Coffee Movement,Amazing coffee with a great view! Very friendly staff! Their espresso was so delicious. The cafe serves many types of beans including one of my favorite local roastery: St Frank’s.  What a special gem in Chinatown!
The Coffee Movement,"I wasn't planning on stopping by here during my trip to SF, but there was a line going out the door and piqued my curiosity. They definitely have good coffee - and the interior is super minimalist (every millenial's favorite).  But they definitely fell short on the customer service side for me.  They should treat all customers equally. For me, they didn't really take the time to explain the menu / types of coffee they offered. Nor did they ask if I was planning on drinking the coffee at the cafe or wanting it to-go. For the next customer, they provided a lot of context of the coffee as well as asked if they wanted to dine in / wanted the coffee to-go.  Overall, the coffee was a 5/5 but service was more like a 2/5, hence the 3/5 review."
The Coffee Movement,"The beans they sell are good, but that’s more of the roasters and less about the cafe. Their brewing wasnt very good thiugh - the cappuccino tastes extremely bitter (i think they brewed with too high temperature water for the beans and adjust primarily for sugary drinks). The line concept is also convoluted, inefficient, and allows the barista to be mean to people randomly. I noticed that they were extremely mean to some people and nice to others. Pass"
The Coffee Movement,"I’ve been to many coffee places that are world renowned and with good baristas and coffees (Sey, Passage, La Cabra etc). This place pretends to be one of the greats, but is overrated since the coffee was not so good..  The line is long and inefficient, the ordering process is confusing for no reason (and almost neurotic. Why not let customers just see the menu?), the drinks are not very good since it seems to be tuned for sugary milk concoctions (coffee was over roasted in a simple latte). And worst of all, the barista is condescending and mean! There were three people working but they made such a big mess of a process that they were slower and quality control was worse than multiple two-person-only shops serving 10x more customers in Manhattan or Brooklyn or Amsterdam I’ve been to. Maybe SF just has a not very inspiring coffee scene in general if this is considered good….  Definitely skip"
The Coffee Movement,Ah dude this is a hidden gem in SF! I tried the orange cream iced latte and I'm so hooked! I can't wait to try this place again and enjoy all the delicious caffeinated goodness they have to offer. The staff is super friendly and they're such pros at making the coffee. Definitely recommend everything and anything they make. Go go go!
The Coffee Movement,"Excellent coffee. I’d recommend trying the tasting flight- you can either order 3 different roasts/blends served black, or 1 type of coffee served 3 different ways (black, espresso and espresso with milk). Flights are a great way to learn about your personal preferences when it comes to coffee!  Parking is hard to find in this area, so I’d recommend taking public transportation or walking over."
The Coffee Movement,"The interior design from inside is really nice and simple. Also, the staff is more than friendly. It is one of the cleanest places. The place does not have a place to set; however, it is worth going there for their coffee (I am not an expert on test coffee, but that one is one of the best). I took almond croissant, just take it without thinking !"
The Coffee Movement,Excellent coffee! Seasonal syrup now is ginger spice (what makes ginger bread cookies) goes really well with my latte! My friend decided to try espresso tonic and he really likes it! Very friendly staffs too!
The Coffee Movement,Can I say it’s the best coffee in SF? I dunno. I don’t think we have a process. If we do lemme know. Until then - this is the best coffee in SF.
The Coffee Movement,"This is quite possibly one of the best coffee shops around. Super clean and beautiful space. Cosy music. Innovative cocoa cappuccino. Fair prices. Great service.  Only request is to charge the same prices for dairy and non dairy options. However, super awesome that server only charged non dairy premium for one coffee.  Will definitely return."
The Coffee Movement,"I was so excited to make the trip to check this place out, and the trek was so worth it. Really warm and friendly baristas. The interior was simple and clean. Coffee was stellar.  I ordered a Lavender Oat Latte and a Cocoa Cappuccino. I highly recommend both of those. Try their coffee sampler as well!  Enjoy! ☺️  Their shelves are stocked with beautifully curated tchotchkes and artisanal setups for brewing at home and what not. They also carry Onyx Coffee Lab Whole Beans! 🤗😍"
The Coffee Movement,The cocoa cappuccino is okay. Nothing special and nothing worth the 15 minutes wait outside. However the place and staff are very pretentious. You have to wait outside until they call you in and only one person can be inside at a time. Once you go in you have to go to the right to order and then apparently wait until that person tells you literally to go two steps to the left to the person who frots the milk. Then you wait for the second person to tell you to gi to the third another three steps  to the left to pay...
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee Great options Great customer service The coffee shop is a little small but it is the coffee we’re focusing on. Both their ice and hot drip coffee are fantastic. Grab a croissant if you have time!
The Coffee Movement,Just a brilliant coffee shop. The rating lived up to the height. Excellent taste. Reasonably priced.
The Coffee Movement,I tried the seasonal latte and it was incredible! Favorite coffee I have had on my road trip across California!
The Coffee Movement,"Charming space & the friendliest baristas around! Enjoyed a nice little chat while we ordered, got our drinks & paid. Prices are really good compared to other hipster coffee places ($4 for chocolate cappuccino/latte, $0.50 for alt milks). They also have a couple of teas from Song Tea in SF. My personal croissant meter: 17/20 (crispy, shattery, but a little dry and butter lacked flavor)"
The Coffee Movement,"There was this old coffee shop in SF called contraband coffee. For a while it was my favorite microbrewery as their single origin Ethiopian had this amazing fruity flavor. Unfortunately, it closed down during Covid.  I’ve been searching for something similar, and the onyx (Ethiopian) is the closest I’ve found, and I actually prefer it. I would highly recommend. The prices are p solid as well.  They also offer a sampler for $5-$7 to help ppl figure out which coffee they like. I highly appreciate this, and would recommend doing it!"
The Coffee Movement,Delicious and well made coffee.  Very close to hotel Intercontinental Mark Hopkins and Chinatown.  Great pastries. I loved the Croissant.
The Coffee Movement,Best coffee we had in SF so far. Closest to Melbourne coffee and they do piccolo as well. Expecting a long wait during weekends. And aslo dont stand right infront of the door while queuing as i got told off by one of the staff.
The Coffee Movement,This place and each and every concoction is a must-have experience. They switch out some menu items with each season so try to come often. Staff is great and easy to talk to. The whole venue has all of the class you'd want and none of the snobbery you wouldn't. The place is also very tiny and parking is terrible but it won't take away from the amazing places you'll go with the Coffee Movement.
The Coffee Movement,"Neat little coffee shop with quality daily caffeine fix. Seating is limited to counter space if you get a chance otherwise always great to get your cup on the way. You can use the beige VW pick up truck in front the shop as a counter as well, thats cool."
The Coffee Movement,"Excellent baristas, super friendly and cozy feeling. The shop sells cute and artistic swag. The drinks are good and the pastry quite tasty. Definitely worth checking it out if you’re in the neighborhood. A lot of locals at this shop."
The Coffee Movement,Very fun experience with the flights ❤️ Flight option #1 Three different roasts. Flight option #2  One roast prepared in three ways.
The Coffee Movement,Quality coffee everytime! ☕  Staff are friendly and offers good suggestions. The line may seem long but moves fast.  This cafe does consistently well and hits the spot for a quick caffeine fix. Drinking and reading the news by their vintage van is a nice touch. 🚐
The Coffee Movement,"Espresso tonic is something new/special in this tiny little store. However, wished the pastries could be microwaved to hot before it get served.  Overall good coffee experience here."
The Coffee Movement,"My son and I ate a quick snack with our lattes. The pastries were delicious  and moist,  my chai latte was like being back at my uni cafe in India, it was lovely!"
The Coffee Movement,"Honestly never been to a better coffee shop. So lovely, small space and amazing “piccolo”. It is full of charm and integrity. Make a trip. It is well worth it."
The Coffee Movement,"Delicious coffee, meticulously made. Skip the pastries (they were stale at 8:00am)."
The Coffee Movement,"Very nice shop-keepers, delicious drinks and a cute little place overall. We found it on accident but given how people were queuing for the drinks even tho there was no touristy-spot nearby, I feel like it speaks for itself on how worth it the experience is. I recommend and would love to come back sometime."
The Coffee Movement,Their regular latte and vanilla lavender latte are both absolutely delicious!
The Coffee Movement,"I will start with the humbleness, humanity, professionalism and respect  I was shown at this place, which warmed my heart, all very much appreciated values that should be the backbone of all those who have passion or want to work in this field, but sadly ( unless I am missing those few positive exceptions like the gentlemen I had the pleasure of meeting at the Coffee Movement, who treat customers with exceptional manners, kindness, patience and serve coffees with dedication and honesty-including reasonable prices) are lacking at other coffee shops in the city ‘who charge an arm and a leg’ for a poorly made coffee, served with arrogance and in a post-apocalyptic creepy filthy environment. In case someone is confused, no, filth isn’t cool or hip, it is simply a sign of laziness, disrespect for yourself as well as those who invest in your business. I will happily have my coffee at this place daily in hope that the city wakes up and does something to help those that deserve to get something back for the goodness they pour in, by not being limited with outrageous rent requests and other imposed limitations on the path of their positive mission-making people happy and getting a fair reward on the way! They certainly made my day and I hope nothing ever forces them to change!☺️  ✨💫 🤍🙏🏻🌷🦋"
The Coffee Movement,Loved the orange cream latte! It has a subtle sweetness with a scent of orange zest. This place is a gem and will definitely visit again when I am in the neighborhood.  Updating again after a year and I always visit this place when I’m in the neighborhood. Orange cream latte is the best out of all the seasonal drinks; I really wish they make it into an all-time available menu!
The Coffee Movement,"I think this is my new favorite coffee shop. The prices are so reasonable, and the coffee is always so good.  One coffee three ways was amazing to see the contrast between all. Amazing concept 😍"
The Coffee Movement,"I would give this great little place more stars if I could. Truly the best quality espresso style coffee in the entire city. The owner Bryan is super friendly and clearly cares deeply about the craft of making great coffee. The barista was lovely too! Only a couple of outdoor benches so this is a place to drink some great coffee and chat, not camp with a laptop."
The Coffee Movement,Exactly what we were looking for in a SF coffee shop that takes itself seriously. Got the coffee flight. Recommend it for visitors to SF as there are good views in the neighborhood and it’s close to the cable car museum.
The Coffee Movement,Chill place to grab a quick coffee. Weird and convoluted line and ordering rule. Taste was okay.
The Coffee Movement,Exceptional coffee spot. Nothing less. You’ll know you’re in the right place when you see the customized VW Bus and the line of people waiting. Gotta love they provide water outside for your furry friends.
The Coffee Movement,Hands down the best cappuccino in all of San Francisco
The Coffee Movement,"You see wooden interior with plants, and you know this is a third-wave coffee house. They sell beans and offer Saint Frank coffees which for some reason tasted a bit bitter compared to when I had it in Saint Frank. Strange!"
The Coffee Movement,"The staff were very courteous. I was disappointed the chai latte is limited to fall and winter, but I'll hope to stop back later this year and check it out."
The Coffee Movement,"Great coffee and nice special flavours, best coffee I’ve had in a while and definitely worth a detour!!"
The Coffee Movement,Incredibly delicious drinks! The coffee flight is such a fun experience and the people are friendly and very knowledgeable
The Coffee Movement,"European style coffee shop with stand-and-chat community atmosphere, very friendly staff, and amazing [third wave] coffee. Really reasonable prices ($3.50 cappuccino).  Tip well, this place deserves it!"
The Coffee Movement,Had a really great shot of their single original from black and white roasters.  3/5 because the entire time I was there I felt like they didn't actually want me there. The experience was borderline uncomfortable. I've been to a lot of cafes and it's rare that the baristas are so dismissive and completely unwilling to engage in conversation about coffee.  I'd rather just make espresso at home at that point. If I'm coming to the cafe it's for the cafe experience not to be treated poorly.
The Coffee Movement,"Hands-down my favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. They have it all: The best selection of coffee, the best vibes, and the best rotating selection of 4 unique coffee bags from around the world (coffee bean options to take home)."
The Coffee Movement,"Great coffee. Well brewed. Enjoyed the service, mellow, felt like they weren't there to take my order and kick me out."
The Coffee Movement,"Edit: The service can improve when telling us where to queue, just the tone in general but otherwise great little spot.  I’m not the only one - read the other one star reviews"
The Coffee Movement,"Had a regular latte and vanilla rosemary latte, both are FANTASTIC! It really lives up to the hype in the other reviews. Literally one of the best espresso drinks I've ever had in the world!!!! Definitely worth a visit for any coffee lover when in SF. Very fair prices as well. You'll need to climb some hill tho."
The Coffee Movement,"Maybe the best coffee I'll ever have. If you love specialty coffee, this will be your new favorite place. Coffee purists will swoon"
The Coffee Movement,"Ordered a cappuccino, the foam was impeccable and the pour was fantastic. I also ordered a latte for my wife with the seasonal syrup, I typically do not like sweet coffee but this was done very well. No over aggressive sweetener with light hints of floral and zest. I would absolutely recommend this spot for those that enjoy the art of coffee over a quick caffeine fix."
The Coffee Movement,I had the vanilla latte with oat milk. I liked the vibes in the coffee shop and coffee was good. Sweet but not too sweet. The baristas were also friendly and one of them was fellow southerner.
The Coffee Movement,"Excellent Coffee specialities, nice location at a cable-car stop, recommendable! Team highly motivated!"
The Coffee Movement,"One of my favorite coffee shops! I think they only serve 8 oz. drinks, but the coffee is outstanding and the staff is so friendly. Decent selection of pastries as well"
The Coffee Movement,"We were on the trolly and as we passed by they waved at us so we decided to get off and get coffee. Such a cute and cozy coffee shop and not to mention how friendly these guys were. I had the cocoa cappuccino, delicious."
The Coffee Movement,Amazing coffee! It is a small cute coffee shop loaded with quality and friendly staff. Stay away from Starbucks and come get the real deal
The Coffee Movement,"Most tasty coffee in San Francisco. I went here two times during my one week stay in SF and the coffee tasted amazing both of them. The staff were very knowledgable about the different coffee varieties and they were very helpful in suggesting what I should try. Definitely worth a visit! Prepare to line up, but you won't regret it ;)"
The Coffee Movement,Really cool use of space. Beautiful coffee shop with a simple menu and both great knowledge and passion for coffee among the staff.
The Coffee Movement,"Really underwhelmed by the lack of flavor. Cappuccino was one of the most blandest coffee drinks I've ever had. Service was friendly and quick. This is just another one of the new breed 'trendy' coffee places like Ritual, Blue Bottle and Four Barrel. If you want fantastic coffee flavor head over to Caffe Trieste in North Beach, still the undisputed champion of SF coffee."
The Coffee Movement,we appreciate you giving us a try.
The Coffee Movement,A must-go for coffee lovers in SF. My trip will not be complete without it. The price is surprisingly low given it's quality.
The Coffee Movement,I used to come here all the time for ice pour over and all the sudden theh stopped making it even though they have ice?  So weird.
The Coffee Movement,"We were intrigued by the super high score but unfortunately didn't get a chance to taste the coffee. When we arrived we entered to look at the prices. A spacious place. The barista pointed out we have to queue. ""Sure, we just want to see the prices"". The answer was ""You can't be here, you can see the prices when it's your turn next to the door."" Thanks for this very warm welcome. Would not recommend this friendly place to anyone, no matter how good the coffee."
The Coffee Movement,All I can say is WOW! Perfectly balanced profiles! Stunning craft beverages! Espresso tonic = OUTSTANDING!
The Coffee Movement,"Visited for the weekend and went to this place twice. The orange cream latte (half sweet) was one of the best coffees I’ve ever had. My bf got the espresso tonic that he also loved. A bit of a wait (maybe half hr max), but well worth it. The guys who work there are friendly and passionate about what they do."
The Coffee Movement,One of the few places in the city that does coffee flights. St Frank also does one but seems to have stopped during covid. Great rotating selection of beans from top roasters. Great vibe where people actually sit/stand with their coffee and read the provided newspapers and magazines
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee at a set-up well worth checking out.  Baristas were welcoming and took the effort to explain their menu to a first-timer.  Ordered an oat-milk latte and the coffee was well balanced and smooth to taste.
The Coffee Movement,We loved everything about this coffee shop. The coffee and pastries were to die for. Also dog friendly which was a plus.
The Coffee Movement,Wonderful unpretentious coffee bar with the nicest baristas ever. I was having “one of those days” and managed to spill my full latte outside. The barista saw me and made me a new one immediately and brought it to me! Didn’t ask him to do that and he wouldn’t let me pay for it. Stellar customer service and he salvaged my day!
The Coffee Movement,Very cute and small coffee shop in the middle of Downtown SF. They have a cute selection of beverages. I strongly recommend the Vanilla Lavender Latte
The Coffee Movement,"I recently stayed in San Francisco for about a week and this became my regular spot after hearing about it from a coworker. What really resonated with me is how everyone is so friendly at this coffee shop. They all take the time to start your day off to a good start by smiling, starting a little small talk, and making you feel so welcome being there. Of course, I also came back because the coffee is good too and the almond croissants were my regular breakfast. My only suggestion is they make large size cups so we can all savor the coffee longer(I got 2 cups one morning for myself because I needed a little more caffeine fix than a standard size would give). Next time I’m in the area, this will be my place! Keep up the great work."
The Coffee Movement,Great Coffee so Good. But they offer only Milk and oat milk.
The Coffee Movement,"Small petite, very close to teh cable car. Ambiance: filled with light, standup spots to rest as well some seats outside. Service: friendly and efficient Coffee: great, well made, tried their alternative milk (hemp milk i believe) which was not my favorite but black coffee was great! Hot chocolate on the sweet side and definitely has room for improvement  Ottimo caffè anche se"
The Coffee Movement,Cute little coffee shop in a place you would never expect to be! Very good speciality coffees.
The Coffee Movement,Quaint shop for yuppies. Good coffee. A different taste.
The Coffee Movement,"super cute little coffee shop! has a little deck outside to stand and to sip your coffee. coffee wasn’t bitter, ordered a mocha. definitely want to try their flight next! the staff was super kind and helped me through the menu.  only thing to note, not a spot to go and do your work/study in if that’s why you’re looking at coffeeshops at the moment! definitely will be back though as a stop and grab before work!"
The Coffee Movement,"Fantastic coffee made properly, beans sourced from some of the best roasters like Heart from Portland, Madcap from Michigan, and St Frank locally. Definitely a great cup of Joe."
The Coffee Movement,"Wonderful people and space, affordable 4$ latte. COFFEE MOVEMENT could use some outlets to charge devices though ✌️"
The Coffee Movement,"Outstanding! Was easily the best coffee shop I tried out of the handful I hit up while in SF. I ended up trying them several times over the course of a few days. From the batch brew coffee to my beloved cappuccinos, all were outstanding. They also had a decent selection of pastries.  Only real downside, as others have noted, there is no seating inside and only four or five spots to sit outside."
The Coffee Movement,Lovely little shop with very friendly staff. Their cappuccino was one of the better ones I’ve tried in the city. Highly recommended!
The Coffee Movement,Love this cute little place for a great Italian espresso! No seating inside so perfect for a quick stop.
The Coffee Movement,"Nice place, good people. Unfortunately they didn’t have cold brew when I visited and I tried the nitro, but as always not my thing. But it seems like a place for people who take their coffee seriously and I did pick up a nice pack of coffeebeans for my coffee-loving friend."
The Coffee Movement,🤩🤩🤩My favorite part of the day is going to Movement Coffee House so that I can inhale all of the sweet smells.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The Coffee Movement,Lovely coffee shop on a quiet side street. Excellent espresso & awesome staff.
The Coffee Movement,"Staff were lovely and coffee was delicious, almond croissant also 10/10"
The Coffee Movement,"Just up the hill from Chinatown, SF. Great service and coffee. Had a mellow vibe and clearly designed to make the space operate as smoothly as possible. The baristas were very professional and made some of the best coffee I have had in SF (this was my second visit to the city). The prices are fair, considering the quality of their drinks. The pastry was tasty, too. 10/10 would go back."
The Coffee Movement,"Minimalist, bright coffee shop with a long list of interesting specials, but seems overkill if you just want an espresso (and I would have preferred a more bitter shot). Only seating is the benches outside, although you can stand inside at the window bar."
The Coffee Movement,Love the atmosphere with the nice coffee ♥️
The Coffee Movement,Awesome coffee ☕. Wish there were more seating.
The Coffee Movement,"World-class coffee in a very beautiful, boutique shop. Among the best I've ever had. Coffee flights are offered so you can compare different beans or brewing methods."
The Coffee Movement,Great experiments. Hopefully another light roast will be better paired w milk.
The Coffee Movement,"Given the waiting line and rating, I expected a very good coffee. It (cappuccino) was only good. However, that can’t be said for the Croissant, which I’d only rate as average. Also, while the staff was friendly, I got a slightly posh vibe (or maybe the relaxed attitude just doesn’t resonate with my German efficiency influenced rather precisely planned day, that didn’t include unnecessary waiting (e.g. to check the pastry selection)."
The Coffee Movement,Philipp - We appreciate your feedback.  We wish you zero unnecessary waiting for the rest of your days - your German efficiency deserves better!! We apologize for pushing your agenda back with our relaxed attitude and wish you nothing but success in your future pursuits.
The Coffee Movement,"Great coffee, friendly staff."
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee at a good price. You can't beat the quality and price point in or out of SF in the Bay Area. The pastries are good too. The staff is friendly and the service is quick and efficient for such a small place.
The Coffee Movement,"Amazing blend of flavors, coffee beans are superb, good vibes, small outdoor seating area, busy/popular line"
The Coffee Movement,"I like the coffee here, really nice. They don’t roast their own coffee however, know how to make good coffee. It’s a small coffee shop at a very random location. I will give it a 4 because social/communication skills of the baristas working there isn’t the best, and it affects the customer experience."
The Coffee Movement,So glad we stopped into this gem! Great coffee and worth the wait on a Saturday morning
The Coffee Movement,"There is a culture of interest and care here. I love grabbing a cup of coffee at Coffee Movement, and for the home brewer, there is no better selection of delicious and interesting beans in the city. Keep finding my living and work locations further and further away, but I always come back!  Fun story: During the pandemic, I was staying in Sausalito. I decided to ride my bike here to grab a few bags. When I realized I was running late, I gave them a call and while they were cleaning up after close, they sold me a few bags and gave me a lot of love for making the trip over."
The Coffee Movement,Top 3 coffee spots in all of San Francisco if not the best. The staple drinks are always fantastic and the seasonal drinks are exceptional. Also one of the best priced cafes in the city.
The Coffee Movement,Great little coffee shop located in a historic part of SF. Love the old VW parked in front
The Coffee Movement,"This place is hidden gem in China town area. The decoration look cool! Hot coffee was pretty good but for macha lover, I'm not recommend because it's too light of flavor and full fill the taste with only milk."
The Coffee Movement,"“If you have any questions on the menu, I’ve got your back,” says it all about the laid back yet sweet baristas pacing through theyre perfectly weighed out and pulled espresso shots. Friday and Saturday are too darn busy but they deserve it, best coffee I’ve had in the bay."
The Coffee Movement,"Their cocoa cappuccino is DELICIOUS (I mean, cocoa). Unfortunately there are no chairs here to sit down - the place is really tiny - so it's either takeaway or standing near the counter tops."
The Coffee Movement,"Amazing seasonal drinks, nice atmosphere, great location with view on the cable cars."
The Coffee Movement,Brian was friendly and helpful and gave a great recommendation. The coffee was great and the apple danish was the best I've ever had!
The Coffee Movement,"Coffee as expected, service can be nicer."
The Coffee Movement,"Hands down the best coffee in San Francisco, with the friendliest staff! Super fair prices as well"
The Coffee Movement,"The cocoa cappuccino was outstanding. The coffee is excellent. The pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant) was large, but quite average. The amount of chocolate for the size of the pastry was underwhelming.  BUT, definitely worth the wait for the coffee ☕"
The Coffee Movement,Outstanding everything. Possibly the best latte I’ve ever had (and unfortunately I have about 4 coffees everyday).
The Coffee Movement,"easily the best coffee in san francisco! super service minded, great minimalist design and purely delicious coffee. italian style cappuccino next to china town in san francisco, what a combo! thanks a lot! 😋 …"
The Coffee Movement,Absolute gem in San Francisco. The coffee is absolutely amazing and so is the ambiance
The Coffee Movement,Delicious pastries and the Colombian pour over was one of the best I’ve ever had.
The Coffee Movement,"waited long time, when we stepped forward just a bit a guy was shouting to us to exactly stand where the sign says, which was one step away - weird experience. coffee ok, but not great. (and no, that is not ""bashing a small business"", like you commented beyond another review, that is just my personal experience. I have been in many other small places around, trying to avoid starbucks, but if this is how you treat your customers, good luck."
The Coffee Movement,"Not allowed to sit in the shop to drink the coffee. Coffee average,  service miserable"
The Coffee Movement,"After 7 years of living here I can solidly say this is my favorite place to get coffee!! Each and every barista is so sweet and genuinely takes the time to ask how my day’s going, and the drinks are always delicious. Thanks for providing such a special little spot :)"
The Coffee Movement,"Incredible Coffee : Terrible experience. Queuing in line gave me flashbacks to 1990s America, where the power hungry line police yell at you because you step 1mm over the line. “Sir, step back from the line, or you will be Tasered”. It’s clearly a source of aggravation for staff, as it is for customers - so needs a rethink to de-escalate. Let’s hope the overall Coffee Movement experience catch’s up to its  high quality product."
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee 2 blocks away from our hotel. Simple layout and staff are very busy but still manage to ask how your day is going. Our go to place for the morning brew
The Coffee Movement,Really great espresso drinks all around. I'm not a fan of sugary espresso drinks and this place has the perfect balance of sweetness and coffee in all of their drinks. I love the house made seasonal syrups (right now it's some sort of orange zest I think) because they are light and refreshing. They also have a traditional European style of cappuccino. Definitely worth a stop!
The Coffee Movement,"Hmmmmm 4.9 stars, seems suspicious BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS NOT.  What we have here is super solid coffee, at a very reasonable price, in frankly charming, delightful, and minimalist aesthetic, with some terrific pastries to boot.  And the folks working here?  Cheerful, knowledgeable, and efficient.  Worth a ten minute walk at the very least."
The Coffee Movement,This is my go to for coffee when visiting family in the city.  I love the vibe and service.
The Coffee Movement,"Ordered a cappuccino, great cup of coffee. Also the barista was super friendly! Would recommend!"
The Coffee Movement,My friend brought me there and said I just need to taste cappuccino. And what can I say — here you can find the best coffee in the city!
The Coffee Movement,Had a single origin drip and almond croissant to go! Great coffee and friendly staff!
The Coffee Movement,"Loving the baristas, services were great. It is a minimalist design cafe serving coffee with beautiful taste notes. I love it! This will be my favorite coffee place in SF, there is limited outdoor seats outside and no indoor seating. But it is located in between Nob Hill and Chinatown, get a cup of joe and walk around!"
The Coffee Movement,"This place hopes to address to the ‘transactional nature of American cafes’…I’m baffled how a sleek hole in the wall where you drink out front standing does this, but corporate aspirations ain’t my vibe. The offering is limited, refined and delicious. Best coffee in SF. Love, Melbourne."
The Coffee Movement,"I waited for some long time in the line, and I thought that it would probably make sense and was worthy…. BUT no!!  When I entered the place, the rude staff told me to stand where is the sign and wait to be called…  Coffee is average and expensive for what I had expected… not good experience at all, overrated place"
The Coffee Movement,Their seasonal flavored lattes are sooo good and the baristas are super nice. Their specialty drinks are never too sweet and have awesome flavor. It's also really fun to do the tasting flights if you are looking for new beans to buy! Also the pastries they stock are great! I love the almond croissant!
The Coffee Movement,"Hidden gem in Nob Hill. Fantastic coffee options. Great, fast service (don't hesitate to ask for recommendations). While this cafe has no seating at the moment it does have a great outdoor truck with newspapers to pause for a bit before continuing onwards."
The Coffee Movement,Really good coffee! Will return.
The Coffee Movement,A gourmet cup. Also the friendliest and most knowledgable staff ever. Delicious seasonal specialties too. I had the ginger spice latte w/oatmilk. Yum!!
The Coffee Movement,"Super cute place with on-point aesthetics, really good coffee and pastries. Definitely easier to walk or maybe bike to than drive to since I think parking in the area would be difficult."
The Coffee Movement,"This place is all about the coffee, and yes the coffee is great.  The cafe has a minimalistic vibe which extenuates the focus on the coffee.  Will I go back"
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee and cool vibe. You look around and you feel you are in SF.
The Coffee Movement,"Best cappuccino in the city, if you ask me! (And I've tried a LOT of coffee shops!)"
The Coffee Movement,Delicious! There us always a queue but it is really quick! Also surprisingly on the cheaper side considering we are in SF! Had a cappuccino and it was perfect
The Coffee Movement,"Easily the best coffee in San Francisco. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, quick service (the line may be long on weekends, but it moves fast) and bomb coffee. I stayed above this place for a month back in September, and I miss my daily (sometimes twice daily) coco cappuccino :("
The Coffee Movement,Excellent coffee. The option of a coffee flight is delightful and appropriate given the care and knowledge of the baristas in choosing an interesting spectrum of coffees. Would recommend. Would come again.  If you’re a desperate caffeine addict order two to get a full punch. Croissant wasn’t bad but wasn’t worth buying again unless notably hungry.
The Coffee Movement,"Fantastic espresso. The barista knows his stuff, even using measure scale to ensure exact amount of grind to get the correct brewing time Awesome result."
The Coffee Movement,"Unpretentious yet high styling chill vibes high quality professionally crafted coffee in beautifully designed interior and exterior space (coffee truck) plus well curated music. Oh, did i mention the people who run this place are super friendly and amazing all around.  So, my favorite shop in all of SF."
The Coffee Movement,"Loved the coffee, and planning to come back and try more! The place is beautifully renovated, and there is some space to enjoy the coffee inside."
The Coffee Movement,"A hole in the wall,  but they definitely make the best coffee around the area.  Highly recommend Cocoa latte !"
The Coffee Movement,Exceptional coffee and service. Highly recommend. Inspired by Australian coffee culture.
The Coffee Movement,"Really nice people the coffee IST really good also. I would recommend hands down if your getting of the cart in Chinatown get your coffee here, it's right of the market wagon cart. Try their orange coffee"
The Coffee Movement,Popular local coffee joint on a hill. No indoor seating
The Coffee Movement,I needed coffee and this one was the closest to where I was. The coffee was fine but the people who works there could be friendlier.
The Coffee Movement,I happened to walk by this place after climbing the mountainous San Francisco roads and saw a line out the door. Waited in it as I caught my breath to see what the fuss was about.  The Americano was the best coffee I had all week.
The Coffee Movement,"Great neighborhood coffee shop, especially on a sunny day it is so nice to sit outside and enjoy coffee and a pastry! Very friendly service and I loved the seasonal latte."
The Coffee Movement,"The conversation with baristas was enjoyable and came with exceptional service and attention to detail. The coffee itself (a single source, I like it black) was absolutely among the best I've ever had. I'll be coming back."
The Coffee Movement,Simply the best in town.
The Coffee Movement,Nice and good price
The Coffee Movement,The coffee movement was a small bit elegant coffee shop.  This coffee shop had a lot of personality from the brightly lot glass windows to all the Polaroids of customers that have been there.  The two gentleman that helped us were awesome as well and made one of the best cups of coffee I have had in a long time. If you are ever in San Fran id definitely check them out.
The Coffee Movement,"Interesting flavor of lavender infused vanilla latte, worth a try."
The Coffee Movement,"Staff is always exceptionally friendly and a joy to speak with. Their coffee is high quality too, of course. Even a simple latte feels special here."
The Coffee Movement,"Great service and coffee. If you're an Australian looking for good coffee in San Fran, then this is the place to go!"
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee. Got their seasonable vanilla lavender latte which I enjoyed a lot  They do not have indoor seating but there are some chairs out in the front
The Coffee Movement,Very nice coffee. Smooth and balanced
The Coffee Movement,"My bf and I were exploring Chinatown when I was craving a coffee, and this is one of the few fancy-ish coffee places I found nearby (using Yelp of course) that was still open on a late Saturday afternoon. It did not disappoint. The place was small but clean and well-decorated in a minimalistic style. The staff were friendly and welcoming right from the get-go, and they were patient while we figured out what to order. I ordered a cappuccino (can't knock the classics) which tasted good and was also presented all pretty ;). The only minor downside is it got really got inside since the sun was out; but it was much more comfortable to sit outside on a bench once one freed up. I'm not in this area much, but the next time I am, I'd definitely consider coming here again :)"
The Coffee Movement,Delicious! Great prices
The Coffee Movement,"The place is great and seems to do great business. Very glad that it’s in the neighborhood! But I really have to ask… do they know about the name? Like, they must be in on the joke, right?"
The Coffee Movement,"Coffee is top quality 👌  Don't skip it, must do."
The Coffee Movement,Epic coffee. Love the minimalist hipster aesthetic of the place. The built in machine is super cool. I mean really cool. Finally an American coffee shop that makes a decent flat white. Friendly dudes who are passionate about their craft. This coffee shop would not be out of place in Sydney or Melbourne.
The Coffee Movement,"Adorable little cafe with great brews and delicious cappuccinos. Had a morning bun and a croissant as well, both delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed this find and seriously good coffee. Looking forward to going back. Keep in mind, it’s quite small so not your sit down coffee and laptop joint, but a great grab and go cup for a catch up with friends and walk around the area."
The Coffee Movement,Great coffe . Love it i miss San Francisco and the most the people.
The Coffee Movement,"Best coffee in the downtown area! Very kind, sweet and friendly staff; and the coffee they make is perfection!! The taste, coffee-milk proportions and the latte art - everything is spot on!"
The Coffee Movement,10/10 coffee and cappuccino with reasonable prices!
The Coffee Movement,"As attractive & well-designed as this professional space strives to be, with reasonable beans selection, etc - the ""filter"" offer is ambiguous, at best. Serving batch brew instead of pour-over is definitely more efficient, from business standpoint, no need to practice persuading anyone. However, a clear terminology is rather a standard expectation, from the client's perspective - no point in misleading your patrons."
The Coffee Movement,"Absolutely love this place! Focusing on the finer details of preparing an exquisite cup of globally-inspired coffee, they are setting a new standard of service and quality for enjoying the best cup of coffee in San Francisco!  I highly recommend checking this out and trying everything you can! The piccolo is my favorite!"
The Coffee Movement,"I work in coffee and have known the owners for years. These days Coffee Movement is my favorite cafe in SF - I make a special trip from Potrero to come here. It’s so great to see rotating selection of coffees from the best roasters in the world, brewed expertly, and served with phenomenal hospitality."
The Coffee Movement,Great Coffee Spot Loved it! You guys are a slice of Amazing
The Coffee Movement,"A small coffee shop with a beautiful interior. The  staff are very friendly and will always keep up a great conversation. The espressos are delicious, the baristas are able to pull the shots just at the right time."
The Coffee Movement,Cute hole in the wall coffee shop.  They are super friendly and the cappuccino was the best.
The Coffee Movement,"damn good espresso. both visits had me try some wild, funky single-origin espressos from roasteries across the country. also had amazing bags of coffee  at the same time, they also refused to get me a cortado. I understand that they only pull quad shots but give me TWO cortados. I will pay for it. I didn't want to drink a straight-up espresso shot but they did it anyway"
The Coffee Movement,"Sorta like if the soup na*i had a neurotic child who sold coffee. Lots of weird nervous energy about where to stand, how to not block the door, how many people in at once, etc. good coffee."
The Coffee Movement,"The best cappuccino in the city so far! It reminds me of the European baristas, Lisboa or Venice, in most places I visited in Europe they don’t make a frothy, hot milk shake type cappuccino as you may encounter in the US. I’m very happy that the Coffee Movement has a great staff and taste! The milk is heated perfectly to the right consistency."
The Coffee Movement,"Best coffee in the city! Beautiful space, incredible coffee, friendly staff and reasonable prices .. highly recommend!"
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee and pastries!
The Coffee Movement,"Both baristas were so sweet and kind, and the whole environment was really calm, relaxed, and beautiful. I was from out of of town, but they seemed to know the whole neighborhood, and waved at people as they passed. They immediately made me feel like they knew me too, and I fit right in. Bonus: the coffee was delicious."
The Coffee Movement,The Best coffee in the city. Delicious latte. Friendly staff.
The Coffee Movement,"Some of the best coffee and pastries I've had in the city. Super friendly team. Good way to start your day. Don't be put off by a line, it moves really fast."
The Coffee Movement,"Fantastic little spot doing great specialty coffee. We had a terrific natural process Ethiopian iced, and it was delicious. Great service, relaxing, and friendly place. We can see why it’s got five stars!"
The Coffee Movement,"I give the Coffee Movement 5 stars because they earned them in a few key ways. 1st and most importantly the espresso shots were pulled perfectly at the ideal temp, moderate crema, with a nicely palatable, balanced, earthy roast not too acidic, mature single-origin beans, not over-roasted as is the custom in the Seattle based chains I won't even name here. 2nd they didn't have a long menu of smartly named sweetened syrup drinks, they had only a single seasonal lavender vanilla sweetener, and a hot cocoa and a mixed Earl grey tea drink, but I was able to please my teenaged kids with those drinks and didn't miss the silly menu items that may as well all just be called ""sucrose overdose"" that I am accustomed to seeing back home in my Salt Lake City coffee houses. 3rd the barista was friendly and prompt and poured the milk perfectly at the right temp. Now just a word to the wise coffee drinker, especially if you're a bit of a purist like me. I like espresso shots pulled expertly and whole milk steamed to just before a froth. The barista told me that they served Capp's in an 8oz. Cup and other drinks in a 10 oz. Cup. I wish I had taken that clue and ordered my usual hot whole milk latte no sweeteners in the 8 oz cup. The 10 oz cup was probably 2 oz of milk too much for me as it detracted from the flavor of the lovely roasted beans and the perfect espresso shots. So if you want a latte and you want to experience the bean's flavor, maybe you should consider ordering the latte in an 8 oz cup, or just order the Cappuccino and have them go light on the foam. I won't hold my slight displeasure against them as I was the one doing the ordering and I was not familiar with the roast here being from out of town. During my visit to SF I got coffee from Saint Frank's (also a 5 star experience) and here at The Coffee Movement. I will say I preferred the roast at Saint Frank's and their ratio just a little more, but I was thoroughly impressed with both and will take back my new expectations for coffee shops to my hometown. The Coffee Movement knows how to pull a shot and pour a delicious latte. If you've been drinking Starbucks or Peet's you're missing out on what San Fransisco has to offer."
The Coffee Movement,"Not cozy by any means, not comfortable but by far the best coffee I've had in SF so far.  The beans they sell are top quality too."
The Coffee Movement,Nice spot for espresso The assortment of newspapers is a nice touch
The Coffee Movement,"Awesome high quality coffee and pastries, super affordable and great service (safe, quick and helps you explore your caffeine sweet spot).  ☕ Rotating roster of blend and great espresso grind. Recommend getting a picollo. 🗨️ Ask the knowledge baristas if you have any questions. 🥐 Pastries are delicious! 😷 Safe thoughtful space. 👍 Affordable for your daily coffee fix."
The Coffee Movement,Hands down the best coffee shop in SF. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They carry an assortment of boutique coffees and merchandise. I have never had a bad coffee here.
The Coffee Movement,"I was at Nob Hill looking for some coffee in the morning and stumbled into this lovely little spot. I asked for a mocha. The barista said no problem and even asked if I wanted any sugar added. I thought that a lovely detail. I got a sticky buns pastry that was amazing. The mocha and the sticky bun were a great, decadent Friday morning breakfast."
The Coffee Movement,Best coffee I’ve had in the USA from an Aussie
The Coffee Movement,"Good coffee, sorta weird vibe with rude staff"
The Coffee Movement,I was showing a friend San Francisco and he wanted to try the coffee because apparently SF is known for it. I'm so glad we chose this place. Seriously the best espresso drinks I've ever had and they also have excellent vegan options.
The Coffee Movement,My new favorite local coffee spot. Great vibes and coffee!
The Coffee Movement,Excellent coffee and very friendly staff.
The Coffee Movement,"Nice people serving incredible coffee, with optional inspired tweaks on traditional drinks.  Try the piccolo with cocoa if you want a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.  Also their homemade almond milk is insanely good."
The Coffee Movement,First stop for coffee once I hit San Francisco again. Friendly staff gave us some knowledge of the area. Ended up coming back a couple times. Hope to visit again soon!
The Coffee Movement,Coffee is big part of my life I am really picky about what to get and where from. This little coffee shop has its own character and really relaxing. I think the owners are creating their own culture in coffee industry. I love it! Smoothest coffee that i’ve had in a while
The Coffee Movement,"Some of the best coffee in SF. I met the owner Brian in a workout class and have made the coffee movement a part of my day since then. Cool spot, friendly baristas, and even better coffee!"
The Coffee Movement,I never thought that a hint of orange would taste so amazing in a latte!
The Coffee Movement,Awesome coffee shop! Great friendly service and ownership! A must stop if in the area!!
The Coffee Movement,"Delicious coffee and speciality drinks! Chai latte and espresso tonic were very good. Friendly and informative staff as well. Expect to wait in line, but worth it!"
The Coffee Movement,"They were absolutely amazing until we recently saw one of the baristas take cash with his hands and use the same hand, during pandemic, to pour coffee and clean the tip of the espresso machine. Honestly, kind people too. But pandemic or not, this is just not a pleasant sight to see."
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee. Zen environment and fantastic service. Did I say the coffee was great 😀 …
The Coffee Movement,"Im a nomad. Literally. I haven't lived anywhere more than three years in my life. This has led to a challenge in finding acceptable coffee in a New city/town, but through providence, an impeccable palate, and a lot of coffee sipped and immediately thrown in the nearest garbage... i can usually sniff out the best.  These guys are the best.  I worked as a barista on Kauai's north shore for a year from feeling burned out as a chef. There i discovered an intense passion ans well as innate skill for the extraction process of espresso through my love of procedure and my palate. Trilogy Coffee Kauai made third wave coffee and has similar design concepts as well as the exact same service and skills as The Coffee Movement.  Game recognize Game.  I would work for you guys in a heart beat and I'll see you every day for my breve piccolo.  I love you."
The Coffee Movement,"Suuuch tasty lattes, nice baristas, beautiful interior, nothing not to love."
The Coffee Movement,"This coffee shop is really a place you should visit if you are a coffee lover. The guys are doing an amazing job, hope they will open more stores with the same service."
The Coffee Movement,"Amazing quality beans, preparation & service. Glad we decided to try it as we walked past. The two owners are very passionate about coffee and also humble not to make you feel out of place no matter what your experience is. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend."
The Coffee Movement,"Exceptionally good local coffee shop serving pour over, cold brew and espresso style drinks.  The place is small inside, and would be take out even in normal times, but a great quality product and place staffed with friendly people."
The Coffee Movement,Great little coffee shop...some of the best coffee I've had in a long time. If you are riding the cable car get off near the Cable Car Museum and walk down the hill....coffee shop is on the left...
The Coffee Movement,"This place absolutely deserves the 5.0 star rating!  Pros: - Amazingly prepared coffee!  One of the best lattes I've had, and certainly at the very very top of decaf lattes.   Small'ish in size, big'ish in taste!  And of course, nice latte art :) - Delightful staff!  I met both of the baristas, each named Brian.  Friendly, sincere, and helpful!  You know, the sort who ask you how your day is and actually care about knowing. - Cozy. No room for laptop'ing... and I list this as a pro even though I came in with a laptop. I ended up standing and people watching.  Note: - Not good for a large group - Or for camping out with a laptop.  This is not an office; that's what Starbucks is for. - May not be comfortable for those in a wheelchair given the tight space. - I imagine parking would be challenging  Okay, I have to say more about the latte.  You know that wonderful coffee smell?  That roasted-but-not-too-bitter-or-acidic taste of coffee ice cream?  That was this latte (without added sugar!).  Not wimpy or ""light"" by any means, but rather full-flavored, smooth and creamy.  Undoubtedly a combination of quality beans and skilled preparation.  Only downside is that espresso drinks like this spoil you for the 90+% of the rest of the time when espresso'ing :\/"
The Coffee Movement,Vanilla lavender latte
The Coffee Movement,"This place is like a little cubby hole. Just opened 6 weeks ago.  Honestly, didn’t think the location works, but it does.  More important. Quality service; really attentive to the customer. No pressure place. CLEAN environment.  Decent selection of coffee and coffee related products.  Good pour. Good coffee.  Feels like one can just hang,  chat and sip on a cup forever here."
The Coffee Movement,"The owners of this place truly make this shop special. Their kindness and knowledge about coffee translates beautifully into a delicious cup and a delightful conversation. I left this place with a greater knowledge about coffee than when I entered. If that’s not a movement, then I don’t know what is!"
The Coffee Movement,"Need a quality espresso drink in an area without many places, this is THE place to go. Very welcoming, professional, and delicious coffee."
The Coffee Movement,Live near here and come in to get a coffee/latte often! The quality and friendliness of the baristas is unmatched. One of my favorite coffee shops in SF!
The Coffee Movement,My favorite coffee shop in SF! Great coffee - they make delicious cappuccinos - and great service.
The Coffee Movement,"First off, very friendly and kind staff. This place isn't cheap but the prices are reasonable since they're competing against the likes of Blue Bottle etc. There's a smaller selection of drinks but I would pick it over Blue Bottle (which I also like) for sure anytime."
The Coffee Movement,Unique espresso creations and a super attentive staff. Loved this place
The Coffee Movement,"Amazing coffee shop. There is no wrong choice here, everything is done well. 100% recommended."
The Coffee Movement,A contender for the best coffee I've had. Rosemary Vanilla latte was superb. Staff was friendly & welcoming.
The Coffee Movement,Absolutely amazing coffee. The guys are real coffee artisans. Best coffee I've had in the US.  Highly recommend jumping off the cable car at the stop outside their place and reward yourself
The Coffee Movement,Great coffee and the baristas we're extremely friendly. Very cheap too!!
The Coffee Movement,Amazing execution and it’s clear that they have a passion for what they do. Hard to find a better cup of coffee than this.
The Coffee Movement,"Beautiful design, great service, and amazing coffee. The Vanilla Rosemary latte had a hint of sweetness ans was perfectly balanced."
The Coffee Movement,Amazing coffee at an amazing price for the quality.  The specialty coffees are especially good
The Coffee Movement,Amazing little place. The coffee is exceptional and the staff are polite and welcoming. Definitely my favourite neighbourhood coffee haunt!
The Coffee Movement,Very good coffee!! Awesome service! A cute little coffee shop !!
The Coffee Movement,Amazing esthetic! The guys behind bar were super friendly and the attention to detail was on point. The Espresso tonic was refreshing. A must see for a minimalist hole in the wall coffee bar.
The Coffee Movement,Have good chat while you get your coffee made.
The Coffee Movement,"idk why people love it so much, just okay and very long line. similar to sighglass coffee with a less enjoyable experience"
The Coffee Movement,Phenomenal coffee. Seasonal ginger spice latte was amazing. I understand why there is a big line if you don't get there early!
The Coffee Movement,"Amazing, Melbourne style coffee in the heart of San Fran."
The Coffee Movement,They automatically press the 15% tip button for themselves. The baristas weren't even turning the Square payment screen around to let you press a tip amount but instead were pressing the 15% for themselves. That makes me not want to come here anymore.
The Coffee Movement,.
The Coffee Movement,"BEST COFFEE IN SF!  Recently crowned top barista in the world, Reef Bessette, has joined Bryan  Overstreet's dream project to create s truely one of a kind exoexperie. From their home made almond milk to having four different beans that they serve via drip, pour over or iced, this place is a coffee lovers paradise."
The Coffee Movement,Very tasty coffee and friendly service

The Coffee Movement,Great piccolo and cappuccino! Offers decaf and Australian style Cap.

The Coffee Movement,"A cafe located in San Francisco, USA. Located near Nob Hill near Union Square, you can feel the hill atmosphere of San Fran. It opens at 7 and closes at 4, so it's good to enjoy coffee early in the morning.  There are general espresso and latte menus, as well as cocoa cappuccino, drip coffee sampler, and matcha latte. I think I went two or three times a week. You can't eat inside the store, but you can eat there by making a stand in front of the drug. The beans are not roasted directly, but they use local St. Frank coffee. I've had it before at St. Frank's Coffee Shop in Menlo Park and it was great. The machine uses modbar. These days, it's used in a few places in Korea, and it's an undercounter machine made in collaboration with La Marzocco. There is only an espresso tap on which a porter can be inserted, so it is sensuous.  Taste sampler, latte, cappuccino, etc. Eating delicious beans and freshly brewed coffee in the weather of San Fran is just over. What was really special was the sampler. You can eat while comparing the taste of different beans, so you can accurately find your taste.  The third wave (?) represented by Blue Bottle and Fields Coffee. A must-visit cafe in San Francisco, the origin of coffee. San Fran's unique vibe."
The Coffee Movement,"I drank cocoa cappuccino, but I don't know what's different from just soft cappuccino. I thought it was cappuccino and drank it, but it was a delicious cappuccino The service is just normal ordering, making and calculating, and mechanically. Looks like covid rules still apply. The atmosphere is the way the tram goes, so you can feel the San Francisco feeling. second visit"
The Coffee Movement,I'm tired of the vibe and the coffee is so good You can order a sampler and make it your own. I smelled flowers Espresso Tonic is not my taste. San Francisco sensibility is felt here
The Coffee Movement,"They said the coffee was very good, so I went hiking (?) up a steep hill to find it. If you line up one by one outside, you will be called and order coffee from the barista and pay. I ordered the Cocoa Cappuccino because it was the signature menu here. It was good coffee. However, I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of a sit down drink option and the lack of giving customers multiple explanations and choices. It was not a place where the beans were roasted, but it felt like the baristas were making coffee with more care."
The Coffee Movement,"Very good coffee. There may be a bit of a wait depending on the time of day, but it's worth it if you're not in a hurry. However, there are no seats and only standing room, which should be considered before visiting. Recommendation is the Cocoa Cappuccino."
The Coffee Movement,Good specialty coffee offering single origin. Terrace in the street where you can enjoy your drink and watch the cable cars go by!
The Coffee Movement,"The cappucino (3dolls50) was perfectly executed. The coffee was well rounded in the mouth, not at all bitter. The counter set up in a truck opposite the shop is original."
The Coffee Movement,"Best coffee I've had in America! Next time, I'll drink orange coffee rather than soda!"
The Coffee Movement,coffee cream soda - world class surprise. definitely try.  one of the best coffee drinks i enjoyed ever. can recommend.
The Coffee Movement,"Minimalist place to drink coffee standing! The attention is excellent, among the details of the place, it has a Polaroid camera so that you can take a photo and leave it there, it has several coffee books and they also sell coffee beans so that you can prepare elsewhere, a hidden gem in san francisco"
The Coffee Movement,"The first bite is delicious, but if you keep eating it, it's too thick. Even if you like thick things, drink the least strong or the second among the three types of drip."
The Coffee Movement,"Excellent coffee, I liked it much more than Ritual or Blue Bottle. Suffice to say, it justified going down and back up from the Fairmont."
The Coffee Movement,"Hip, cool Nordic design, there's also oat milk and sensational pastries"
The Coffee Movement,Extra coffees and excellent pastries
The Coffee Movement,"Coffee is so delicious. However, judging from the dampness of the croissant I ate in the morning, I think I bought the bread the day before."
The Coffee Movement,"Sometimes there is no place to stay, there is usually a lot of people at certain times and the place is relatively small but everything is very good"
The Coffee Movement,"I drank Guatemala single origin, and the flower scent is amazing. Highly recommend a treasure-like cafe in Chinatown!!"
The Coffee Movement,The best espresso in all of San Francisco....said by an Italian!❤️
