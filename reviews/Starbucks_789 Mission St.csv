Starbucks,"This place gets super crowded after 8:30am on weekdays, I had to wait over 20 min for my coffee.  Order ahead and save half an hour of your day.  The place doesn't have any seating, like a lot of Starbucks in San Francisco. Not sure why it is that way.  Coffee is as good as any Starbucks, food options are the same.  This is a take out place, not a Starbucks where you will relax and spend an hour having your coffee."
Starbucks,"How can there not be any tables or chairs, with the huge amount of floor space you have available? Not only is it wasted real estate and wasted space you’re paying for rent, but it’s also a waste for the customers who see a store and want to sit down but can’t because there’s nowhere to sit down on!"
Starbucks,"Worst Starbucks ever! Poor customer service, needs more staff so drinks can be prepared faster. No seating! Tables dirty. No idea why the coffee is so weak is US Starbucks? Nothing else to say really!"
Starbucks,"Great location (understand that it will have busy moments throughout the day), super kind staff. Definitely will visit again!"
Starbucks,"I love Starbucks, but this one definitely lacked customer service. The staff were not friendly at all. I asked for a pink drink and it literally looked and tasted like dirty grey water and had no strawberries in it at all. I showed them a photo of what a pink drink should look like and they just stared at me like I was crazy. They eventually made another which was exactly what a pink drink should be. Very lazy and rude."
Starbucks,"Service is good, but the whole place urgently needs some clean up work, dirt just everywhere, windows, walls. Should not be a massive effort to make it shiny."
Starbucks,Your typical starbucks outlet. Not the best food but they suffice on such a cold day. No seats at all in this outlet (just standing tables) so that's a pity
Starbucks,Very slow service. Nice folks working the counter but they need more support to handle larger crowds.
Starbucks,"Great location, friendly staff and the drinks came out perfect and quickly.  Love the Double Smoked Bacon, Cheddar n Egg Sandwich, we also had Yogurt and the Bacon, Gouda & Egg Sandwich.. All was great.."
Starbucks,"They close extremely early, I lose my debit card there and they didn't help me to find or look into because they said It was illegal to enter, so at the end I lost the opportunity to use my card because I was there on holidays."
Starbucks,"No any chair can be taken , 😢I came here for relax after long walk"
Starbucks,"Worst Starbucks I’ve been too yet. From the moment we walked in, it was disgustingly messy, urine and toilet paper scattered across the bathroom floor, baristas let coffees sit on bar without notifying customers our coffees we ready, refuse to call out coffee orders, staff not in uniform but in gym shorts, staff’s attitude not “wanting to be here” or refuse to greet customer, grab n go fridge was scarce, and the list goes on. Seriously don’t come here. Worth walking to the nearest location. Side note: my iced latte which is simplest to make, wasn’t even worth the hassle here."
Starbucks,"Great service as always, our breakfast go to for food and coffee!"
Starbucks,Not your typical Starbucks; it needs a good cleaning and the baristas might need a refresher or two on certain drinks.
Starbucks,Busy location longer than usual waits but they have nice employees here.
Starbucks,Great place for a fast refreshment!
Starbucks,"Probably the worst Starbucks I’ve ever seen. People working here are bored out of their minds. Wrong order, they forgot the food, this place is not remotely as clean as it should be. 🤢🤢🤢 …"
Starbucks,"This location is a bit small, total of 5 tables: 2 high and 3 low. This is the dirtiest Starbucks that I have visited. I don't blame the employees. I blame Martha and other tourists who left behind their trashes, especially the paper from the straw."
Starbucks,7am. no customers. no dark roast.  no cream cheese. music loud so repeated my order 3 times.  tried to use stars.  cashier mumbled something and my card got charged.  cashier mask on below nose then seems to mumble.  im ok with a mask but if you use it wrong then skip it.  then had to fix my order.  yikes hard pass.  coffee luke warm and odd taste.  i drink a lot of starbucks
Starbucks,Huge space - not even one chair. Service is not friendly. Just find somewhere else to buy coffee.
Starbucks,I'll always love Starbucks. The kids running these coffee shops are so professional now. I love the consistency of my coffee flavors when then they make it for me. It just tastes better. They brew love and serve happiness in a cup.❤️
Starbucks,It's Starbucks! High top tables only when I went there
Starbucks,"Very friendly staff, quick service even when busy."
Starbucks,"Short on staff and poor service. I practically had to raise my voice to say ""excuse me"" so I could ask them for a Splenda for my coffee."
Starbucks,It said on the door/times that it closes at 6pm. It was 5:45pm and they didn't let me in.
Starbucks,The Lady with the name Pina is absolutely gorgeous and amazing! She always provide best customer service every time!
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for the taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,"The only thing that this morning goes through 3 venti cafes and I do not understand why the blonde double shop venti just because I ordered it with little ice, they give me the medium size in a large glass .. I think they should remove the venti because it is the size  big is a robbery"
Starbucks,"Worst experience ever.. the staff worst service,  order late, no comunication,  bathroom worst ever. Need a good manager with proper skills and staff willing to work not just for a paycheck"
Starbucks,"Nice customer service, great coffee."
Starbucks,"There were no caribou coffee shops so Starbucks was it. On our last day on vacation we stopped in placed the order but while waiting noticed there was someone completing the orders and calling out the names. Maybe it was the mask but we couldn't hear anything so I asked her to speak up, she stopped looked at me and boldly said NO!"
Starbucks,made the wrong order for me twice and the place was extremely dirty
Starbucks,Cashier was reading messages from her phone while taking orders
Starbucks,"I understand it’s difficult time to hire now, but this location keeps having employers who have no clue at work. It would’ve be nice to have them trained instead slowing down the whole line in the morning ."
Starbucks,"Horrible customer service minus Matthew. Walked in for 3 drinks, sandwiches  and 2 San Francisco mugs. My husband and I collect them from all over the world. I give the lady $100 bill. Guess what no change and no bags for my items. Just unacceptable. Do better!"
Starbucks,"I was glad that they had their blonde roast ready to serve during both of my visits. The staff was friendly and efficient. I'm not a huge Starbucks fan, but they did earn repeat business from me. 🙂 …"
Starbucks,My order was not right. No tables to sit inside.
Starbucks,So close to Fisherman!
Starbucks,It was freezing cold after exiting the cable car. Ducked in here to grab a hot beverage.  Service was great as well as my coffee. Store and tables were clean. I purchased a new mug to start my collection over (lost many because of the Camp Fire) keep up the great service.
Starbucks,"Nice quick service, however is a bit small and could have more seating."
Starbucks,The seating in the previously posted photos has been removed
Starbucks,"Nice little place. The only thing it’s is only take out. But at least service is fast, friendly, and tasty like always. Even they speak Spanish. Clean bathroom too."
Starbucks,"A cashier was a liar. After I purchased a coffee, I asked the passcode of the restroom. He said that the restroom was out of order. When I was back after 10 min, I saw that another customer was using the restroom."
Starbucks,"Just of  the ship Great place for coffee and a chat. It has good fast and free WiFi most importantly. The staff are plesently nice and also three is a good selection of food for a fast getaway seem a popular place. Forgot to mention real close to fisherman's wharf,and pier 39, a must do."
Starbucks,"This is a very good location as it is near the Fisherman's wharf and next to the cable car turn station. I would give 5 stars, but sometimes when you ask them for Decaf coffee, they just tell you that they are out of it and if you don't precisely ask them to make some more, sometimes they won't offer to make more hoping you will just go away. If you ask them to make some more, they will but I feel that you should not beg them to make Decaf coffee at the coffee place (it's not like I am asking for free coffee). Almost every gas station has Decaf coffee and I feel that it's not too much to ask for a Coffee place to serve Decaf coffee at any time of the day while they are still open for service. Also, find that many of the homeless people end up using their restroom and many times they restroom smells so bad that it's hard to breath in the restroom. I understand that they can not habe someone sit by the door of the restroom to  keep homeless people washing themselves in there, but perhaps have a code lock on the door, and that way, I feel less of the homeless people will be showering in there, etc... Otherwise, the place is a good place to stop by and they also have decent size sit down area to enjoy your coffee."
Starbucks,I went here last week.  Of course the bathroom was closed because a homeless druggie spread feces around on the floor.  Employee was there with door open wondering what to do.  They told me Trader Joe's down the street had a public restroom.  Great open door policy.  Enjoy it.
Starbucks,Typical Starbucks. Can't really get any different other than the staff and how the beverages are made. Completely satisfied other than it bring consistantly crowded until late at night. Nice feature about the place though are the wireless charging pads that are built into the large table in the middle. I have the Galaxy Note 8 so it supports the wireless charging facilities but it is limited to a trickle charge which can take quite a while. While it is a nice touch you are better off being your own charger and plugging it in an available outlet.
Starbucks,Good location next to Mason and Powell cable car turn around point.
Starbucks,"Yes, it's like all the other Starbucks, but the consistency should be noted.  I'll be honest, I detest Starbucks coffee milk drinks, but when you want a coffee dessert in liquid form, a consistent frappuccino can really hit the spot.  So I'll add a star because you get what you expect every single time."
Starbucks,"Great taste and great value if you follow their e-coupons promotions. Special happy hours promo, 150 stars bonus promotion plus many opportunities to collect stars to redeem your food or drink."
Starbucks,"Worst Starbucks I have been to consistently. They always mess up the coffees, whether it be terrible espresso (tastes super burnt), bad mixes with too much syrup, or just missing supplies such as the right cups for the drink.  Normally when I go to Starbucks I don't have to worry about the quality of the coffee, but not at this one. I will be looking for another Starbucks / coffee shop close to me now."
Starbucks,"Wow! I have never ever been to a Starbucks and thought to myself ""this place is disgusting""..... Well today those were my thoughts when I went to this Starbucks. There was no way I was in a Starbucks but I was and it wasn't just the bathrooms as the pictures below show. It was the whole store. And the worst thing is it was dead so they could have been cleaning up the nasty floors with coffee stains and trash throughout the store but no they were just standing around talking. And on top of that he was training someone (suppose to be training)so now he is teaching the new person bad habits. It really saddens me that a Starbucks was in that bad of shape."
Starbucks,"Matthew is not nice. I walk in, say “Hi, how are you?!” He just looks at me with a frown and says, “What can i get for you?” Then when I said I don’t want a receipt he rolled his eyes. My husband and I will not go back. Gave it one star because my drink was good."
Starbucks,"Avoid this places!!! My husband and I visited San Francisco’s for our anniversary, we passed by this location on our way to the pier, we ordered around $30 on sandwiches, snacks and 2 coffees(we didn’t got a receipt). When we received our order a coffee was missing, my husband went up to the cashier (a very unhappy lady between 40-50 yrs) he tells her “I’m sorry, I am missing a coffee” her answer was “So” with a straight face. My husband said “well, can I get my coffee?” She looked at my husband again with a straight face and said “so are you going to order?” Please train your crew on how to handle this situation and also teach them some manners."
Starbucks,Great location for a Starbucks. The baristas were actually talented as well.
Starbucks,"Very bad service. No place to sit down. I was told this is what they do on July 4th. Unoccupied chair was available. I was told chair was for employees only. Boss's orders. I asked to speak with Boss. Boss not there, would have to call. I advised I am diabetic, I need a place to sit. I was told it doesn't matter. If you want to drink your coffee sitting down don't go to this Starbuck's today!"
Starbucks,"The cashier yelled us and run us from the place, because they were going to close. That happened on December 31st at the nigth. We were two different families  and she told us "" get out of here, move move"" while she moved her hand and stayed  on the door.  This service is Terrible, dont go to this place."
Starbucks,"Not enough seats, the usual dronelike Apple laptop crowd monopolizing all available seating, crumbs and detritus on the available table space of one empty seat. Place had about 20 people in it, about 4 or 5 of them appeared to be drinking coffee. My group of three walked out."
Starbucks,"this was the worst starbucks I have ever been, in all countries. Awful costumer service. one attendent just refuses to sell me a Ethiopia kayon saying that would be too much work and he wouldn't do that. and then told me that if I want to drink a starbucks premium coffee, I should go to other coffee specialized place... would never come back. and I saw them opening the restroom door with a woman insidem just because she was there for more than 10 minutes, that's a crime!"
Starbucks,"Always packed with tourists. Very slow. You're not popping in to grab a quick coffee here! Otherwise, friendly staff and all the normal Starbucks things."
Starbucks,Another nice Starbucks!
Starbucks,"Guy taking my order was great!  Guy calling out the drinks when they're done, sucked.  He did not call out my Name on the cup And he called out the wrong drink.  My Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino is not a Double Chocolaty Chip, which he called out when placing it on the counter."
Starbucks,"Charging 1$ for a glass of water from your customers is unacceptable, you should be ashamed of yourselves taking advantage of your customers like that. They also charged me extra for my regular black coffee. Place was extremely dirty as was the bathroom.. will not come to this branch ever again"
Starbucks,I ordered a Venti white chocolate Mocha and was given a grande. I was charged for a grande but the point is I wanted a Venti. I left right away because I needed to catch a bus back to my hotel. Then I took a sip of my drink and it didn't even taste like a white chocolate Mocha. Very disappointing.
Starbucks,"There are no tables or chairs in this branch, inconvenient for coffee"
Starbucks,"Nice little shop to grab coffee near the warf. The barista Desi is amazing!! She made my coffee just right!! If you ever stop here, ask for her, she's the best ever!!!"
Starbucks,Personally i dont like starbucks and have since stopped drinking their overpriced coffee due to their disrespectful attitude and the lack of consequences to the employees who continue in their actions against our LEO's. 😒 …
Starbucks,"Your average Starbucks. Nice employees, clean-ish, 1 bathroom, fairly busy most times, but you know what you're going to get when you order your favorite menu items."
Starbucks,"They didnt have Anything of what were tran to order saying that the machine was broken , it looked like they’re were just trying to sell what was easy to make like regular coffee….  👎🏼👎🏼 … not recommended …"
Starbucks,"A starbucks, all are the same."
Starbucks,"It's a high throughput Starbucks in a heavy tourist area... Service is ""fine"", they could use a more effective layout given the traffic volume, and perhaps a more rigorous cleaning routine."
Starbucks,"Cashier Catherine has bad attitude , tables and floor needs some attention garbage all over"
Starbucks,"It's actually pretty much like any other Starbucks that you'll find around, but because this is located right by the trolley stop, it makes this outlet rather popular. But it's no big deal if you ask me, it's just another Starbucks that's not more impressive than the next."
Starbucks,It's my first time at this place I get in at 8:45 pm at 8:55 pm manager was putting al chairs up and telling costumers to get out cuz it close at 9:00 pm in a really rude way  didn't listen cuz according to the web they close at 10 and I tell him that they need to update they web cuz the difference of time and he just say in a rude way again that the schedule was on the door
Starbucks,Its quite a big coffee shop. Has good amount of seats to relax and have a coffee. 3 stars because only 3 people works at this shop and when crowded you end up waiting for 20-30 mins to have your coffee.
Starbucks,"Been here three times. Each time I receive extremely slow service and every time they forget the almond milk which I paid for. When I ask politely for them to add some, I get a rude look."
Starbucks,Food and drink was good but workers don't acknowledge you at all so walk up to counter and speak up if your picking up your order.
Starbucks,"Typical city Starbucks, a little bit dirty (don't mention the toilets), but with fast service. I'm giving props to the cashiers who have to deal with tourists every single day that either don't know how to order or don't speak English. Talking about language barriers.  Verstehen Sie Deutsch?"
Starbucks,Horrible customer service.
Starbucks,"This location has closed all it’s outlets so you can’t charge. Head three blocks down to 901 Columbus caffe. Ample outlets, bathroom and great staff."
Starbucks,"Just like all the Starbucks in San Francisco. However,  it's not the most clean one. Food crumbs on the table. Flies fly around. But they serve your drink in a fast and friendly way."
Starbucks,"Dirty, mediocre service"
Starbucks,"Great location, cappuccino & lemon cake a must for breakfast. A little stop after a city walk is mandatory, relax, good coffee and nice staff."
Starbucks,The young lady that helped me was patient and informative. My coffee was hot and strong. These tbings assisted me in beginning a wonderful day!
Starbucks,"Just another starbucks. Good place to hang out. Enough seating available. Mobile ordering is very handy, so that it is available by the time I reach the cafe."
Starbucks,"No bathroom, no caps takes em 10 mins to make a drink while it’s not busy. Just bad experience"
Starbucks,Just your classic starbucks. Quick and friendly service was provided as per usual for starbucks. I had the guava iced tea and it was very good.
Starbucks,Waited more than 10-15 mins for a mocha and they gave a wrong coffee!!
Starbucks,Asked about availability of their travelers coffee 96oz purchase. Will get it for next group meeting.
Starbucks,Never actually got to go here.  Their hours of operations are the worst.
Starbucks,Rund down Starbucks. Toilets are a mess due to the cable car stop. Therfore loads of tourists queuing for the restrooms. Intetieur needs some love.
Starbucks,"had almost no syrups, didn’t make drinks right, staff had poor listening skills"
Starbucks,One employee seems to be the bully of the bunch and creates a negative vibe. Just walk two blocks down and you will get the usual smiles you are used to.
Starbucks,Nice 👍 yet managers do all the work and employees are so slow it took 15 min for drip coffee and two people in line ...lame and 😴..tourists also make it freaky  And bathroom is a health code issue

Starbucks,"Quick and friendly service, however the restaurant could use a good cleaning."
Starbucks,So thankful that they have a clean restroom and a friendly staff

Starbucks,get citi cup :)
Starbucks,"Not the friendliest baristas, but the chicken and artichoke sandwich was good, while the place wasn’t too busy."
Starbucks,"No tables to sit, no restrooms available."
Starbucks,Baristas are hostile about refills and ignorant of company policy. They insisted on refilling a hot beverage cup with iced coffee.
Starbucks,the selection of sweets and cake at this store is very poor! only 10min down the road the Starbucks has delicious chocolate and lemon cake.
Starbucks,Good location near the hotels. Friendly staff. Service can take an extra few minutes.
Starbucks,"Dirty, disengaged staff and pricy. You can do definitely better than that. For a ""breakfast"" on the go only."
Starbucks,Great customer service clean and didn’t have to wait long. Great place
Starbucks,I don't need to visit to know their coffee is bad because they are all the same and they don't know how to make coffee. I wish they would stop coming up when I search for coffee roasters.

But I still tried my luck since I paid for the drinks and knocked on the door as the same attendant was there, she totally ignored me and shook her head as a firm *No*. I felt let down."
Starbucks,Love Starbucks
Starbucks,Good
Starbucks,Good
Starbucks,"Worst Starbucks I've ever been to. With the quality of coffee, with service - everything is at the height of corporate standards ... But you can only drink coffee standing up. I was the only one drinking coffee inside. Everything is taken away, and on business. No one makes appointments here, no one comes to sit... I think explanations are superfluous..."
Starbucks,"Next to the cable car station, it's easy to find no internal seats, buy it and take it away!"
Starbucks,Pretty ugly Starbucks. No seating. Disks extremely dirty. Loveless cash cow at a cable car hotspot. This can be done better…
Starbucks,almost no products There are only stand seats for security reasons The quality of the clerk is star ⭐️ 5
Starbucks,No chairs and too weak Wi-Fi!!
Starbucks,"I have never been to a sao bad Starbucks. Only sales, then you have to go out again because there are no more tables in there. The service staff is very unfriendly. The guy who made our coffee didn't even look at us when we asked. Really rude. Paper on the toilet was already empty at 10am and therefore no one seems to have cleaned it. But the staff didn't really care. Awkward!"
Starbucks,"Dirty. Dirty and abandoned. Dust on the glass of the pastry and croissant counter. Dirty tables that we don't even clean if the previous user leaves. We have lived with a gnawed sandwich and an empty pot of coffee. Photo attached. The place is not full, so why are they dedicated to it."
Starbucks,"Many things to change! Very slow and listless staff, place without seating tables and I would also say not very clean. I'm surprised some Starbucks manager hasn't stopped by already!"
Starbucks,A starbucks like the others. Super free wifi with a lot of speed. Tables a bit dirty and sticky

Starbucks,"One more store in this chain, in this case very close to Fisherman's Wharf and one of the beginnings of the cable car, the classic San Francisco tram. Being a bit ""hidden"" (since it is not on the main tourist streets) it is usually crowded but you can find a place to sit."
