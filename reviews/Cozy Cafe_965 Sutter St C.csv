Cozy Cafe,"The wife found this place on Google maps....so glad she did. The service was exceptionally great, fast, and satisfying. 3 Beautifully Spirited Ladies running the place, and very accommodating. Food came to our table hot and ready to eat. Simply Delicious. Other customers coming in were obviously previous customers, very relaxing (cozy), in and out in minutes. A true taste of San Francisco (in my opinion)"
Cozy Cafe,"Great, simple, clean cafe and breakfast restaurant.  This is one of the few places post-pandemic that relies on providing good value for money and serving more customers rather than simply jacking up prices and hoping for the best.  I like the values they stand for, and their breakfast sandwiches:)."
Cozy Cafe,Great neighborhood place to eat in or take out. For me it's perfect for grabbing  homemade type sandwiches on my way to work or on a tight schedule and need something fast and inexpensive.
Cozy Cafe,"The french toast here is great, its not usually crowded, and the prices are half of any other breakfast place in sfo."
Cozy Cafe,"Simple, but very tasty breakfast options available: from bagel, cheese sandwich to pancakes or muffins. Staff is great and extremely friendly. Prices are fair. If you want some good food for a good price served by friendly staff - we can highly recommend this place. A lot of locals come around for their daily breakfast/snack routine."
Cozy Cafe,I have a Egg avocado tomato bagel and it's delicious..with Cafe Au Lai!!!
Cozy Cafe,this is a very nice cafe for breakfast with fair prices and delicious food
Cozy Cafe,"Tried the California bagel, with extra sunny side egg and a side of 3 pancakes. Yummy!"

Cozy Cafe,Incredibly nice staff & great service. Very affordable food & drinks. Great hidden spot right in downtown! Perfect for a quick breakfast/lunch or cheap coffee. There is inside & outside seating & to-go options as well. They will definitely cater to your preferences as possible. :) two very nice women running this joint!!!! Love to see it
Cozy Cafe,"Tiny itty bitty place, very friendly ladies running it.  Great place to grab a quick bite!"
Cozy Cafe,Amazing California bagel. Latte is okay. Great place overall 👍 …
Cozy Cafe,"Foods OK, bagel with egg and cheese for $4.25. About the same as I pay at Starbucks. Rushed, cramped, as friendly as a McDonald’s. It will do, but not much more than that."
Cozy Cafe,Very tasty! The best place ih this area
Cozy Cafe,The ladies here always know my order whether I call ahead or order in person. They make a great BLT or breakfast sandwhich. Great for a quick bite.
Cozy Cafe,"I highly recommend the Cozy Cafe! Wide selection of breakfasts, very delicious and the staff is very kind😊 …"
Cozy Cafe,We ate here almost everyday during our honeymoon. The girls behind the counter are so friendly and the food is absolutely delicious! We recommend the French toast and the San Francisco bagle! The OJ and the coffee are pretty amazing and the prices are very reasonable too!
Cozy Cafe,"Wouldn't ever want to have breakfast here again. Eggs and pancakes are low grade, and the price is no different than the cafe further down the block that serves at a much higher quality. The eggs are served from a container, which is why you only get the scrambled option. You clearly see them microwave most of their menu. NOT HOME COOKED, just cheap instant packaged produce"
Cozy Cafe,"Great place, great food, great staff, and good prices.  This is my new FAV breakfast spot."
Cozy Cafe,We stayes across the road in Vertigo Hotel and they dont do breakfast they recommended Cosy Cafe and it waa our go to place for Breakfast. The ladys are lovely and food is simple but great. Only place we found decent coffee whilst in USA. Highly recommend.
Cozy Cafe,"Great little place for breakfast, wanted something a little cheaper as didn't have breakfast included with our hotel. Tasty eggs and pancakes and coffee. Highly recommended."
Cozy Cafe,"My wife and I are here 4 days in a row on our honeymoon. The breakfast sandwiches are to die for (try the California). The ladies that run it are super nice, and I couldn't have asked for more."
Cozy Cafe,"Not sure who/why anyone gives this a low review (or why there are so many honeymoon reviews), but this place is very good. Local place with local customers, very good, freshly made sandwiches, friendly service. A gem!"
Cozy Cafe,Food very good. My english muffin was lovely and hot and the coffee was superb.much better than the other wishy washy stuff ive experienced so far on our trip to the usa.
Cozy Cafe,Delicious!!! Hands down the best breakfast with quick and easy service. And the iced coffee will be in my dreams forever
Cozy Cafe,"Love love love Cosy cafe. From the great staff to the food to the sheer ambience of the surroundings, you just can't beat it. First day there was at the cafe when two police officers came if with a ukelele to serenade the gorgeous girls behind the counter. To me Cosy Cafe is everything I wanted the Haight district to be - super friendly, relaxed, everybody chilling on their own vibe but all together and all relaxed. Unlike much of the Haight I think they've managed to recreate the sixties culture without trying hard at all - they're not trying to be cool, they just are. And the coffee is to die for."
Cozy Cafe,These Sisters serve up the best breakfast! Wash it down with a green tea smoothie and youll return the nextday to get your #2sisters bagel on!.....a cozy place for 2.

Cozy Cafe,To have a real American breakfast without all the tourists who flock to the same places. Fresh food and all freshly prepared. The prices are the best in the area and for the quality of the service offered there is no comparison. To make us breakfast every morning!
