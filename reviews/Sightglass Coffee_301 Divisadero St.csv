Sightglass Coffee,"Indie local coffee shop with a variety of coffees and teas, plus a reasonable selection of baked goods. Has a sleek and welcoming ambience with lots of interior seating, including wooden booths. I love the cool record collection behind the counter. Inclusive space for all genders."
Sightglass Coffee,Sightglass is my go-to coffee brand in SF☕️ They make and serve the best quality of coffee. Sightglass at Divisadero st. is kind of small space compared with its headquarter in SoMa.
Sightglass Coffee,Beautiful space and good coffee. Kinda over priced coffee in my opinion (like it’s good but still just taste like coffee) and very disappointing they don’t have Wi-Fi!
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee & nice people. I recommend it. 👌  It is in San Franciso. Off of Page & busy Divisadero street; so it's best to walk, ride your bike, take the bus or ect. Parking can be tight at times, like most places in the city."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is one of my absolute favorite coffee roasters. Easily one of the best coffee shops in San Francisco, and arguably beyond that. Your caffeine intake doesn’t need to be perfunctory. You can enjoy it too. Go ahead, you deserve it probably."
Sightglass Coffee,"Ordered a cappuccino, aroma was on the citrusy side. I like the high ceilings and the large tables. Chairs not comfy though. Also the staff were not as friendly compared to other roasters in the city."
Sightglass Coffee,"Drinks are decent. Pretty balanced, not too strong. Food is small fare, and a bit fancy and expensive for what it is but ok. Puzzles me a bit why startup and VC types like it here (and the main location). Music can be a bit loud and distracting and there's no wifi. Plus, the table are a bit quirky and very inefficiently laid out. I guess it forces unintended interactions which some people look for. Not sure. Anyway it is what it is."
Sightglass Coffee,"Love the coffee and the interior of this place. They also have good chocolate chip cookies! Recommended if you need a place for a causal meet up or work space. Not too much room, but if you get a seat it’s great. Trade off is that it’s expensive."
Sightglass Coffee,"Ordered the ""Coffee of the Day"" and a Mocha. The coffee of the day was good.. $4 for a black coffee is a little pricey. The mocha I wasn't a fan of - it was a bit oily and lacked a good chocolate flavor. Also, parking was a little challenging to find, so if you're not from the neighborhood be mindful of this. Overall, decent option, but not my favorite."
Sightglass Coffee,"Excellent coffee and pastries. I also love their cascara shrub soda. Great atmosphere to chill and read, it can get busy in the mornings but is never as frenetic as other coffee shops. Their toilets are always clean and they play great music too!"
Sightglass Coffee,"We stumbled here because of a disappointing visit to Wholesome Bakery.  But good that we did...  Great music, cool customer service, nice environment and lots of delicious options. I recommend the vegan spiced chocolate donut.  Oh and damn good coffee...  Way to go!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Very nice staff and a really nice find on the edge of the panhandle.  The coffee machines look like Lamborghinis with a cool lightning type sign.    They didn't rush us and the coffee was good although little acidic (I had Ethiopian special brew). But the lead staff was really nice and gave me her special agave because I couldn't find any honey for the coffee to balance the acidity.  Would definitely come again.  Good place to work, relax, or read."
Sightglass Coffee,"Slow service and mediocre coffee. I got myself a macchiato, and it was alright but I’d never order it again from this place. Pastries look fantastic though"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great new Sightglass location! The interior is very well done and the drinks are very high quality. It does get crowded at times, finding a place to sit might be a bit difficult. Still, this place is great!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Double espresso tasted extremely sour. Some people like it like that, I would appreciate being able to choose the beans. Carbonated water that comes with espresso extremely chlorinated - undrinkable. As I wanted to inquire about the coffee beans, was brushed aside. Giving this one a miss from now on."
Sightglass Coffee,One of the better coffee places in town. I like their lattes and they serve in ceramic if you stay.
Sightglass Coffee,"latte ($6.50) tasted fine, seats were uncomfortable, no wifi or plugs for laptops, packed on Sundays. Not sure how these places get good ratings"
Sightglass Coffee,"After a year of patiently waiting, finally this location has opened, and it's as amazing as you'd expect. Sightglass has created an excellent brand and has created some of the best coffee shops in SF."
Sightglass Coffee,One star for the atmosphere. The servers are apathetic and dressed like grunge models. The coffee is truly awful and very expensive.
Sightglass Coffee,My boyfriend and I both got iced lattes and they were really delicious! Great customer service and nice ambiance too.
Sightglass Coffee,To be honest the espresso was bad maybe they didn’t calibrate it very well at that time and it was over roasted coffee as well ( medium-dark ) roast. Only good thing the pour over coffee ( Kenyan ) the pastries are really good.
Sightglass Coffee,This is a great environment to hang out in. The ambiance is great the staff is friendly and there is a decent amount of seating here. I'm not a coffee drinker but my friend said the coffee is great. I had the hot chocolate and all I can say is get the coffee haha.
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee! Ok and a bit slow service. Still worth a visit.
Sightglass Coffee,Popular coffee shop Love their interdeco
Sightglass Coffee,"It's overpriced in my opinion, but they did a great job with the layout and decor. They also gave baked goods from a couple of local bakeries that compliment their coffee nicely. Bring a newspaper or some friends when you come."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nowhere near the consistency, quality, and care that once was and we've been coming to Sightglass for 5 years and this location since it opened. So far the issues seem particular to the Divisidaro location, but over the last 2-3 months, there has been a significant drop in attention to detail here. Every component of their expensive cappuccino has been worse than nearby Ritual and others."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of most famous coffee brand in San Francisco, and more branches now. The whole space deco is chic, and coffee is fine."
Sightglass Coffee,There are two lines. One that runs along divisadero to order and one that wraps around the corner to wait for your order to be ready. Pastries are fresh and espresso is good
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee in the neighborhood, with warm staff and a beautiful interior. Unfortunately, there is now a vagabond who is usually high that aggressively harasses customers outside making the environment at times unsafe. The well-intentioned staff are kind and welcoming to her, but unfortunately not making her responsible for her actions of hostility creates a negative experience for others."
Sightglass Coffee,"Delicious coffee. They prepare their pour overs in Hario V60s and the Baristas really know what they're doing and are happy to discuss brew ratios and extraction times with you. Proper coffee nerds.  They serve espresso shots with a small glass of sparking water to help clear the pallet, that's a nice touch. The icing on the cake was their vinyl collection playing over a vintage set of Bose 901's, through a McIntosh amp.  I wish I lived next door to this place."
Sightglass Coffee,Everyone who works here is really nice and they have the best coffee. The breakfast options are rough though if you don’t want a pastry - ordered the yogurt with granola today to eat the yogurt and both parts were so packed with sugar I felt immediately nauseated and then my GCM showed my blood sugar spike like I just ate a funnel cake. The “superfood” packs are also a ton of sugar. They really should really use real yogurt or just some something not so awful.
Sightglass Coffee,"Morning light pours in through Sightglass, brightening and enlivening the morning like the coffee itself."
Sightglass Coffee,"I’m a student that just wants to find a nice place to work and sip coffee. Nice vibe inside, coffee is decent, but they don’t have Wifi. Too many coffee shops in sf are unfriendly to students and remote workers by not offering wifi, this has been a frustrating process as someone who doesn’t work well at home."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great environment, moderately crowded, and smooth coffee. If you like you're coffee the same way as a garden variety hipster then this place is for you."
Sightglass Coffee,Some of the best coffee in the city. Never made a bad drink.
Sightglass Coffee,"Had this spot on my list to try while I was in town visiting from Seattle (and a self-described coffee elitist). I was truly blown away. This might have been the most perfect tasting latte I've ever had. (I had it with a splash of vanilla for the record). So balanced, rich yet smooth.  The pastries also were incredible; the pistachio (with some type of cranberry or other berry in it as well?) in particular had me drooling. Thoroughly impressed with this place. The staff was patient and kind with our large order and we managed to share a large table with one other patron, as they have seating but it's a popular spot. There was a line when we arrived but it moved quickly. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in SF and also crossing my fingers they expand to the PNW and open one in Seattle someday!"
Sightglass Coffee,"It is simply one of the best and my favorites coffee shop in town. Overall, it’s a good shop for studying and relaxing. Highly recommended!"
Sightglass Coffee,This Place is Nice & Worth It. I Recommend Locals & Trues. ☆
Sightglass Coffee,Their single origin pour overs are exceptional! Highly recommend.
Sightglass Coffee,"You know what, when I hear Sightglass Coffee and I am started feeling and smelling awesome coffee. May be you feel I am weird but ask coffee lovers about it. As a coffee lover, this place is one of the great in San Francisco. I love their blend, its so good. Apart from coffee, their menu is decent enough and reasonable price. The staffs are very welcoming and I love the vibe here. This is the best place to increase your energy, you know what I mean."
Sightglass Coffee,"Really great coffee, great croissants, and cool tunes from huge vinyl collection. Vibrant, but relaxed atmosphere. Can't be beat!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great oat cappuccino, modern interior, clean toilets, good service. No Wi-Fi."
Sightglass Coffee,"Stylish interior, great baristas and coffee, stellar baked goods. Seriously maybe the best croissant I've ever had. This place just feels right. Hang out for a bit and listen to the staff pick some vinyl to play."
Sightglass Coffee,Like the interior and the huge table. Lovely cafe to grab a good coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"The quick cup coffee is reliably good—I like bold without bitter. If you’re not a sweet, flavored coffee fan (I’m not) the vanilla latte is subtle and surprisingly good."
Sightglass Coffee,"I’m a regular at this place. the service is always chill or excellent, the interior is nicely designed, the music choices are good every time, and I always enjoy the coffee here.  head’s up there’s no wifi so it’s more of a relax place."
Sightglass Coffee,Cute coffee shop. I was a bit disappointed that at 3pm they were sold out if all food. Seems poorly managed.  My vanilla cold brew drink was pretty good. Not what I expected but ok.  I enjoyed the seating. Open seating that is conducive to sharing. Lots of people working on their laptops. Lots of open air space. Good music in the background.
Sightglass Coffee,"Probably one of the most beautifully designed interiors in the Bay Area coffee scene, this particular Sightglass is a great experience both in its excellent espresso and the space in which you enjoy it. I'm curious who designed it?  The coffee is always pretty excellent, and the service is jovial and quick.  My only reservation is in the lack of turnover for its seating, I'v been 4 times in the last year and there was no place to sit for 2 people to have a conversation. Might need some more seating or a scheme to keep people moving and not glued to their laptops the whole time. Maybe call up the architect to retrofit an espresso counter to stand/sit at?"
Sightglass Coffee,"I enjoy coffee. It keeps me going and I also enjoy the convenience of walking around the corner to enjoy delicious coffee. If you're in the nopa Alamo sq neighborhood, then I highly suggest giving this cafe a try. If coffee doesn't entice you enough then perhaps come by on the weekends to enjoy a slice of pie with your coffee!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is good! A bit overpriced, but strong and tasty. Some of the baristas have no professional or interpersonal skills... I have been treated with a smile one day and quite rudely on another. The rudely part turned me off, and it was a while before I returned. There is a sweet little bakery, Wholesome Cafe, across the street that sells delicious gluten-free pastries and Four Barrel Coffee that I personally recommend more. All the best on your coffee adventures!"
Sightglass Coffee,Sightglass always has great espresso and good drip coffee. It's all light roasts but that's a personal choice. Good spot for a lazy Sunday morning or they have a sidewalk window to order from the street. Good selection of pastries too.  Come here for a good coffee and a relaxed atmosphere.
Sightglass Coffee,$6 for a thimble of bad cold brew. Pretty embarrassing
Sightglass Coffee,"W🥐W! This place is beautiful, not in an artsy cluttered way, beautiful in an industrialesk kind of way. The tile, wood and design are the attractor!!! Actually had my sights set on a coffee shop across the street but they were closed so I ended up in here, I love the synchronicity, this is a fantastic place, comfortable ambience, good music, really clean, kind friendly people behind the counter, a big sunrise window. The coffee is made with intention and care and the pastries are fresh and flaky 😋If you’re in the area you’ll want to hit Sight Glass!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great service and great interior, great place to hang out or get some work done. The coffee is pretty good, it’s not as deep and bright as blue bottle coffee, there is more water then coffee ratio to my liking. As a place to hangout and study, 5 star. Coffee is 4 star"
Sightglass Coffee,Nice coffee shop with a small selection of pastries from local bakeries (it was after noon so maybe they have more in the morning?). Space was limited but lots of laptop people around. Had almond milk as a dairy alternative and it was decently made.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee. I tried espresso, Americano, cold filter (hot brewed), pour over, and quick drip between two visits. The bean flavor stood out as especially roasted to my taste on all the origins and blends that I tried. Maybe a medium roast (Full City-ish). So good to see shops pulling back from the very light roasts of the last wave of specialty coffee. The cold coffee was maybe my favorite but the quick drip and pour over were also excellent. So well done. Plenty of complexity and depth with no bitterness. Smooth and flavorful! I had mixed results on the espresso. My first visit I had an espresso that was deep and complex. A brisk, bold shot in the mouth but with a highly varied aftertaste that made it an adventure. My second visit I had an Americano, different barista, and the espresso flavor was not complex with no sweetness that I could detect. It tasted too dark and I would have preferred a lighter roast bean in this case. Also no single origin was offered for espresso, which would be an easy build. The interior is beautiful, including bathrooms! Lots of community seating (shared) in a minimalist but warm and homey setting. Very nice place to spend time. This is a gem for sure. Maybe my favorite overall coffee spot, although not for espresso."
Sightglass Coffee,I had their iced coffee and it was very tasty. Very busy with a line out the door so be prepared for a wait and they do require a mask so if you're going inside don't forget it. Very friendly staff too. I will say they know how to hustle!
Sightglass Coffee,"This shop is one of my favorites in the country. Sightglass coffee is exceptionally good, and the staff here is great. Compared to other shops with combined roasting/packing operation, the design stands out for how combined yet pleasing a space it is."
Sightglass Coffee,"Extremely charming place in a nice part of town. The atmosphere is great, and is befitting of a true San Francisco coffee shop. My wife and I stopped here on our way to Ashbury Heights. Well worth the slight detour."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee and atmosphere. Pastries are good as well. The interior is cozy, perfect to read books or catch up on something. It’s a bit busy on weekends but not that crazy compare to other locations."
Sightglass Coffee,"This is my place to go when I have a lot of work to do, want some good food, or both. There is a really nice atmosphere for work, beautifully minimalistic decor, and good music. If you are willing to spend a bit more on your coffee and pastry, this is a very good place to do it."
Sightglass Coffee,"From the Sun sipping coffee in the entryway, to the carefully placed individual tiles in the floor...this place is a sanctuary. The baristas are nice and welcoming and know their stuff.  They make a great non- bitter Cap. Delicious! We stop here when we walk Divis. Thanks for being so terrific!"
Sightglass Coffee,the mocha is very bitter and the espresso is ok but the coffee beans used for espresso should be different.. I personally find  spending $20 for not good coffee and 2 normal croissants excruciatingly painful. Also the crowd to be found here is not a friendly bunch.
Sightglass Coffee,"So expensive and slow. Seating is mostly large tables with one person taking it all with a laptop.  $3.75 for a tiny cup of coffee is ridiculous! Plus it's not even good, not compared to the others nearby. I would suggest you try one of the nearby coffee shops instead such as the Mill (excellent coffee and food), Bean bag, Vinyl, or Peets, or matching half."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice and spacious coffee place. And of course, very good coffee!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, great wooden tables to work on and great vibe. There are no outlets or WiFi though which is why I took away one star."
Sightglass Coffee,"Cool vibe, nice people. Great spot to meet up with a friend. $5ish latte."
Sightglass Coffee,Try the pistachio croissant
Sightglass Coffee,One of my favorite local coffee shops - excellent coffee and quality baked goods. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming and clearly know their repeat customers well.
Sightglass Coffee,"Specious coffee shop with good coffee. But no wifi, so no go for me."
Sightglass Coffee,"Not only does this place serve outstanding coffee with excellent service, but it does it in style. Pop in for a joe and check out the thoughtfully designed space. Seems like everything in here was well thought out from the mosaic tile floors, wooden benches and tables, to the stone counter tops."
Sightglass Coffee,The service was very good  The drinks (nitro cold brew coffee) was very good  The atmosphere was very good
Sightglass Coffee,"Not good coffee or espresso...very overrated! They can't even warm up a pastry. They said that ""it's supposed to be served room temp"" ...Hahaha..lol. As you can see, the customer service is also lacking, as per SF par. And on top of it all, it's way too much money. Oh yeah, no internet or power plugs for customers. Solid never again..."
Sightglass Coffee,Newest location and it does not disappoint! Ample seating as well.
Sightglass Coffee,"Verges a bit into the realm of coffee snobbery. They only serve coffee,  no tea. They occasionally act very reluctantly when you ask for something in a certain way (e.g. if you want your iced coffee in a to go cup with a lid, which is just dumb that it's not standard). I wish they served iced tea or a non-nitro iced coffee. Also the service in the morning is a bit slower compared to some.other neighborhood spots. Not an easy place to grab and go on the way to work unless you want their hot quick cup option."
Sightglass Coffee,"I come for the music, good coffee, deliberate lack of internet, interior, thoughtful bohemian service.  I love their beans - specifically Colombian and Guatemalan - excellent quality - best in City."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nicely designed, modern cafe. Great strong coffee. Not many comfortable seating places, noisy, not a good place to spend time working or sharing quiet conversations."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, but prices are high compared to The Mill, Matching Half, and other places nearby. The staff was friendly and the space is nice, so overall a good addition to the Sightglass brand."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of the better local coffee shops. Space is pleasant, with plenty of seating, and their espresso drinks and pour over are both good to great."
Sightglass Coffee,Good coffee and pastries.  Small portions though. No WiFi or power receptacles available.
Sightglass Coffee,Very good coffee (though it's a bit expensive) and a good space with a lot of daylight. Not too many seats (maybe about 15?) but people cycle through pretty quickly.
Sightglass Coffee,If you're looking for excellent coffee and a nice ambience out of the 20s this is the place. You can get away with working here (though there's no wifi) and most people tend to be meeting friends or reading a book.
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is good! This neighborhood coffee bar is housed within a beautiful corner Victorian on Divisadero and Page Street. Originally built in 1903, this space is a community hub; a place for enjoying delicious coffees, meeting friends, or taking a quiet moment during a busy day. Espresso bar, pour-over selection and cold drinks on tap all highlight outstanding coffees sourced, roasted and brewed with the utmost care and commitment."
Sightglass Coffee,"Self service wannabe posh-caffeteria, where espresso (which was actually perfect for American standard) is luke-warm before you walk to the counter to pick it up. You need to clean after yourself as well. Staff has energy and communication skills like an office plant."
Sightglass Coffee,"I am very particular when it comes to coffee/espresso. These folks do it right, I consider them a part of SF's upper echelon of good coffee!"
Sightglass Coffee,Good coffee and great atmosphere.
Sightglass Coffee,"Too quiet. I see vinyl on the shelves but there's no music here. The coffee is good, and the interior is pretty. The place lacks energy, though."
Sightglass Coffee,"Got a coffee and a chocolate raspberry scone to go. Both were tasty and the staff was friendly, which I always appreciate since not all specialty coffee places have nice staff. Will come back."
Sightglass Coffee,"Order their uji matcha latte was dissapointed, tasted like plain milk. However their drip coffee was good."
Sightglass Coffee,One of the best caps in town. This location is also super fast!
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is good and the environment is full of design feels, must have: MacBook and your indie design book. I’ll probably suggest this place to a friend with minimal style!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee shop in San Francisco. Fabulous coffee, truly great. A cut above."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and there is always seating available! The pour over menu changes regularly so it's a nice way to try new coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"Never really enjoyed sight glass coffee, they pale in comparison to peers Blue Bottle, Philz and Four Barrel. Maybe it's not my cup of coffee, three stars are for ambience and location.  Oh, and no Internet here"
Sightglass Coffee,Lovely cafe with a wide variety of coffee. Prices are very reasonable and the crowds are mainly local. There’s also a little water station in the middle of the cafe. Stay hydrated!
Sightglass Coffee,Really lovely venue and tasty coffee drinks. Enjoyed our visit.
Sightglass Coffee,Order your coffee to stay in one of their clay mugs. Eat chocolate raspberry scones. Stare at the absolutely gorgeous floor tiles. Go early. It's sublime.
Sightglass Coffee,Coffee is amazing and the pastries are great!  This is my place to go to read a book and relax
Sightglass Coffee,"This is how my experience unfolded: Can I have a 3 shot 12oz Americano with room please.  Yes, except you can have 2 or 4 shots, not 3. Ok, I will have 2 shots.  Also, you can only have 8 or 10 oz, not 12. Ok, I will have 10 oz, which ended up being an 8 oz with room  Excuse me, do you have some cream? Yes, we do, but you have to ask for it.  May I have some cream, please! Wow... Seems like a lot of effort to get a cup of coffee, which made me forget how the coffee actually tasted."
Sightglass Coffee,Tasty treats from a variety of local bakeries. Excellent cold-brewed vanilla coffee.  No tea.  Nice communal places to sit.
Sightglass Coffee,"Inconsistent service. When I entered Sightglass on Divisadero the service was like nothing I have ever experienced at Sightglass before. The workers were huddled over away from the register, concerned only with what ever banter they were sharing and with no interest in providing that smooth, seamless, passionate service I have always loved Sightglass for.  Finally, I ordered the macchiato.  Moments later they called my name and I approached the ready station to grab my tiny drink. When I got there I asked for a small side of spritzer water. The server pulls out a large bottle and pours a bit into a small glass, ""all is well"", I am thinking. But then as she passes me the small glass of spritzer water she says ""just so you know, we sell whole bottles of spritzer water at the counter, we only give sides with espresso shots. Keep that in mind for next time"". This is where the whole experience truly falls apart. I have been to Sightglass on Folsom st hundreds of times and never have I been told that a side of spritzer is not avail for macchiatos... so as you can imagine I was confused. I expressed to the blonde haired lady server ""you do realize a macchiato is in fact an expresso shot with just a smidgen of steamed milk, right?"" I also expressed to her that ""at no other Sightglass have I not excitedly been provided a side spritzer water with my macchiato"", she goes on to ask ""are you sure?"" I reply said.. ""not ever"". She went on to say some hoopla about she ""... would look into it"" and blah blah, at that point I was out.  Bottom line is consistency is everything. Very few understand that the highest level macchiato experience is accompanied with a side of spritzer water... the funny thing is I learned this fact from Sightglass themselves. So, why allow your principles to fall apart now Sightglass? It would seem based on my today's experience that during Sightglass's recent expansion efforts quality, consistency and that all around ""Dopeness"" are beginning to become their lost art. Sad times.  I can only hope that a review like this wake Sightglass up and get Sightglass back to whom they once were... so that my next hundred macchiatos will be as good as my first. Cheers. -Bey"
Sightglass Coffee,"Pricey, but good coffee, friendly baristas and clean bathroom. 👍 …"
Sightglass Coffee,I think it's the best coffee shop in San Francisco. The baristas are very warm and professional. The coffee is really great ！☕️☕️☕️
Sightglass Coffee,Cool large open space though a bit loud. Great coffee though you'll pay for it. Pastry selection is dangerous for the midline.

Sightglass Coffee,"Nice decor, trendy place with good coffee. Try the Apple Pastry, its delicious! Service is fast and friendly"

Sightglass Coffee,"I ordered a pour-over and the cascara shrub. The filter was made with a coffee from Kenya. We took the liberty of asking for information on the coffee used, in particular his region, the barista did not know but did not look any further. He told us that ""maybe"" information was on the package. Too bad for a specialty coffee shop. And the cascara shrub didn't taste like cascara, it just smelled like vinegar."
Sightglass Coffee,"I've been here because it's famous as a local cafe, but it's acidic and tasted like water, so it's not so good... There's no Wi-Fi. The atmosphere is hip. Coffee is sour and watery. Soso:( No wifi. Hipster Vibes."
