Souvenir Coffee,"Cute narrow little coffee shop with a fun ambience. Lots of coffee options and a few other drink options. They also have snacks like fancy pastries/breads, including a fabulous looking marshmallow bread. My oat chai latte was unfortunately a bit disappointing compared to those I've had elsewhere. This place has a really nice interior with high ceilings, what looks like reclaimed wood and bricks, and industrial style flooring. There's minimal seating: only a few stools by the window, plus a few more stools near the back where the drinks are being prepared, so this isn't a great place to meet a friend or hang out for a while indoors. Since the place is so small, everyone would likely be able to overhear your conversation. There is some seating outdoors in a small fenced parklet area."
Souvenir Coffee,small place but decent coffee! would recommend 🫶🏻
Souvenir Coffee,"Such a fabulous, oat latte to go. Tastes smooth and creamy. I love this spot."
Souvenir Coffee,Iced Vietnamese coffee! Looks like too much ice but it's the right amount! Nice flavor! Good service!
Souvenir Coffee,"Lovely little coffee shop. I got a matcha and loved it, the taste was light and sweet. Service is great. They have a small selection of pastries, the muffin I had was great also"
Souvenir Coffee,"Super cosy cafe! Great menu, I ordered the Autumn harvest which is their fall season coffee drink. It was perfect for my mood 👌"
Souvenir Coffee,"Chai was just ok. But the reason for the rating is the person at the counter, couldn’t answer my simple question, ‘Is the chai really sweet?’ He just kept saying it’s ginger spice (needs more ginger and spices). Great, but you’re not listening to my question. I had to ask several times and finally my friend was like does it have sugar. I would give it another try (maybe), but I will not be ordering the chai and hopefully I don’t have the same person behind the counter helping me."
Souvenir Coffee,I had a good coffee and a nice quiche. Good service too!
Souvenir Coffee,Best coffee so far in San Francisco! 🥰 …
Souvenir Coffee,Cute little coffee shop with not a lot of seating but the drinks are okay (wasn't a fan of my chai latte). The service is really nice and they let us sit inside and use our laptops so that was really nice but overall wasn't a huge fan of the drinks and felt like it was a bit small for somewhere I might visit on a more frequent basis. Cute ambiance though on the inside and cool concept.
Souvenir Coffee,am so excited. A new coffeeshop. When was the last time that happened when everything seems to be closing these days? it's their Divisadero new location (originated from Berkeley). Poured straight into the cup. Very nice roast with lots of body and character. I wonder what would come out of these beans using a bottomless portafilter? long live Souvenir Coffee
Souvenir Coffee,A very cute coffee place in SF. The coffee is good and you get coffee by the pound as well. This place is better for a togo
Souvenir Coffee,"great coffee! I don’t have a ton of knowledge about different types of coffee and since it was a quiet morning when I went, the barista gave my boyfriend and I a ton of info about the different types of drinks (caffeine level, proportion of milk, etc). I went for a quick cup and left with a greater appreciation for coffee :) a new neighborhood staple for me"
Souvenir Coffee,I've been going here on a weekly basis for the last few months now. This store stood out quickly due to the fact that you can get a large espresso beverage (instead of just one size like some of the other coffee shops in the area??). The staff are very friendly and their great customer service and coffee kept me coming back.  The large bottles of cold brew are great for working from home and the pastries are good too. Highly recommend trying this place!
Souvenir Coffee,"Flat white was great. The shop itself is small and the barista is really nice. They also let my dog step inside, which is always appreciated. There is some seating outside, but in the morning it’s shaded and usually a bit windy, so be prepared."
Souvenir Coffee,"Awesome tiny lil Coffeeshop. Good prices, services and coffee"
Souvenir Coffee,Best coffee in SF in my opinion
Souvenir Coffee,Quaint little shop but the coffee is amazing and the people amazing-er
Souvenir Coffee,"This place is worth walking to from Page and Market. Love the coffee, pastries, the service. Just the best! Thank you!!!"
Souvenir Coffee,"Cute spot on divisadero, in a central location of the city. Too bad the oat cortado I ordered was super under extracted and sour tasting. The espresso might have tasted better if I ordered it in a latte. Maybe I’ll try again in the future."
Souvenir Coffee,"Souvenir is one of my favorite coffee places in the city! Friendly staff, a Vietnamese coffee that’ll give a nice kick, and a great atmosphere despite being to-go only. They’ve quickly become a part of my daily routine and a calming presence in the midst of all the craziness around us. Wishing this place loads of success and hope they get a Yelp page soon because it deserves all the love possible!"
Souvenir Coffee,Small space with outdoor seating. Really good coffee and good service!
Souvenir Coffee,My fave coffee on Divis- and there is great coffee around here. Complex and balanced. This isn’t the rocket fuel bitter sludge you can sometimes get at other artisanal roasters. These are pour overs and espressos that are more delicate and delicious!!!
Souvenir Coffee,Slowest service of my life and there was only 1 person in front of me.  It took 10 minutes to get a latte. Coffee was ok.
Souvenir Coffee,Brand New Coffee Joint serving up some phenomenal coffee. Their people first attitude is much appreciated! I recommend the Kenya or Rwanda!
Souvenir Coffee,exceptional espresso drinks..... small place with the classic italian espresso bar feel.
Souvenir Coffee,Slim plant filled space with a nice down to earth vibe.  Decent coffee.  Nice outdoor seating for good weather.
Souvenir Coffee,"Excellent coffee and friendly service. Try the flat white or a cortado. If making coffee at home, get the Bali beans."
Souvenir Coffee,Best coffee beans around. You get a free batch brew if you buy coffee beans.
Souvenir Coffee,Great service and product … lots of competition in the neighborhood but I still come here … the staff are all great!
