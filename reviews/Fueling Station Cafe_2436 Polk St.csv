Fueling Station Cafe,"Hands down the most welcoming cafe I’ve discovered in SF so far. All the staff are super nice, especially Lulu! Great menu items at a very good price. The Focaccia bread on Fridays is phenomenal! Definitely worth stopping by if you’re near the Polk street area."
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks for coming in Lamarr! Glad you had a chance to check out our Focaccia Fridays where we do a different flavor every week. Hope to see you again soon.
Fueling Station Cafe,"It's a great place, everyone is super nice and the food and coffee is great. The egg and avocado sandwich is the best. Really tasty and keeps you full for a long while. I tried the waffle and it was delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of whipped cream, but the one they use was soft (not dense as from the can)."
Fueling Station Cafe,Glad you enjoyed the strawberry waffle and your sandwich! Thanks for coming by.
Fueling Station Cafe,I ate here for lunch in my first full day in San Francisco. It is very well priced for the area. I’ve had the drip coffee which was smooth and cheap which was exactly what I was looking for. I also had a chicken Bah Minh which was good quality made with care. The chicken was ok not exactly what I was looking or hoping for for but still good and the service was fantastic. Very friendly and personable. I would recommend if you are visiting the nearby famous Lombard Street.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Salsa Sunrise: Pictured. Delicious, toasty waffle with jalapeño and lots of toppings. Great way to start the day and be not too full."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Ryan, we just brought this customer favorite back on our main menu. Glad you enjoyed it!"
Fueling Station Cafe,"the food was delicious, mushroom coffee delicious, the staff is so attentive and patient. the staff's good mood makes the environment feel warm and welcoming. Will choose this over other neighboring coffee shops any time."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Glad you stopped by and enjoyed your order, Jen! Another chagaccino convert :)"
Fueling Station Cafe,"We had a lovely breakfast with the folks at Fueling Station. The Banh Mi was lovely. Understated but carefully crafted flavor and texture to the carrots, cucumber, and chicken. And a perfect, wonderful light warmth from the spice in the sauce. Great recommendation by the owner.  The banana bread made in house (which the owner made today and offered the recipe for) was excellent and moist - totally reminiscent of my grandmother’s banana bread.  We also had a hot Chaga drink, a cold chaga drink, and a cortado, all with milk alternatives (oat and coconut). Served in for-here glasses/mugs by default. Lovely presentation and flavor. A slight aside: the iced chaga doesn’t seem to get cold quickly perhaps because of the thickness of the liquid. Definitely interested in these functional additives for coffee.  The owner was very personable and was the primary worker in the shop with 3 others. We own a coffee shop on Cape Cod in Massachusetts and I sat inside to observe the coffee process. From what little I did observe (audibly), the owner’s milk steaming is smooth - no frothing, no screaming. I think we made her nervous, telling her we had our own shop, so she offered to bring the cortado. She needed to dial the espresso in again (boy can we appreciate that). She apologized for the wait and even gifted us a bag of their house/espresso roast for the wait.  Would definitely recommend The Fueling Station. Great product, place, and people. Our first experience of the day in SF…and one of the best - certainly the best coffee experience."
Fueling Station Cafe,Thank you for stopping by our cafe as part of your trip. Really enjoyed talking to you. And glad you liked your food and drinks.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Fueling Station Cafe is a standout establishment that excels in delivering delicious pastries, satisfying lunches, and a diverse coffee menu. As a loyal patron, I've come to appreciate their hot chaga drink, which never fails to impress.  The credit for the cafe's success goes to Lily, the owner, who has skillfully managed and developed the business since its inception. Her dedication and business acumen are evident in every aspect of the cafe's operation, creating a welcoming atmosphere for customers to enjoy their dining experience. Fueling Station Cafe is a testament to Lily's vision and hard work, making it a must-visit spot for food and coffee enthusiasts."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Thank you, Matt, for supporting me and our entire Fueling Station crew all these years! It takes a village."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Food 5/5 The Chagacchino (Chaga cacao, cinnamon, vanilla, and monk fruit sweetener) was delightful. Quiche was savory and fresh. Service 5/5 The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and fast. Physical space/ ambiance 5/5 The cafe is spacious with two tables a tall and a normal height one. Some outdoor seating and smaller personal tables. The place was clean and tidy. Will definitely return."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Thanks for trying our chagacchino, which is becoming quite popular. See you again soon, Jose!"
Fueling Station Cafe,Very clean place and super nice staff. Very aware of gluten contamination and knowledgeable about what they can serve you. A few options and even some things from a local bakery!
Fueling Station Cafe,Thank you for visiting our cafe and leaving such a supportive review.   As a small independent business it means a lot to us. Have a great Fleet Week!
Fueling Station Cafe,"My favorite SF cafe for working, meeting, or otherwise sitting and enjoying a Bahn Mi (pastries and other meal offerings are also excellent) and a good cuppa. The Fueling Station is a local family-run business, and Lulu and crew have created a warm and welcoming space to relax amidst the hustle and bustle of SF."
Fueling Station Cafe,Thank you so much for making us your home away from home!
Fueling Station Cafe,"Friendly local coffee shop in a cool neighbourhood Excellent coffee and delicious, moist banana nut bread ."
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks for stopping by! Glad you enjoyed our house-made banana bread. 
Fueling Station Cafe,"Amazing range of coffeeshop meals, great attention to detail. Very friendly staff.  Pleasant space to sit for a while, does not feel like a place to work for an extended period though - the seating and setup is not conducive and comfortable (too large shared tables, a fairly noisy space).  Planning to come here again for a quick meal when I'm in the area."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Unassuming spot on Polk street , very delicious morning breakfast sandwiches for a good price for the city. They even have gluten free bread. Sandwiches and other breakfast options are customizable which makes them a solid option that can cover a bigger crowd food choices wise. Limited seating inside and outside though. Probably can seat 20-25 people."
Fueling Station Cafe,Hi Jatin. Thanks for stopping in. Glad you enjoyed our menu. Did you  get a chance to see our large extra indoor seating area in the back? Perhaps next time.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Banh Mi Sandwich - delicious Cold Brew - full of flavor notes and SMOOTH (low acidity). Staff - friendly, warm, welcoming. If you live near by you're doing yourself a disservice by not stopping by here on a regular basis. Picture is the pork Banh Mi and wow was it tasty, the bread is just the right amount of crunch."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Friendliest staff I have ever encountered at a breakfast place, bagels were a bit flat but amazing lox regardless— breakfast waffle with avocado was amazing"
Fueling Station Cafe,Super good food! Staff were very nice!There is also a clean bathroom.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Second time I try to get a tofu Banh Mi and second time I got it with meat! I really want to try it, but I DON'T EAT MEAT!! I mean, maybe I don't understand and this is the next level tofu that looks, tastes and feels like pork (according to my friends that ate it).  2 times tho! Common!! :("
Fueling Station Cafe,"Hi Dee Dee. Thanks for taking the time to leave a review, but you will be amazed how often people mistake our tofu for meat. The tofu is marinated and twice cooked to give it great umami flavor and meaty texture. Of course errors do happen on our end, but we try to be very mindful of people's dietary requests (we have employees who are vegetarians/ vegans).  If you want to come by and try it again, feel free to ask who is making your sandwich to show you the tofu first. If it's a pick up order to go, feel free to call us with any questions or concerns.  Thanks again."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Lovely spot that has everything I want in a cafe. Great coffee, fantastic food, WiFi, plenty of seating, lots of outlets, clean interior, pleasant staff members. I definitely recommend if you’re looking for somewhere to work, read, or just eat!"
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks for hanging out with us!
Fueling Station Cafe,Enjoyed our coffee and the service was quick and friendly. Such a nice neighborhood to walk around.
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks for spending your Memorial Day holiday with us!
Fueling Station Cafe,"A surprisingly awesome coffee place that also happens to have excellent food. Or maybe it’s the other way around.  Proper shots for sure.  It can get a little heck-tick and confused when it gets really busy.  Outdoor seating also, and limited street parking.  Service was fast and super friendly. Great, cozy neighborhood spot."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Thanks, Joe! We’d like to think it’s a bit of both ;-)"
Fueling Station Cafe,"Good coffee, good food, and the best chocolate muffins in SF and banana bread serve here!"
Fueling Station Cafe,"Thank you for the kind words, Angela!"
Fueling Station Cafe,Very friendly staff. Tried an Amish Palmer for the first time and it was delicious! Wifi not the best but i will 100% come back with a book on a nice afternoon.
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks Michelle for the review and visiting our cafe! I’m glad you enjoyed our Amish Palmer. We actually have a consult meeting with our wi-fi provider so come back and give us another try soon.

Fueling Station Cafe,"The place is spacious, clear, cozy. The snacks and sweets are great. When you go to San Francisco, don't forget to stop by and taste the salmon toast."
Fueling Station Cafe,Love this cafe! The matcha latte and chai are delicious. And their banh mi's are fresh and affordable. I like their other breakfast foods too. My favorite cafe on Polk St.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Lovely coffee shop with a warm, community feel. Loved the egg and avocado croissant!"
Fueling Station Cafe,"This place is just wonderful. The staff were so friendly and sweet, and the food is absolutely incredible. I watched somebody in front of me order the bahn mi again because it was so good that they wanted another one. I had the vanilla latte and a breakfast sandwich and it was just perfect!"
Fueling Station Cafe,Delicious coffee and plenty of space to spread out and work. (Sugar-free syrup option too)
Fueling Station Cafe,My coffee was good but my cookie was sold and stale.
Fueling Station Cafe,This place was great. The food is genuinely good. There is plenty of seating both inside and out everything was great! Service is outstanding.
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks for stopping by Darla. Happy new year!
Fueling Station Cafe,Gotta love the parklets. Decent coffee and seating.
Fueling Station Cafe,I went there for breakfast as it was close to my hotel. I specifically wanted oatmeal and it was the place. The oatmeal was good. Good size portion and delicious. However coffee americano tasted sour. They were nice enough to make me another fresh cup and it tasted slightly better but still bad. Quite disappointing. Something must be wrong either with the beans or with the coffee making process. Staff were nice and friendly.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Great owner and manager who manage to provide tasty and healthy food at rock bottom prices ;  This is my fueling stop before tennis . It’s  hearty bowl of oatmeal, full of fruits and nuts is my daily staple. Sumptuous Vietnamese Sandwiches ( vegetarian or vegan) are my favorites.  Great place to read and study ;  superb internet connection. Friendly service making it a great neighborhood place !  Egalitarian cafe for democrats & aristocrats  !"
Fueling Station Cafe,Thanks Krishin!  Happy to hear that our made to order oatmeal and banh mi sandwiches hit the spot! Always a pleasure to have you.

Fueling Station Cafe,I love Fueling Station! The best coffee and food in the city! They have weekly special drinks and delicious pastries. You can always chat with friendly staff! Highly recommend chicken banh mi sandwich!

Fueling Station Cafe,Great house coffee with patio to enjoy the weather when it's nice.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Great local spot for coffee, tea and a bite to eat. Staff are so friendly and they've a fun Happy Tea Hour"
Fueling Station Cafe,This is a very nice cafe to sit with a cup of tea to get work done. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Overall my experience here was excellent.
Fueling Station Cafe,Great little cafe to stop in and grab a coffee to go.  They recently added their outdoor dining and there are lots of little tables spaced out appropriately.  Staff is always friendly.  Gluten free bread options are available which is a bonus to be able to get a breakfast or lunchtime snack alongside a hot drink!
Fueling Station Cafe,"The salmon toast and chagaccino latte were wonderful!! (It has chaga adaptogenic mushroom powder and Monkfruit for sugar). The staff had genuine smiles and bright eyes, and they seem to be building some sort of backyard patio behind the building. This place is lovely."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Excellent! Great prices for being in gorgeous Russian Hill. Food was delicious and service was spectacular. We had quiche Lorraine, chia pudding, hot oatmeal, bagel with egg and cheese, 2 large coffees, a large hot chocolate, and a white chocolate mocha all for around $60 including tickets."
Fueling Station Cafe,"They have some of the friendliest staff I've evert met!! The coffee is good, the wifi is fast, there are working outlets, it isn't very crowded, its light and spacious, and is on a quiet sunny street. Such a fan :)"
Fueling Station Cafe,I wish this wasn't a short visit to the city. I had the sunrise waffle with bacon and I went back the next day for it.
Fueling Station Cafe,"I sometimes come to this lovely cafe to get coffee, has 'flat white' here which is rare in sf. Every staff makes nice coffee, Oat, soy, coconut, and almond are non dairy options. Has good Wifi, 5 outside tables.  Last time i got a smaller amount coffee than i always get(always full, but this time was way smaller) which was a bit disappointing, but still good coffee, i'll be back."
Fueling Station Cafe,"This is a great place to have breakfast. We ordered bagel and lox, Belgian waffles and a toast with avocado, lox and packed egg and everything was delicious! The hot teas were very good as well. I think it's the best place I've had breakfast in SF."
Fueling Station Cafe,"So happy this is finally open! It's perfect for our walking friendly neighborhood, and is such an inviting space. The coffee and the food is delicious and affordable and the owner and her family are so nice. I really want them to be successful so I will happily buy my morning coffee here every morning (and maybe a waffle too)"
Fueling Station Cafe,Great food and very nice people working here. Highly recommend the Banh mi!

Fueling Station Cafe,My hands down favorite Cafe and Bakery in San Francisco!  Lillian the owner is one of the most talented bakers I’ve encountered!  And she employees excellent baristas!  Munching down on her Banana Bread as I type this!
Fueling Station Cafe,Everyone is so sweet and the food is delicious!
Fueling Station Cafe,"Aww, thanks!"
Fueling Station Cafe,"Their homemade quiche is amazing. I get it every time I’m here. They often sell out by the late morning, so be early!"
Fueling Station Cafe,Thank you Shubhit for being a loyal customer!
Fueling Station Cafe,"New to the neighborhood and stopped in for coffee. Friendly, informative staff, great coffee, chill vibe, plenty of menu food and drink options. My new go-to!"
Fueling Station Cafe,The people are nice. $7 for a large oat milk latte is a joke. Most expensive latte I have had after more than 6 years in SF.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Hi Thomas. Thank you for visiting our cafe. Our “standard” 12 oz double shot Latte is $4.50. When upgrading to a large 16 oz, we put an additional double shot of espresso (quad) for $1.50 and oat milk is an additional $1. We would also be happy to make you a large 16oz oat latte without the additional shot if you prefer a milkier drink for $5.50. Thank you & take care."
Fueling Station Cafe,Amazing hot cider!! Very friendly & welcoming.i apologize for bringing in a sandwich 🥪 .. but definitely will be back to try some amazing food! …

Fueling Station Cafe,"Great coffee, lovely crema and flavour. The chocolate bread is delicious. Staff super friendly too. Chilled vibe."
Fueling Station Cafe,Awesome new place in Russian Hill.  Delicious coffee and the staff is so nice. One morning their credit card swipe wasn't working and they insisted I take it for free.  Definitely worth a try.
Fueling Station Cafe,"Dirty chai w/ almond milk and honey and the salmon toast were perfect! Fueling station is in a quieter spot on Polk, with a great selection of teas, breakfast options, chips, breads, sweets, and drinks!  Update: I've now gotten out of line at Saint Frank twice to head to FS instead - dirty chai is so much better and so is the food selection (which is nonexistent at St F).  ALSO they have a HH for tea and food, but I forget the details."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Love the fueling station! Delicious coffee, amazing herbal teas and a new delight -raspberry cinnamon roll - homemade and delicious!"
Fueling Station Cafe,"Thanks, Clare! Glad you like our latest cinnamon roll flavor. We're also trying new flavors and welcome customer feedback."
Fueling Station Cafe,"Simple place with friendly service, tasty food and quality coffee. Usually less crowded than the other coffee spots on Polk which makes it a good place to do some work."
Fueling Station Cafe,They better start letting patrons use their bathroom or they won't have any patrons left...I wont go back...I' ll go down to Royal Ground instead...one employee there...the owner!  And the bathroom is open to patrons...

Fueling Station Cafe,"Great coffee, but I'll always remember the delicious salmon toast and caring women who work here."
Fueling Station Cafe,Wish I would've came here instead of saint franks down the street. They have breakfast sandwiches at least. Not sure if they have different sized coffee cups. Saint Frank's sure dont.
Fueling Station Cafe,Good place for sandwiches. Coffee is okay.
Fueling Station Cafe,The avocado toast with bacon and poached egg is the best I’ve ever had
Fueling Station Cafe,"They don't seem to be really well organized. It took 20 minutes to get a coffee and a tea. Coffee and croissant we're good, though."
Fueling Station Cafe,Really friendly staff.  Casual neighborhood coffee sit with light breakfasty nibbles.  Love the Vietnamese coffee.
