Bean Bag Cafe,"Poor service and food was adequate at best. Honestly I ate better in Army dining halls. Asked specifically for hash browns and they brought some horrible pan fried potatoes with no condiments. When I went inside and asked for salt, pepper and anything to add some taste to the sorry mess they brought ketchup! Then the manager had the nerve to ask me if anything was wrong. One piece of toast with a single small pat of butter. Absolutely no refills of a cup of brewed coffee? We can bring you one but you have to pay for it before you leave?🙄#wontbeback"
Bean Bag Cafe,The staff was so nice to me and my smoothie was so good! Would 100% recommend for a fun drink and food.
Bean Bag Cafe,A gem of the city- diner feels with a full variety menu. Incredibly kind and hard working staff. Hard to find places like this these days
Bean Bag Cafe,The Jamaican crepe was incredible. Filled with banana and caramel and coconut sauce. I’ll be back and bringing my family!
Bean Bag Cafe,"One of my favorite spots in the city. Food and coffee are great,  but the service and ppl are the greatest. I like the red smoothie, burrito, iced coffee, chilaquiles, and falafel tacos but truly you can’t go wrong."
Bean Bag Cafe,"First time here and i will say i am coming back regularly. The service was top-notch, kuddos to the gentleman at the cashier, well mannered and dished out drinks in quick fashion. What’s most notable about this place is the warm and comfortable tone you get while eating here, not to mention the food is simply put amazing. If you have any doubts about coming to try this place out i assure you, you wont be dissatisfied."
Bean Bag Cafe,Really good breakfast place with great vegetarian options
Bean Bag Cafe,Good customer service! Polite and friendly staff. Tried their Chagachino and was great!
Bean Bag Cafe,"Outstanding customer service. Never been here before. I called in to see if they had blended coffee drinks, akin to a Starbucks Frappuccino.  The young lady I spoke with said they didn’t but that she’d be willing to make the drink for me.  I showed up and not only did she try, but she seemed happy to do so. And to go above and beyond she offered to give me the left overs  from the blender which was like another 8 ounces of drink, or to make me something else if I didn’t like it.  That’s how to do business. Even though her attempt at the mocha Frappé didn’t hit my pallet the way I would have liked, I truly appreciated the gesture.  As far as the atmosphere of the café, vibes were calm and casual. No music blaring in the background. Plus the art on the walls and the wooden furniture gave the café a warm and homey feel.  Thank you young lady for your hospitality, I hope future customers receive the warm reception you showed me.  All the best and cheers to your next local discovery."
Bean Bag Cafe,My cappuccino was full of coffee grounds and coarse ones. They used coarse coffee grounds for making espresso. 🤦‍♂️  It's a cafe and not a coffee shop. Coffee products are just another item on the menu of things they sell. I wouldnt buy any espresso drinks from here.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great place to grab a coffee/beer, work remotely, and/or have a bite. Outdoor seating and love it here!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"So I will say, at first I ordered 2 mochas but the server gave us Hot Chocolate’s. We then approached her about changing our drink and she was more than happy to do so. In fact, she kept the Hot Chocolate and added like 2 espresso shots to it, which made for one of the best Mochas I’d ever had. Like why tf doesn’t everyone do this? It tasted so good. Anyway, the customer service was great and the coffee was even better. Lots of food options as well. The vibe inside was great too. It’s in a great location being that it’s right next to a park. I would highly recommend for some food or just some coffee."
Bean Bag Cafe,Great breakfast spot with the best Iced Mochas! I would recommend for sure and they are friendly!
Bean Bag Cafe,Delicious food and coffee. Friendly: blended protein powder I had into their smoothies. Customized food orders.
Bean Bag Cafe,Nice little place! Had a breve latte 👌
Bean Bag Cafe,"This place is so warm and friendly. An amazing spot for anything you might want. Would love to visit everyday I cannot recommend it enough. Fair prices, friendly faces, good food"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Excellent restaurant with large choice of soft drinks, hot or cold, perfect for breakfast or coffee. I do recommend !"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Very hip, good energy cafe on divisdero and hayes. Mostly calm throughout the week and more upbeat during Fridays. The staff is very friendly and accommodating 🙏"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Such a nice spot. Amazing sandwiches, lots on tap, coffee, breakfast, all amazing. Service is always spectacular."
Bean Bag Cafe,"first visit - Loved the mocha, but will go there again to try other things  Second visit - ordered the jaguar savory crepe, loved it, it was delicious with the salad on the side. Also tried chagacino, oh I loved it ❤️. The person behind the counter was the most elegant barista I had ever met. She was playing some Parisian vibes jazz which went so great with the rainy weather today. I really felt like I was sitting in a cafe in Paris, and she had that foreign accent or way of speaking or something which made me feel so welcomed there. Loved this experience.  Visit #3: Thai iced tea was good, just as you would expect it."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Good menu options. The hamburger is great and the steak fries are the best. Amble seating, kind service, and easygoing overall."
Bean Bag Cafe,Good coffee place with great choice of plates. I had the Special Salmon and it was delicious and a very good amount of food ! we recommend this place !
Bean Bag Cafe,"As I read a book at Bean Bag, my new favorite cafe , I overhear a conversation;  a young woman aghast at her friend’s sipping hot chocolate through a straw: “ hey I don’t mean to judge you but I am going to judge you - but this is really ridiculous”; Divisadero street has easy bonhomie and Ben Bag is its best cafe ; exterior is light olive green with a mural of a Greek goddess greeting you with mixture of intrigue and shyness ; the four dollar draft beer during happy hour is a great deal. The soundtrack today is Brazilian samba."
Bean Bag Cafe,"My favorite cafe in SF for working. Excellent food & coffee: try the specialty tacos, burgers, crepes, breakfast sandwich, breve latte….honestly it’s all great. Accessible electrical outlets, good wifi, dogs allowed, relaxed atmosphere, clean restrooms. They don’t bat an eye if you sit there all day nursing a single black coffee (but of course you should buy stuff!). Above all, the owner and staff are relentlessly friendly and accommodating."
Bean Bag Cafe,"It’s been 12 years, still great!  I first visited this place 12 years ago and it was amazing then both early and later in the evening. It was the launching point of many a great night.  I’ve return all this time later nervous that it would have changed beyond recognition. THANKFULLY not it’s great.  Staff were amazing and super friendly, food was delicious and quick. Drinks (non-alcoholic) were beyond amazing. Sadly I didn’t get a chance to reminisce with some beers in the evening. Maybe next time."
Bean Bag Cafe,TACOS TACOS TACOS. Strongly encourage the owners to go all-in on the new tacos concept menu add. Honestly some of the best I have had. Will be back as often as I can before I need to queue for a long time for the beauties.
Bean Bag Cafe,Amazing SF institution. Get the breakfast burrito or tacos. Owner is hella friendly. This place just vibes.
Bean Bag Cafe,"We visited this place at first time and got a warm welcome from a service! So friendly person! Thanks mate! ;) He introduced a menu and suggested choices for a late lunch! Amazing service!!  Huge cup of coffee latte! It's not easy to find a tasty coffee in LA, but this place has it! Definitely a like! Chicken toast was delicious as well! The host understood that we were gonna share it and proposed it!  The last but not least, the host gave us a warm bye-bye words! Overall, the place has exceptional workers + delicious food! I would definitely go there again!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Cool place, really nice staff and the food plus coffee was good and affordable."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great environment of business professionals, college students, and skateboarders alike. Good beers on tap and excellent mimosas for those mornings you need a little extra help waking up."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Food is actually really great, and the staff is friendly at first. Then they all turn crazy when you ask for the wifi code.  Last time, I ate my meal, then asked for the code. But they said they couldn't prove I had a meal, so no wifi for you!  Today (a Friday), this sign was out. We asked for a wifi code as soon as we ordered two meals. They said there's no wifi. I pointed to the sign. They said there's no wifi on weekends. I reminded them that today is Friday. They said Friday is the weekend. We asked them to take the sign down or flip it to the ""try our nopales"" side. They said they wanted to keep it up. No wifi for you!  Done ever trying to work here (and spend my money here) again."
Bean Bag Cafe,Food was great. Server was very nice and welcoming.
Bean Bag Cafe,Great food and the people who work there are the best. One of my SF favorites!
Bean Bag Cafe,Friendly and good food.
Bean Bag Cafe,Love the vibe. Nice outdoor seating. Nice varied menu.
Bean Bag Cafe,"This place is awesome if not for the simple fact that they literally have something for everyone!! Been here on my last two trips to SF.  Both times I’ve had one of their bagels sandwiches.  Let me tell you, I have no idea how they get the bagel to be so soft and warm.  Perfect!! They have tacos and burritos and crepes and a bunch of other things. Great for that large party where you have to satisfy different wants"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Came to this place to have some coffee and it was really bad. I just recommend you to go there to eat as they have a really varied menu, you can also go there and work with your laptop.  Depending on the hour you arrive, you might find a line to order so, prepare to wait."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Some people love it and it's an absolute paragon of the neighborhood. I didn't really enjoy my breakfast sandwich, just tasted so plain and boring which might be on me. The coffee was good dinner variety coffee, very darkly roasted."
Bean Bag Cafe,"The Bean Bag Cafè is one of those places that have something for everyone. From pastries, to salads, to sandwiches, I have yet to be disappointed by their food. The interior is interesting with lots of art on the walls and definitely has a homey feel to it. Staff has always been patient and food out out fairly quickly, even when they are busy. I had a scramle once there that was delicious. I can't remember the name of it, but it had chicken and potatoes. Tasted marvelous and came out quick! Their chicken sandwich is good too."
Bean Bag Cafe,"I live in the neighborhood so I always go here. The staff are always very courteous and friendly. They seem to really like what they do. The food is great and the portions are just right. If you have a smaller appetite, two people can share a plate of anything on the menu. I like their savory crepes the best."
Bean Bag Cafe,One of my favorite San Franciscan neighborhood cafes. Staff is super friendly and food pretty decent with lots of healthy options. Love their Benedicts. Most of the stuff here are verysonable prices by SF standard. It also has free WiFi and you can bring a book or laptop to sit for a few hours. Bean bag cafe gives the neighborhood a bit more human community feel than just some high-end overpriced restaurants which NOPA is increasing developing into.
Bean Bag Cafe,"We ordered 4 drinks and not one of them was hot, they were warm at best. Really disappointed ☹️."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Delicious breakfast, so many options and very well done! And the service was fast and very friendly. Perfect for a brunch with friends or by yourself"
Bean Bag Cafe,Good atmosphere! Had a California sandwich w fresh mix. Liked it a lot!
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great food and service. The folks there are very friendly. We ate breakfast here a few times during our trip to San Francisco. The only disappointment was that they ran out of decaf coffee one morning. Still, we would go back."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great atmosphere. Wonderful people who work at the establishment, they put so much love and passion into their work; that goes for both the waiters/waitresses and the cooks. The best burgers I’ve ever had came from this place, so obviously I would recommend that. Drinks are great, food is amazing, and the people are spectacular."
Bean Bag Cafe,Great coffee and really good food. Their crepes are also interesting and unusual combinations- I had the citron and it was delicious. The ambience and service were also excellent.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great friendly people, terrific food. Rancho huevo   plate was delicious, good coffee as well. This was our go-to spot for breakfast while in San Francisco."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great food, ambiance, and 3 dollar draft beer from 3-10pm, daily..."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Very friendly & nice staff! It's pretty busy, but they do well it's getting you your order quickly! It's pricey, but their burrito is really good, too! I got the al pastor, and I loved it!  The burrito is pretty big, so it's worth the price, only a few bucks more than everybody else's burritos, and I think way better! The tacos are pretty good, too; and speaking of two, be sure to order two so you can get the happy hour price on beer, as ordering one doesn't cut it, for some reason.  They've usually got a pretty good selection of beers on tap, for only three bucks (during happy hour, $4.50 otherwise) with food purchase (of anything, or two tacos). Indoor and outdoor seating are both available, but the outdoor seating is right on the sidewalk, and the sidewalks about 3 in wide! Luckily, Shared Spaces SF has just been made permanent, so their parklet seating should be there, as well!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"The cafe had a European vibe. Their egg sandwich and hot cocoa were my perfect evening snack. An artist, @moseenmomade, painted the cafe while we were having our food. The experiemce was surreal"
Bean Bag Cafe,"The food is delicious and comes out really quick, the service was also very caring. For drinks we got coffee and a smoothie both were great. Will definitely come back in the future."
Bean Bag Cafe,20 min wait and 3 requests to bus the table so I can sit after ordering food.  No WiFi on the weekend.  Mediocre food and coffee.  Also the food is expensive for a dive cafe - same price for breakfast plates as any good restaurants in town - $16-$19 for a plates.  Zero ambience.  Better skip…plenty of other options in the hood and beyond.
Bean Bag Cafe,Absolutely loved the crepes I got here.
Bean Bag Cafe,My food arrived very quickly. The portions are extravagant. This is so far my favorite place in SF to chill and grab a quick bite. Definitely recommend!
Bean Bag Cafe,"Don't bother if you want to order ahead.  I ordered three tacos on GrubHub to be picked up. I arrived at the pick up time and the food wasn't ready. They said 10 minutes. Okay. After ten minutes, it was going to take ten more minutes. I leave, come back, and they give me two cold tacos. I say that I ordered three tacos, and they say, well, it's the app's fault. Okay, how should I order ahead then? They say that since I came in twice, I obviously have the time to come in person and wait.  Not great."
Bean Bag Cafe,Very tasty sweet Hayes (peach and papaya) and fried tofu.
Bean Bag Cafe,Very good pasta. Loved it. 12.5$ + tax.
Bean Bag Cafe,Sorry for being rude about their coffee really loudly. It was nice coffee really.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Awesome place for crepes and breakfast fare. Chill vibe and friendly servers add to an overall excellent experience. I especially love the smoked salmon crepe, and the perfectly crispy home fries were a revelation. I live close by so I generally order takeout, but there are usually enough seats to dine in with no hassle. Good stuff!"
Bean Bag Cafe,Great neighborhood spot for breakfast and lunch. Great menue!
Bean Bag Cafe,Portobello mushroom sandwich with the best potatoes ever! Excellent service and food
Bean Bag Cafe,Bought a Chagaccino with oat milk. Turns out they made it with dairy milk. I've been sick since I'm intolerant. This could be really bad in case someone is allergic to dairy.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Many food and beverage options, Wi-Fi and plug points. The barista is quite friendly. I enjoyed the lavender lemonade and parfait (granola, fruits, and yoghurt)."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Some of the best food in San Francisco and definitely the best atmosphere. I moved away 20 years a go and still talk about them. Wife and I just went back and the owner is still there, like he is every morning and without missing a beat says to me "" it's been a while, Jason, good to see you."" If you get the chance check it out.  Driver J"
Bean Bag Cafe,Excellent eggs and other breakfast items!
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great place to stop in solo or with a friend and have a light meal, snack, or beverage of your choosing (coffee, smoothies, beer, lots of choices). Lots of seating inside or outside. Right off Divisadero & Hayes which are high car and foot traffic so not the best spot for heart to hearts or sensitive ""it's not you, it's me""  conversations. 😉"
Bean Bag Cafe,"When I lived across the street, my favorite here if you like tuna was bodega bay and fries! Above average quality food at a corner cafe!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"This place became somewhat of a local for our breakfast when staying in SF last month. Great food, either cooked breakfasts (the breakfast potato is delicious) our the very good granola and fruit with a very generous fruit serving. Coffee is nothing to get too excited about but it served its purpose and was by no means a let down. Staff were efficient more than they were friendly - but it’s a very busy little place so that’s forgivable. I liked the window seats - great people watching over breakfast!  Also free wifi is an obvious draw card lots of people tapping away on laptops and devices over their meals / drinks."
Bean Bag Cafe,Great wholesome breakfast with nice staff.  Watch locals pass by from corner cafe. Highly recommend 😎 …
Bean Bag Cafe,Lots of vegetarian options in the menu. Ordered a portobello sandwich which was ok but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The staff provided friendly and good service
Bean Bag Cafe,"A neighborhood favorite with great happy hour beer specials on a good selection of drafts. They're been focusing on tacos and burritos recently, and while they're not cheap, the quality is top-notch. Try the al pastor."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Bustling place with good crepes (savory and sweet) and drinks (smoothies, my fave was ginger lemonade). Quick and friendly service and a nice vibe of art and music. Would come again."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Took me 3 years of living in the neighborhood to visit bc it's so unassuming, but I was blown away. They're very kind, my chilaquiles and latte were fantastic, and I like the order first setup. Very friendly neighborhood vibes sitting out on the patio, good for puppy watching."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Be ready to waste at least half an hour for a bagel... our experience was really bad today my hot cholate was 3 quarter cup of foam, my coworker's bagel was dropped on the floor while bagged, no acknowledge or thanks for the extreme wait... all I ordered was a plain bagel witb cream cheese. Nothing too complicated"
Bean Bag Cafe,I go here for lunch a couple times a week. Salads and sandwiches are excellent. Staff are friendly. Has a relaxed neighbourhood feel to it. Beer selection is good. Looks like a good place to bring your laptop and work as many people do this.
Bean Bag Cafe,Always a great hangout in the heart of the cool and chill divis corridor. Great food and beer at reasonable prices
Bean Bag Cafe,"No frills type of place.  Decent coffee.  No other coffee spot open as late in the area. Diverse, eclectic crowd."
Bean Bag Cafe,I've been going to this place since it's been open. It was a chill spot  for my grandmother and I.  I love the owner and his brother.  Always made me and my daughter feel welcome.  I used to know every employee but the current ones are great as well. Great service and food.
Bean Bag Cafe,"The neighborhood go to. Chilaquiles, Benedict, or a classic BEC. Can’t go wrong."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Get the Carnitas tacos!! Super friendly. Good prices. The menu is extensive, which can be arresting, so lemme help: always get the homestyle fries, pesto crepe, any taco, or the breakfast burrito. Smoothies here are also 👌 for the park …"
Bean Bag Cafe,Went there to do some work on my laptop. Sign said wifi only with a meal. So I bought the meal and then the barista said they weren’t giving any internet codes out regardless. Such a dumb policy and even dumber that they don’t have an accurate sign.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great, affordable food that came out at a very reasonable speed. They allow dogs inside so we could visit with our dog! Adequate amount of seating and looks like they sold good beer if you fancy a couple of pints!"
Bean Bag Cafe,Great go to local cafe..friendly.. best comfort food/breakfast in NOPA area! ..their tacos are amazing too!
Bean Bag Cafe,Good crepes! Was a little crowded.
Bean Bag Cafe,"This is ridiculous.. we ordered breakfast burritos an hour ago, were told they would be ready in 25-30 minutes. We arrive after 30 minutes to wait in line another 20+ minutes.. get to the front to pay and they still aren’t ready yet… that’s terrible customer service"
Bean Bag Cafe,"This place is the cutest. friendly staff, loads of options."
Bean Bag Cafe,Nice spot for rest and tasty food. We sat outside . . . I gave in and fries with my order.  Indoor seating available.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Excellent breakfast menu, nice coffee, friendly staff"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Healthy foods collection with a large food menu. So many options to choose and customize tastes and flavors. Musical environment, very lovely. I loved the drink options, delicious and healthy juices are available. They have a nice combination of foods with fruit and dishes."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Came here for breakfast/lunch 3 times while visiting San Francisco from the UK. Food and service was excellent and we were always made to feel really welcome. Great atmosphere in a lovely setting, would definitely return here when visiting again!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"A great little bar, caff, WiFi zone. The beers were great, the prices were good, the atmosphere was lovely. What more can you expect. I'll bet the food was good too but we just had drinks. Check it out."
Bean Bag Cafe,"You'll think it's the '00s again!  Your refuge from $9 toast and even better, the people who love $9 toast.  The food is reliable, the staff are sharp and the music is always a surprise. As good for a quick to-go as it is for a sit-and-stay.  Bean Bag Cafe has toast, too."
Bean Bag Cafe,I enjoy going to bean bag as they always have a great selection for breakfast and lunch!
Bean Bag Cafe,"Bean Bag Cafe is an excellent neighborhood small business! Lots of seating with spacious tables and plenty of food and drink options.  The coffee here is LEGIT - I'm the type of person who drinks 3-4 cups of coffee per day and a large House Blend from here wired me up for the whole day! Not sure if I got an extra-caffeinated batch, though."
Bean Bag Cafe,Went here to catch up with a group of friends. The vibe was great. Social but not too loud. We grabbed a group of tables in the middle of the cafe and that didn't seem to be an issue.  I ordered the Petaluma sandwich with avocado and a side salad. It was great -- the sandwich was warm but not overly toasted (which I really hate). The salad was generously portioned with a tart balsamic vinaigrette. My friends ordered beer which was decent and according to them fairly cheap.  Knocking one star because the cashiers were needlessly unfriendly when I ordered -- terse questions and little eye contact.
Bean Bag Cafe,"If you're in the mood for inexpensive beers, this is the place to go. Of course the ambience feels more like that of a coffee shop, seeing as it IS a coffee shop. It's a cute coffee shop though with the right amount of personality. Their breakfast burritos are delicious, large, and perfect hangover cures. They have outdoor seating right on Divis which makes for great people watching and it's always busy, but not too busy."
Bean Bag Cafe,"I have been a regular here at Bean Bag for over 20 years for good reason. Very friendly staff and a wide variety of quality food from breakfast, lunch to dinner! 🤗"
Bean Bag Cafe,The burger there was really tasty. Usually burgers are flavorless and you have to add a ton of catsup or something. This patty had a great flavor.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Nice laid back place with space to eat outside, which I LOVE! Only had the breakfast and the baja caeser salad but both were great! Service is friendly. Decent beer selection."
Bean Bag Cafe,Owner charges $4 for black coffee and requires a $15 minimum order for access to the Wi-Fi password. Will take my business across the street to The Mill
Bean Bag Cafe,"Hi Corner, I am very sorry that you have the wrong  information. we charge $3.50 for large coffee and we offer free Wi-Fi with a purchase of a meal ,  I hope this clears Things up and hope to see you soon . thank you for your review"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Nice atmosphere with ample seating. Good food at a decent price, although drink prices on the chalk board were incorrect. Great happy hour with $3 beers from 3-10 PM every day!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"A well lit corner café, with a full menu of smoothies, breakfast and lunch options. Very enjoyable Atmosphere!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Love the vibe here. Friendly staff, variety of foods on offer (and beer!), great decor that feels like home."
Bean Bag Cafe,Very good coffee and friendly staff
Bean Bag Cafe,"I've been going to the Bean Bag Cafe for more than 14 years and it's great. It is one of the last original businesses on divisedero that is still left. It's real, honest and original. A large coffee is the real large size not the puny little cup the hipster faux fancy places nearby offer, and is $2.75 instead of the ridiculous price over $4 at spyglass (that makes watery crud anyhow) or the Mill. Food is excellent and they serve breakfast lunch and dinner. Some times hard to get a table at brunch. They do have some outside."
Bean Bag Cafe,Bring back the pasta !!! I love this place however they removed the pasta not sure why but it’s very disappointing because nobody makes it the same
Bean Bag Cafe,"Good strong coffee. Solid breakfast and lunch menu of crepes, burritos, and sandwiches. (I haven't tried dinner yet). Tasty selection of local beers on tap for just $2.50 a pint during happy ""hour"", 3PM til close daily. Fast free WiFi. Lively ample outdoor seating. Clean bathroom. Super friendly owner and staff. Interior just got a facelift with beautiful reclaimed wood countertops while still retaining the original Bean Bag charm."
Bean Bag Cafe,"This place is a class act. The food is an incredible value, it tastes absolutely amazing and the price is not super crazy. The staff is attentive and genuinely concerned about your experience. The only way I won't come here again and again and again is if I die first."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Love this place, great comfort food. Friendly service."
Bean Bag Cafe,Centrally located cafe to go and work Have decent food options as well Staff is friendly
Bean Bag Cafe,"This is a great Sunday morning breakfast spot that has surprisingly escaped the San Francisco brunch mafia.  It's often lively, but rarely crowded; there are a few tables outside on the sidewalk european-style and additional seating inside.  The coffee is solid, as are the crepes, which dominate the menu.  Portions here aren't particularly hearty, but that goes with the territory.  Nurse your hangover here--the sunshine will do you good."
Bean Bag Cafe,Bean bag café has a large menu option. Their orange juices are not freshly pressed so I gave a try to the ginger lemonade. I was very strong in ginger but very tasty.  You can work at the table tops they have a lot of plugs. And the WiFi password is at the bottom of their receipt. The only issue if you'd like to work is that the music is extremely loud (rap and R&B radio on the day I was there)
Bean Bag Cafe,"A neighborhood classic with great coffee, a surprisingly large menu and a very friendly staff!"
Bean Bag Cafe,Delicious food and excellent service on a busy day. Great vegetarian options too!
Bean Bag Cafe,Favorite place in SF to get some work done while enjoying a drink and some bites. Good healthy food choices. Great beer selection and prices. Happy hour!
Bean Bag Cafe,"Opted out of Popeyes, deciding on local business.  Ordered a couple of cheeseburgers.  Perfectly cooked, large patty and very tasty!  Large order of fries included.  Will be back for sure."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Maybe we just had a bad experience, but the coffee didn't live up to the hype (ordered latte and it was pretty much all milk, better off going to Peet's). On top of that they forgot about our food order. Bit disappointed, I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast."
Bean Bag Cafe,Really good Cafe food. Tasty fries and a week prepared burger. Tacos and portabello sandwich looked delicious. Excellent cappuccino. Good Covid safety.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great breakfast burritos here, and the blueberry pancakes were delicious too!! Fast friendly service!! You can't go wrong at this reliable little spot, indoor and outdoor seating too!"
Bean Bag Cafe,Food is excellent and very good service
Bean Bag Cafe,"Love this place. Well executed dishes, large variety on menu, and delicious pastries. Even when there's a long line, service is quick, and almost always I can find a table, even when crowded."
Bean Bag Cafe,"The wait for food can be long, and the food is good but not great. There were flies around too. That said, it’s good for a chill place to meet a friend for coffee"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Awesome happy hour. Been coming here for over a decade. The beer selection is great, and evolving. Food is good too. People watching is also a plus.divisadero staple for sure!"
Bean Bag Cafe,The guy at the register was friendly and helpful. The food was delish. Plenty of options for food and drinks. Such a welcoming place.
Bean Bag Cafe,Once a week I meet a friend for a drink here. Super comfortable. Friendly staff.Good prices
Bean Bag Cafe,"Thai Iced Tea was great, I don't usually like them but BBC did it right. Basic savory Crepe was a bit disappointing, couldn't taste any cheese through the onions."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Whether you're a student needing to study or wanting to catch up with friends, or a professional needing to do work after hours but out of the office.. or you want to simply hang out in a group or solo - this is the spot for you!! No pretense, great wifi, friendly staff."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Wide variety of food (and crepes), decent prices, and free wifi! You'll find yourself surrounded by people tapping away at their laptops. Feels a little like a hangout area in a workplace. Music is on the louder side."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Bean Bag has been a staple of mine for nearly 20 yrs of daytrips to SF. Their French toast is excellent,  the house potatoes are my favorite anywhere I've been,  and the casual vibe and comfy couch make it a very laid back place to grab a quick bite. Nothing fancy or pretentious,  just reliably good food."
Bean Bag Cafe,Waited for 50min for our food. They said they didn't know what happened to it and wouldn't take responsibility for screwing up our order. We asked for a refund for the crepes since we asked for ice cream and we couldn't take the ice cream to go. They refused and said they would give us whipped cream instead. Really unprofessional. Not worth coming back here.
Bean Bag Cafe,This is a great place for breakfast or brunch. If you're lucky you can grab one of the coveted outside seats on a warm morning. The food is reliable and atmosphere is what you would expect from the neighborhood.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Their Greek omelette was the best omelette I've ever had! It has pesto, feta, and lots of mushrooms. I will certainly be going back here next time I visit San Francisco!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"Great, cheap local food. Like their salads. Good beer selection. Iced coffee is not great, as it tastes like hot coffee just refrigerated, but I'll take what I can get"
Bean Bag Cafe,Nice little place.  Had a late breakfast of French toast.  Don't k ow what the hours are but served breakfast and lunch.  Good size menu.  What I had was good.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Unassuming cafe front, so I had low expectations for the breakfast burrito. But the burrito was great! Plenty of avocado and the beans are cooked right in with the eggs. Really hit the spot!"
Bean Bag Cafe,"I love Bean Bag.  I'm a sucker for good, cheap food. They even have beer and wine for $3! Love their crepes, the quiche, or anything, really.  Great place to sit and work on your laptop."
Bean Bag Cafe,"Nice place, excellent food and amazing service 👌🏽"
Bean Bag Cafe,This place has a limited dairy free section. Staff is friendly and food is served quickly. Gets a little noisy. But that's part of the charm.
Bean Bag Cafe,This place is great. WiFi and great food. Also cheap beer. That's always plus. Staff is fantastic. Can't really ask for much more. All the basic necessities for 2017.
Bean Bag Cafe,"Good coffee and very good food. The service is fast and the staff great , the place has a unique atmosphere that a lot of other restaurants have not. Recommended for a quick eat"
Bean Bag Cafe,They offer vegetarian & vegan items but they're not really because they are cooked with the meat. Even the French fries! Blah! That's so disappointing & I was so hungry during my meeting. Sad customer.
