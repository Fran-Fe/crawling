Snowbird Coffee,"Cute coffee shop with inventive espresso drinks! I got the Cafecito (cortado, but the shot is pulled with brown sugar mixed in the espresso) and it was a unique and delicious flavor. Barista was kind and helped explain all of their drinks. Good pastries too!  Will be back if I’m in the area again!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Delicious coffee! I ordered an oat cappuccino and totally loved the texture and flavor of the coffee.  Their coffee is velvety, smooth and balanced. Prices are comparable to local coffee shops in SF area.  Highly recommend this place for a great cup of coffee!"
Snowbird Coffee,Great coffee in the inner sunset Locally owned and operated! Friendly service
Snowbird Coffee,"Live this small cozy coffee shop where I can be productive too. Great selection of espresso drinks. Great skills! In a great neighborhood where you can hover around for other snacks, pastries and Golden Gate Park"
Snowbird Coffee,I finally had time to walk into this adorable coffee shop. I’m so happy I did! Their coffee is so delicious 😋 love the ambiance. Very cozy. Nice quiet place to relax and also get your work done. Love it. …
Snowbird Coffee,"Minimal little coffee shop with a modern feel. Quick service, no frills. The mocha was barely sweet, which I appreciate, but it had no foam."
Snowbird Coffee,"This coffee shop is definitely a gem in the Inner Sunset area. They have a somewhat small selection of drinks, but the ones they do make they make extremely well! I'm personally not a big coffee drinker, but I was still able to find a go-to drink in their matcha latte (sweetened). Their blue interior, while a bit small, is perfect if you're looking for a little cubby hole to take a break or to get some work done. I'll usually bring friends here when we want to grab a warm drink and sit down a chat of a bit."
Snowbird Coffee,They were so kind and helpful and got my drink made fast but somehow also delicious and beautiful.
Snowbird Coffee,"In a city full of third wave coffee shop now, it’s honestly so easy to screw up a simple cup of coffee…. But the cup I had here was incredible. Ordered an oat milk cortado, and it was probably the yummiest coffee I had in a while - smooth, perfect temperature, and all around so enjoyable. Drank it with a tartine chocolate croissant and it was HEAVENLY!"
Snowbird Coffee,good coffee. the Spaniard (latte with condensed milk) was good
Snowbird Coffee,Definitely a most visit type of place. The coffee is really good. The service is amazing super friendly.  Definitely a great experience for my first visit.
Snowbird Coffee,"Cozy, rustic atmosphere, Snowbird Coffee is a great place to sit and relax. I got the Spaniard, which I found to be quite good. The condensed milk that they use in it added to the creaminessand sweetness of the latte. This is added to the list of cafes that I like to visit whenever I am in the area."
Snowbird Coffee,Best coffee in the Inner Sunset. Hard to get table because of the people on their laptops but there's usually a seat somewhere. Good selection of beans and drinks.
Snowbird Coffee,Fantastic place to duck in and grab a great cup of coffee if you're walking around Golden Gate Park.
Snowbird Coffee,"Good coffee, but be warned! If you get the 16oz ""Batch brew"" (aka drip/house coffee), and order it for ""here,"" you actually only get about 8oz of coffee! You pay the same price as the 16oz to-go cup, but it comes in a small coffee mug and you will be charged $1.00 for refills. Would have preferred to know this ahead of time, as we were enjoying the atmosphere and didn't want to produce waste by using a to-go cup we don't need. Expecting 16oz of coffee and only getting about 8oz was very disappointing!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Got the mocha... But it tasted like a Milk-a, and if that's not clear, it tasted like plain milk."
Snowbird Coffee,"Great coffee with lots of specialty offerings, great neighborhood too iam around in."
Snowbird Coffee,"Was in the area and needed a pick me up. Sad to say, but shakerato is not common where I live. So decided to try it to see what the deal was. Easy to drink and refreshing on a warm sunny day. Nice looking place, standing room only inside."
Snowbird Coffee,Friendly staff. They have only 1 medium blend for most of coffees. I expected a good blend of coffee and milk but have gotten something like a cup of milk. The barista was super nice remake my coffee but still it wasn't great. Maybe just an espresso would taste much better. Unfortunately I cannot know. It's not a terrible place but neither it is exceptional. Just another coffee shop in SF.
Snowbird Coffee,"Delicious pour over coffee options, quick service, nice space. Baked goods seem to run out early on Sundays so go early if you're looking for those."
Snowbird Coffee,A neighborhood classic! No longer has seating indoors but still a nice spot to meet for coffee.
Snowbird Coffee,"Nice coffee, nice bun, but no tables - so no place to sit & work"
Snowbird Coffee,"I love chai tea lattes. I find that most chai aren't spicy enough for my liking. The taste is usually too muted and I find myself wanting more from the drink. However, the chai at Snowbird is AMAZING!! I didn't have much expectation as I was just coming out of physical therapy with my mom. I wanted something to drink, so I ordered the chai. My first sip surprised me!! In a good way! It is spicy, flavorful, and made my tastebuds danced!! I'll definitely be back again! Thank you for making such awesome chai!!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Coffee was decent but somewhat bitter. Interior was clean, but a bit crammed. Wooden benches and bolted down tables were uncomfortable. Staff was courteous and friendly."
Snowbird Coffee,"Not a bad experience, but the staff could have been slightly more helpful/welcoming. Only 2 customers in front of me and still waited a while. Ok, I did order a pour over! I'll be back again."
Snowbird Coffee,"A nice atmosphere and decor, pleasant music. Counter service was mediocre and my espresso was served well after it was pulled.  Drip coffee was yummy. Not the fantastic espresso destination I'd expected."
Snowbird Coffee,Good cafe. I took a macchiato and it and it got a flavor to the cafe that I like.  If you are around the area it is earth the visit.
Snowbird Coffee,COFFEE ICE CUBES IN MY COLD BREW!!! Next. Level. Really cool vibe in here. Highly recommend!
Snowbird Coffee,Every young person knows what a “cool coffee shop” means. Snowbird is the cool coffee shop of Inner Sunset
Snowbird Coffee,"Love Snowbird! I'm a regular customer and have been coming here for the past 6 years. The owners are awesome and care about their community. Snowbird has been a staple of the neighborhood since they've been around - not to mention good coffee, good service, and their goat cheese pretzel is bomb."
Snowbird Coffee,Waste of money. This place is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. It's one of those hipster coffee shops selling off image versus quality. Some workers seem to have an attitude the few times I've been. I also saw an incident when they first opened where a worker disrespected a customer which was shocking to see in what's supposed to be a customer oriented business. There are much better places for coffee in the inner sunset.
Snowbird Coffee,"Best Latte in the inner sunset! The staff seem generally interested in knowing your name and order. Proper coffee takes time. Don't be alarmed by the line, it means it's good. Great place to run into neighbors and also pick up a pastry."
Snowbird Coffee,"Small, quaint coffee spot in the Sunset district with terrific quality espresso served here. One of the many small local coffee shops that is worth the time to try as they also have their own signature drinks as well. Would highly recommend stopping by here if you're in the area!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Snowbird is a great, cozy little spot with amazing coffee. They have your standard lattes, cappuccinos, and more, but also serve special drinks like the Spaniard and my personal favorite, the Shakerato.  Snowbird has changed since the pandemic with it only being take-out nowadays. No longer does anyone need to jockey over outlets and seating!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Snowbird is a chill, casual multi-roaster coffee spot that offers plenty of seating room and decent coffee and baked goods. I swing by on a rainy day and got the Spaniard, which is a Spanish latte meaning it has condensed milk that makes it a little sweeter than your average latte. Sure was tasty, but wish it we're a few degrees hotter than served. Pretty cool spot to hang out at as there's seats in the front and back."
Snowbird Coffee,"The vibe inside is pretty cool and chill. I like ambiance and the workers were friendly when I was there. Ordered an 8oz americano with room by the time I finished paying for it, the coffee was ready. I enjoyed the cup of coffee and will be back again."
Snowbird Coffee,"Coffee is totally a subjective and personal preference, but Snowbird is the only spot in SF where I actually fantasize about my next cappuccino. The pastries are also really good, although I cannot remember which bakery they use.  The place is cramped and cozy, with low ceilings and not a ton of seating; on weekends it can get quite loud sometimes.  But highly recommended. There is WiFi as well, which you will need because there’s no cell reception for some weird reason."
Snowbird Coffee,"Snowbirds is one of my favorite SF cafes and have some of the best baristas around. I'm very particular with my coffee and these guys roast and make incredible, balanced espresso and fantastic pourovers.  Not to mention, the staff is incredibly friendly and they make it feel like coming home. The vibe is great too, with good seating options and perfect ambience.  Snowbirds truly is a gem and I'm so happy that we have them in the Inner Sunset!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Great Coffee! The barista is friendly and their service is fast. They know what they are doing. They have several tables, I imagine it would be a good place to get work done. It's very cute as well. It's kind of hidden but I really like this coffee shop!"
Snowbird Coffee,Really awesome place just we payed 3.75 for half a cup
Snowbird Coffee,I love coffee and this place serves it up in a cozy neighborhood vibe. TIP: metered parking but just drive up a block for free parking.
Snowbird Coffee,"Amazing mocha. Baristas are friendly. A lot of the tables are a little awkward to sit at, I think they are trying to prevent too many people using laptops which is understandable. They do have a big table up front for us cafe workers though, but no power outlets. Good vibes though, pretty quiet."
Snowbird Coffee,"Delicious cappuccino, nice comfy atmosphere, and friendly staff. Highly recommended"
Snowbird Coffee,I love the smell when you walk into Snowbird. It's a mix of clean and coffee. The space is small but never crowded and the servers are always nice and amenable. I like their cold brew quite a bit. Their hot tea selection is excellent. Pop in before you board the Muni.
Snowbird Coffee,"Did not have the coffee so I honestly can't tell you how the coffee is. Ordered a chai latte that comes in a small cup, price is $3.50, it was creamy, smooth, definitely on the bland side. Customer service was quick, friendly and genuine. My guess is to stick with coffee drinks here. Big plus they have Smashing Pumpkins playing on the stereo system."
Snowbird Coffee,"My favorite coffee shop in the Inner Sunset - great coffee, good people, and almost never a line. I do wish there was more seating and more comfortable seating for working (the benches are very uncomfortable and the tables too small for a computer and a coffee), but great for grabbing a coffee and leaving."
Snowbird Coffee,"Best spot for coffee in the Inner Sunset. Their baristas are super friendly and try to call you by name if you’re a regular and their coffee & specialty drinks are great. My only wish is that they didn’t sell out of pastries so quickly in the day and that they had a couple more plugs. Otherwise, the perfect neighborhood café!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Wonderful pour over coffees. Friendly, talented baristas (saw some beautiful latte art going out) with a down home cozy atmosphere made me go back every morning while visiting SF. Never too crowded (like most of the other over rated coffee shops in the immediate area) so finding an open table was never a problem."
Snowbird Coffee,"I was looking for a great coffee/pastry place while staying in the city and came across Snowbird Coffee. After seeing how everyone was raving about it in the ratings I decided to give it a shot. I am not sure why it has such a high rating because this place was okay at best.  I ordered a coffee and a croissant. I pay and think the amount is a bit exorbitant for a large coffee and croissant - $8.65. The cashier proceeds to tell me she accidently charged me for a ham and cheese croissant, so they had to cancel my order and ring me up again.  I had come with a friend and she ordered after me. We sat down, waited a few minutes, and began eating our pastries. Her latte is called out but my coffee still isn't available. I go up and ask about my coffee, and the barista lied to me saying ""someone walked off with it."" Um no, you never sat it out. I was watching the counter the whole time. After asking for it I finally received my coffee.  The only reason this place gets two stars instead of one is because the coffee was quite delicious. Otherwise the service sucked, the pastries were overpriced and dry, and while I am thankful the cashier redid my order, I don't like that I was overcharged in the first place. I probably will not be coming here ever again."
Snowbird Coffee,"Friendly staff with damn good coffee. I enjoyed a refreshing iced coffee while admiring the patrons surrounding me. This place is filled with people working, conversing, reading, you name it. Definitely a spot to sit and relax (or work) while the scent of fresh coffee lingers in the air."
Snowbird Coffee,"Coffee is really good! Limited pastry selection but there's usually 1-2 things I like. Turning into a bit of a baby zone on Saturday mornings, which I don't always look forward to hearing before I've had my coffee. Changing neighborhood I guess."
Snowbird Coffee,"the quality of their latte was great- not too bitter but enough flavor of the coffee.  my only dislike was that there were almost no power outlets except one in the front near the window,  and somewhere in the back that i could not find.   i think i saw it in the back but it was only usb ports."
Snowbird Coffee,"Great coffee and tea, friendly service and a move ambience. There's plenty of seating as it goes back a bit further than some places along this street and there is a restroom. The pastries they have are delicious as well."
Snowbird Coffee,"Really good coffee, but they are closed incredibly frequently. To be fair… the reasons for being closed are always legitimate (I.e. servicing the machines) but it happens with such frequency that I would recommend calling to ensure they are open."
Snowbird Coffee,I keep going back for the smooth tasting coffee. I order 16 ounce black drip every day. Today (10/12) the coffee I got at 10:30 am was lukewarm. Had to pop it into the microwave when I got home. The coffee is $0.50 more than most places. Need it hot. Thanks
Snowbird Coffee,"Great coffee. Came here for the first time a few days ago. The place is very cute and has a decent amount of seating. The cold brew even came with coffee ice cubes. I had a mocha, which was delicious."
Snowbird Coffee,"Really love this place. The specialty coffees are all truly unique and tasty, and overall just has such a good vibe"
Snowbird Coffee,I love it! Extra good local coffee shop on high-quality grains.
Snowbird Coffee,"Outstanding third wave coffee. Excellent espresso drinks, fast service, a great experience."
Snowbird Coffee,It's got a great coffee shop vibe and had some friendly staff welcome us. That's always a good first step in my book. Coffee and tea are good but on the pricey side. That's the only thing preventing this review getting 5 stars.
Snowbird Coffee,"Giving it 5 stars for the great chai oat latte I just ordered. It's a small place so I don't expect to get a seat, but this chai latte is spicy and just the right taste. Not so sweet, and just the right temp!"
Snowbird Coffee,"I guess we stopped in on an off-day. Four staff members behind the counter but it took them twenty minutes to process three orders. They had no pastries when we stopped in (mid day). The atmosphere was too loud inside; it did not help that none of the employees spoke above a whisper when calling out orders. We ordered hot chocolates, but what we got were steamed milks with a sprinkle of cocoa powder on top. It was a dreadful cup and far overpriced for what we received.  I'm not sure why they have mentions and awards. They did not deserve them when we were there."
Snowbird Coffee,"Cool little coffee shop renowned for their great coffee. Staff is always friendly without fail, fast service too."
Snowbird Coffee,"I rarely go out to get coffee when I do Snowbird is a favorite. It small, lightly dim mostly quiet. Feels very much like home. And the employees are always welcoming."
Snowbird Coffee,"Wonderful local coffee shop. The cold brew is great, and every espresso-based drink I have tried has been excellent. Cozy interior and welcoming baristas make it even better."
Snowbird Coffee,The shakerato is fantastic! They also have some of my favourite beans in the city for brewing coffee at home.
Snowbird Coffee,"I Love this little Cafe in The Inner Sunset, on 9th ave. Excellent coffee. Not too far from my house. Cool, clean vibes inside, and nice open outdoor area to enjoy your beverage. The BEST Customer Service!! Knowledgeable,  polite and friendly."
Snowbird Coffee,"Snowbird! Yet ANOTHER coffee spot in this small 2 block area. They're good. Out of all the spots they feel the most ""hand crafted"". I'm not a coffee snob but once in a while this is good. I can't stand being lectured by some about coffee. For me theres good coffee, ok coffee and terrible coffee. I know theyre good I dont need a lesson though. Its also a bit on the expensive side. Great little location though. However I still think its really bizarre to have the cleaning product business in the back. Hope they dont share the same kitchen."
Snowbird Coffee,This was my local coffee hangout for a couple of years while living in inner sunset. Great coffee and the staff are always warm and inviting. Good vibes all around. I always try to make a stop when I’m in the neighborhood.
Snowbird Coffee,"Staff is always super friendly! The Spaniard is my go-to, and their matcha latte is solid too."
Snowbird Coffee,Super cute cafe on 9th between Irving and Judah. Serves up great coffee and has scrumptious looking pastries. I love the seats on the inside. Great place to grab a quick coffee or to stay to lounge.
Snowbird Coffee,It's been a while I've gone back here and don't plan on it again. i've seen bitter employee attitudes/behaviors even to customers. I prefer to go to places in the area with better vibes like Hollow —such a cute place.
Snowbird Coffee,Great coffee and friendly people.  Great espresso with carbonated water!
Snowbird Coffee,Great coffees and great morning bun 🤤 They have some cool looking merch too …
Snowbird Coffee,Love the lattes and pastries. Great place to get some work done too.
Snowbird Coffee,"I waited for 10 minutes with my cappuccino to get a table, outside, in the rain. One opened up, I sat down. Within 10 minutes of sitting down I was rushed out by one of the baristas - who walked over and asked if I was ready to get my next drink ""because it was getting busy."" I apologized and asked if they wanted me to leave or buy something and he just stared at me silently - kind of a weird moment. He repeated that it was getting busy - clearly letting me know that I needed to spend more money or get out.  I understand the need to do this when there are some customers that set up camp and sit all day at a table after ordering a small coffee. I hate when people do this, it drives me crazy. However, I was there for only a few minutes and the same barista that served me my drink was telling me to buy more or leave.  So, I got up and purchased an espresso because it was raining hard and it wasn't that busy (nobody was waiting for tables, contrary to what the barista said).  The coffee was great, but there are plenty of other places that have great coffee that don't rush you out the door like the Snowbird staff. Really disappointed - Snowbird used to be a cool neighborhood coffee place, but now it is turning into another snobby coffee shop."
Snowbird Coffee,"Chill, spacious, friendly, locals spot for good coffee and expresso drinks. Many locals use this as a hangout and the Proprietors really know their customers. Fast for when you're on the run, or lots of space to kick it and chill when you have the time. A favorite."
Snowbird Coffee,"Always good conversation, great coffee and great pastries. Always been a die-hard fan for the brevano... Owners are super nice and very approachable. Wish it was closer to my house."
Snowbird Coffee,"I've generally preferred my espresso-based drinks here over the hand poured, but YMMV. The Shakerato, however, was novel and delish! Definitely worth trying instead of an iced coffee."
Snowbird Coffee,The basic coffee is really watery with a burned flavor. The pastries didn’t impress either.
Snowbird Coffee,Cute cozy shop with a beautiful toile wallpaper accent. They have delicious specialty drinks (like their Spaniard and Brevano) that aren't too sweet but will still satisfy your sweet tooth.
Snowbird Coffee,Unbelievable. The unkempt individual with glasses and the long hair ignored half the customers. He was too intent on looking at his phone. He looked annoyed when asked a question.
Snowbird Coffee,Great coffee. The Spaniard (double espresso with condensed milk and a spoonful of cappuccino foam) is a hangover slayer! Bonus points for being off the beaten path so it is never too busy. Wifi and sockets!
Snowbird Coffee,"At first the environment seems nice (although small). But the staff here are known to have bad characters and the owner seems no better ....  coffees not impressive, theres better options around"
Snowbird Coffee,"A total, random find that did not disappoint. They are small batch roasting their own beans. I had a Guatemalan in a pourover–in the declining age of well executed pourovers, Snowbird stood out. We left with beans to use in our own Chemex."
Snowbird Coffee,"pastries here are dirty. always have bugs in the boxes. and plus they are made by the worst, dirtiest and most disgusting bakery in oakland. ewwww. i dont know how you can eat it. yuck."
Snowbird Coffee,Best espresso I’ve ever had in SF!
Snowbird Coffee,A prime go-to coffee shop for my son and I for our coffee dates. I tend to enjoy the cold brew the most with ice made from coffee so that it doesn't get watered down.
Snowbird Coffee,"What's not to like? It's a cool local, friendly small business with great coffee. If more business were run like this, the US would be a better place. Kudos, Snowbird!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Great coffee, i love their zatara coffee beans"
Snowbird Coffee,"This is the Best coffee in SF, hands down! I'm here at least 3 times a week and the coffee does not disappoint. Great staff too!"
Snowbird Coffee,Great spot in the inner Sunset or need some caffeine while at Golden Gate Park.
Snowbird Coffee,Best local coffee shop! Love the chai latte.
Snowbird Coffee,"Great local coffee shop. Quality pourovers without the pretense. Also really affordable and tasty ""batch"" coffee $2.50 for 16 oz."
Snowbird Coffee,"Very smooth coffee, a blend of dark and medium roast beans. Devil's tooth pastries and today's selection included German apple cake."
Snowbird Coffee,"They can make the chai latte spicier and less sweet, the way a chai should taste, in my opinion"
Snowbird Coffee,Great coffee in a cozy shop off of 9th Ave near Golden Gate Park.  A little pretentious and not good for dieters as they have 4 types of sugar and no non-existent caloric sweetener and no low or low fat milk- bring your own!
Snowbird Coffee,"Good service, a pleasant atmosphere, and deliciously sweet coffee beverages."
Snowbird Coffee,Excellent quality coffee and espresso. Best I’ve found in the inner Sunset area. Several notches above Peet’s and Starbucks.
Snowbird Coffee,Cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Their branding is on point. Latte was delicious and beautifully made. Will definitely come again!
Snowbird Coffee,Everyone who works there is so nice and they make a great cappuccino!
Snowbird Coffee,"Best cappuccino in town, although depends on which barista makes it. I absolutely love their espresso beans and highly recommend them."
Snowbird Coffee,"A very quaint coffee shop with a variety of speciality drinks. A bit pricey, especially considering that they charge 75 cents for a splash of almond milk in cold brew."
Snowbird Coffee,"Owner with glasses was rude, hard to deal with, should not be in service industry. Coffee is bad."
Snowbird Coffee,Solid coffee shop. They freeze cold brew into ice cubes so your drink is never diluted! Great idea!
Snowbird Coffee,"Must have walked in at the wrong time. Guy with glasses, stocking cap, and long black hair behind the counter was literally in a shouting match with some customer. Unprofessional."
Snowbird Coffee,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city (and the world!) Great coffee and friendly baristas. Try an iced Spaniard, especially on a hot day!"
Snowbird Coffee,"Great service and delicious coffee. It can get pretty loud and crowded, though, so it may not always be the best place to study."
Snowbird Coffee,Nice staff and great coffee
Snowbird Coffee,"Had breakfast, which is served all day long...french toast. It was your classic yummy big ole plate of french toast in a timely manner."
Snowbird Coffee,"Great coffee, great pastries (but they run out so fast!). Nice spot in the Inner Sunset."
Snowbird Coffee,well made flat white! would come back if in the area
Snowbird Coffee,Amazing coffee and wonderful atmosphere. A nice place to tuck away and do some reading or drawing. I recommend the Americano.
Snowbird Coffee,"Easy to miss, but now that I've found it I'll almost certainly become a regular as I wait for the morning train. Easily the best coffee in the area."
Snowbird Coffee,"Nice cup of hot chocolate, great people. It's the type of a small friendly coffee shop in a very nice neighborhood"
Snowbird Coffee,Some of the best coffee in the Inner Sunset (easily comparable to good Australian coffee) but you'll pay top dollar for it!
Snowbird Coffee,"Really nice cafe with amazing coffee and pastries. Great place to work, though not that many power outlets."
Snowbird Coffee,Good Macchiato and the Brevano is a tasty sweet option. WiFi wouldn't work and they offered to restart the router for me.
Snowbird Coffee,"One of my favorite cafe in SF, good latte, good staff, special and cool logo of the snowbird as well!"
Snowbird Coffee,Great coffee and the best green tea matcha lattes! Always fantastic staff too :)
Snowbird Coffee,A very cool coffee shop in the sunset.

Snowbird Coffee,Great coffee and very nice Service. On the weekends is also a natural soap shop.

Snowbird Coffee,"there is this handsome Meditarrenean piece of ""man candy,"" that makes his everything Extra Delicious, ask for anything and he will make it so, want a dragon in your latte art?"
Snowbird Coffee,"Great coffee, good price and excellent service! Thank you, again."
Snowbird Coffee,Cute little spot for coffee or tea. Not a ton of seating but turnover seemed good. Cozy.
Snowbird Coffee,There is no better location for their excellent coffee: just across the street from Arizmendi and around the corner from the doughnut shop. ;)
Snowbird Coffee,"Decent coffee, they tend to burn it. For the price, and by San Francisco standards, it’s on the lower end of middle of the road."
Snowbird Coffee,"Nice intimate atmosphere, with a pleasantly simple interior - highly recommend (and great coffee!)"
Snowbird Coffee,Good place for small or solo bands. The pace is relaxed. Local feel of the neighborhood.
Snowbird Coffee,Popped in for a great macchiato. I appreciate that one of the staffers wore a Leonard’s Bakery tee.
