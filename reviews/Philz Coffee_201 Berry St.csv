Philz Coffee,"Between the music, street noise and chatter this is not the most quiet place to work but the excellent Tesora coffee helps make up for it.  I appreciate the many outlets they offer to their customers & all the local art over every wall.  This Philz draws a long line very quickly however the staff remain friendly and hospitable despite the spikes.  Strong security and police presence provides additional feeling of safety despite this being a very inner city neighborhood.  Noted for great craft coffee and outlet access"
Philz Coffee,"Had to try it out. I’m not sure it’s because I had high expectations for everything because it was for the first time in 4 years visiting the States or it was just a mediocre coffee house…  Mint mojito coffee (hot) - Weak tasting coffee. No aroma. I was expecting something really refreshing or a bit festive as it says “mint mojito” coffee. Not my liking.  I don’t know what all the fuss is about…  Such a shame. Cashier was really friendly and sweet, the vibe at the coffee house was quite nice though.  Note: takes a while to get your coffee"
Philz Coffee,"This place sells coffee, but that is an understatement. They sell lots of brewed coffee (no espresso). Pick your beans, and then the size of cup. I did not realize how this worked, but they delivered an excellent cup of coffee, so my ineptitude was overcome by their product. Would definitely recommend if you want excellent coffee"
Philz Coffee,"I would like to bring this coffee shop to my hometown. I’m in love with Mint Mojito. If you’re going there with your own cup you can get a discount. The atmosphere for this place is amazing, the staff is kind and you can just stay there enjoy a different  & funny coffee!"
Philz Coffee,"It's a very cool coffee shop with some hipster vibes. :) It was highly recommended by many friends, so I decided to give it a try. I don't regret it! :) We had two delicious cold coffees: Mint Mojito and Ice Coffee Rosé. Very tasty and good combination! Also, we ate a croissant with almonds and a blueberry muffin. They offer to heat the food if you want. Both pastries were very good! The service is quick and the line goes fast, so try to decide what you want to order when your time comes. The staff doesn't offer much explanation if you don't know the details. #tip: I noticed it's possible to order via app being at the store and just pick up it at the counter when it's ready. I didn't try yet, but saw many people ordering this way. The store is very spacious with tables, chairs, small sofas, and some armchairs to get comfortable. I liked the experience and would come back easily. The entrance is compatible with wheelchair users and they offer all-gender bathroom."
Philz Coffee,"What a great find!  I love coffee. I'm not a connoisseur but I know what I like.  After asking the barista about his favorite coffee, he pointed me to the ""Jacob's Wonderbar"" darker roast coffee. It was incredibly smooth with a light chocolate undertone. All I can say is, Wow.  I'm buying the beans online so I can relive that experience at home.  Incredibly friendly staff, casual and comfy interior... Just a great vibe while enjoying my coffee."
Philz Coffee,"Cute little coffee shop with great coffee, friendly service and a well-kept, cool little shop. The mismatched furniture was far from detriment, in fact it made the whole place homey and neat. I didn't stay but waiting for my coffee was relaxing and nice. My mocha did not disappoint and neither did the beans I brought home to my husband!"
Philz Coffee,Best coffee I ever tasted! So rich and creamy and flavourful! It’s hard to go back to normal coffee once you’ve tasted it!
Philz Coffee,"Looks great inside. Nice and spacious. However.... never before have I ever seen multiple sets of people order and receive their stuff before we could get a simple Chai Tea. I had to remind the barista 4x to hurry up. I told them we've been waiting now 20 minutes for a simple tea to be then mansplained ""We have a system for these thing. These teas take time""... a Chai tea.... taking 30 minutes in the end is absurd. Finally I had enough and said please make that tea next we have stuff to do only to have him let me know several times that ""we do our Chai tea differently and you might not like it with how you ordered it."" It's chai tea. Make my tea and let me leave. This could have been done in 5 minutes. Instead I was rudely helped and told I'm.wrong for knowing this isn't a drink that takes half an hour to make. Never will return."
Philz Coffee,"This is my first time at Philz Coffee. I ordered an Iced Mocha, a Mint Mojito Iced Coffee and a Banana Bread. Great place, great coffee, great service, nice baristas and lots of seating."
Philz Coffee,"Wow! This place is so amazing, the coffee here is so amazing. The whole coffee shop itself has such a unique vibe! So staff here were the sweetest ever!"
Philz Coffee,"I love, love, love mint Mojito iced coffee; so refreshingly wonderful! And I'm having as many as I can as I don't get Philz where I'm from. Spacious venue with reasonable amount of seating area. Staff are pretty friendly and helpful. The surrounding neighbourhood feels a bit rough though."
Philz Coffee,"I love the coffee and tea here, but be ready to wait 10-25 minutes for your order. I always order from the app, and still is like 15-20 minutes the wait :(."
Philz Coffee,"Sweet Rose, Gingersnap and Philtered salt all delicious! Great coffee!"
Philz Coffee,This coffee is worth it to miss the taxi and take the subway.
Philz Coffee,This place takes forever to do anything. Every time I come here the employees have zero urgency and are not organized. Mobile orders are a joke when they’re ready 10 minutes after the assigned time to pick it up.
Philz Coffee,I ordered 3 iced drinks. It took 40 minutes and the iced mochas were disgusting sludge at the bottom of the cup. The staff served several customers that ordered after I had placed my order before they entered. I was ignored. The batista didn't want her coworker to open another bar so I was just waiting. She then said sorry for the wait I am brewing your drinks. The iced mocha is made with pre-brewed coffee. I  won't go back drink quality is in the basement and customer service doesn't exist. Way to expensive to be that unsatisfactory.
Philz Coffee,"Love their Hot Cocoa, sweetened to order. The casual seating is very relaxing without loud music. Can spend hours chatting or surfing"
Philz Coffee,Iced mint mohitto and cinamon sugar toast is incredible! And I love this place wide and spacious so that I feel comfortable. Another good point is not asking the password for wifi.
Philz Coffee,Great spot but their bagels really hard to chew
Philz Coffee,Pro: Location/ Taste. This will be a simple review. I ordered the Herbal Mint and it was delicious. I had four of those. The fresh mint was the best.
Philz Coffee,Good store and friendly staff. It can get very backed up in the mornings so be prepared to wait 15-20 mins for your coffee. Not the baristas fault but the management should add another barista probably
Philz Coffee,The only way a coffee ☕ shop gets 5 stars * Has WiFi * Has outlets for computers * Has indoor seating * Has public clean restrooms At a minimum
Philz Coffee,"We’re on a road trip from the Midwest and had a friend recommend Phil’s Coffee. When I looked it up, I was thinking this would be a standard chain coffee place, BUT ITS NOT! This is the only place I’ve ever seen that pays such close attention to the uniqueness and notes of each bean. Make sure to get it “Phil’s way”, not too sweet.. 👌🏼ask for Nicole, she was awesome and so so helpful!!"
Philz Coffee,"My two favorite iced coffees: the mint mojito and rose cream are from Philz. I typically make my coffee every morning at home, but when I feel like a delicious, refreshing pick me up, I order on the app and pick up my coffee a happy camper. The customer service is always excellent, and I love that their cups, lids and straws are completely compostable! The price is right, and I love purchasing from a company that actually practices green initiative"
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee is great as always, be ready to wait longer then approximated time in mobile app. Highly recommend tantalizing Turkish, very nice taste of mint , tobacco and dark caramel in one cup. Amazing."
Philz Coffee,"The bigger they get, the lower the quality. Philz use to be a treat but it’s becoming just another corp focused on “scale.”  More pre-made items, more slap dash drinks, and baristas pretending to be special and experts but the coffee says otherwise. Starbucks Jr with extra attitude I’m sad to say."
Philz Coffee,Love Philz Coffee! Lovely and warm people in the town!
Philz Coffee,Soooo good. Amazing coffee and pastries. I love the Philtered Soul and my husband got Tessora and loved it. the bagel and banana bread were also exceptional. We will be back!
Philz Coffee,Very good coffee and food options. Free wifi and plugs available
Philz Coffee,Bad experience. This was my first time visiting San Francisco and decided to come to Philz Coffee. The worker taking care of my pick up order was rude. He said my name wrong and made me prove my order in a disrespectful way. I am very upset about this experience.
Philz Coffee,I think I like the atmosphere more than Starbucks!
Philz Coffee,"My first time trying Philz. Ordered the Rosé coffee and absolutely no regrets. It was so creamy, sweet and floral. Really really good! I'm not a big fan of Philz. The customer service was super great. The barista was very friendly and made sure we absolutely loved our drinks. Love this place."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee tastes great here. This place is for everyone, but the menu makes it easy for aficionados to order the exact flavor that they desire. They are listed by roast and then a description is given of each blend.  The chai is very tasty. My favorite coffee blend is Philtered Soul. I also like their Mocha Tesora drink."
Philz Coffee,"Philz is my weakness. If there's one in my time of desperation, it's my oasis in the 🏜🏝 fuh sho. I haven't been to the original spot on 24th and Folsom in years. I hope they ALL remain open. It's not exactly the same Turkish African blends he started out with there, but still the best cuppa in the region IMHO! CHEERS!"
Philz Coffee,"The coffee is tasty. But they might quote you 10 minutes but it actually takes 30. But that’s your problem. Or the other way around, but also your problem. Philz may accept your money and your order even though the store is physically closed, but also your problem. You see…Philz is hip and chill, and things like actually aligning service to what’s promised doesn’t matter when you’re hip and chill."
Philz Coffee,Just picked up a Too Good To Go
Philz Coffee,Ambiance  is good . Coffee is mediocre. Sorry
Philz Coffee,"Excellent coffee and the service, at every point was competent and happy! Highly recommended!"
Philz Coffee,"When it comes to coffee, SF always has so much to offer. I love coming to philz because the staff here is so nice and welcoming. I really like their cold brew but my usual is the Philz iced tea with cream and sugar, the pop of mint really makes the drink."
Philz Coffee,Delicious coffee maker individually from scratch. Only complaint is moderate wait.
Philz Coffee,"At Philz Coffee when you order one or their many house coffees, you need not worry about getting coffee that is cold or coffee that has been burned because it's been for the last few hours.  They will grind coffee beans and then brew the coffee just for your order.  Then, if you specify, they will add sugar and milk (or almond, soy, or oat milk if you prefer).  It will take a few minutes longer to prepare your order than a standard coffee store, but what you get will be the freshest coffee you have ever had and it will be made exactly as you specify.  They take Covid seriously and always wear gloves and masks while making or serving your coffee.  If you love coffee, you haven't had really great fresh coffee if you havent, had Philz."
Philz Coffee,"Awesome coffee!! One of my favs in the world. I like the unique taste. This coffee is no standard, this is made with passion. I do love the ones with the mint leave in it. Ever since I tasted it, I prepare my coffee at home like that. But you can't compare it with Philz. I warmly recommend Philz to all those coffee fanatics out there."
Philz Coffee,women who works there at 5pm on sundays is awful. she 1. rushes you so much. 2. i asked for decaf and she didn’t give me anything close to that. 3. is just plain rude.
Philz Coffee,Pros: Gluten Free brownies Great (all) coffee for less than 5 bucks Friendly staff Quick AF service  Cons: No hand sanitizer
Philz Coffee,"This is THE WORST coffee shop I have been to ever! The customer service is despicable! First of all they don't wait, they demand you place your order before you have selected your drink.  They are very rude and phycologically abusive. They act like YOU are working for them instead of the other way around!  Then there is the constant very LOUD banging, clanging noise going on when they are preparing the coffee, it's not a relaxing environment on top of the very loud music playing in the background probably in an attempt to cover up all the constant banging and clanging going on where people are forced to talk over the noise, creating a even more deafening environment!  And their prices are too high and their drinks are smaller than Starbucks, and they don't put lids or straws in your drinks, perhaps this is why they think you work for them instead of the other way around!  How anyone can buy their coffee/drinks here is beyond my comprehension!  If you want good service and a relaxing quiet environment don't buy your coffee here!  If you do decide to buy your coffee here please bring your ear plugs and save your ears, sanity and your peace of mind!"
Philz Coffee,Love this spot and love the coffees and we only buy our ungrounded coffee beans from here now ever since we found their hazelnut flavored beans
Philz Coffee,The coffee was good as always. I had a mint mojito iced coffee. The barista was nice and patient as were trying to figure out our order and she even gave us suggestions. The shop was clean with a good amount of people sitting around on their phone/laptop.
Philz Coffee,Amazing coffee! Baristas were so nice and helpful since this was my first time going
Philz Coffee,I love Philz coffee. I'm going to get two packs of whole bean for my family in Korea
Philz Coffee,"This place is the best!! Extremely polite employees! It's always clean, even the bathroom that they allow ANYONE to use, unlike almost every other restaurants/coffee shop in SF!  They allow ANYONE to use the many convenient outlets and charging stations, yet again unlike other coffee shops, especially located in the Tenderloin. I believe, due to the friendly, respectable demeanor of it's employees and the way they treat ALL PEOPLE the way that everyone should treat one another, as equals and without judgement, is the exact reason as to why they can allow to offer these simple, convenient, yet extremely needed amenities that so many other stores/restaurants refuse to offer.  San Francisco as a whole could learn a lot from this philz location in particular."
Philz Coffee,Interesting take on breakfast with a cucumber toast. It tasted much better than I imagined. Cozy coffee shop.
Philz Coffee,Excellent made to order pour over coffee
Philz Coffee,"Spacious, comfortable, laid back cafe, with distinctive beverages. I'm a tea drinker, so can't comment on coffee, but the tea is robust and each cup prepared by hand, good for fueling an hour's reading and writing. The baristas are friendly; the cafe's decor is bright and cheerful but not overwhelming. This is just a good place to hang out and get stuff done."
Philz Coffee,I had a very bad experience at this coffee bar on Monday 10/17 In the late afternoon. I had to wait more than 30 minutes to get my drink.
Philz Coffee,"My new favorite coffee! Seriously one of the best coffees I've ever had. They made it EXACTLY like I like it. I had Tesora, medium cream and light honey. PERFECTION!!! Thank you Phil, for pursuing EXCELLENCE. :D You def brightened my day. Now if only you would open one near me."
Philz Coffee,"Mint mojito coffee all the way!!! I think you can only get this in San Francisco so make sure you give it a try. The mint makes the coffee so refreshing it's crazy! But beware that it's heavy and can feel almost like a meal (which isn't a bad thing). So delightfully tasty, it's incredible.  This particular cafe is in the Tenderloin district so beware of your surroundings though nothing much to worry about during the day.  Accessibility: entrance is wide enough for those on wheelchairs and tables are of a good height. However, the ordering place is quite high so it can be difficult for anyone who isn't tall and the menu can be a bit hard to see as well.  Otherwise, friendly staff and a chill atmosphere."
Philz Coffee,The coffee (I got an iced Gingersnap) and  pastry I got were absolutely lovely and the staff was friendly. The nutrition informs was also clearly listed. The interior design could use some work—lots of echo and not as comfy as it could’ve been. But overall the pros greatly outweigh the cons—I would go again.
Philz Coffee,"Philz is always one of my go-to places for coffee and this location doesn't disappoint. The staff is friendly and attentive and prepares your coffee order within minutes. They are very busy in the morning or just after lunch though. If you want to come meet a friend for coffee or do some work on your laptop, there are tons of tables and chairs available."
Philz Coffee,Good coffee and very nice service.
Philz Coffee,Some of the best Coffee drinks in the City. The Croissants are outstanding when heated up.
Philz Coffee,"The drinks aside from coffee are not good, so avoid those.  The selection of allergen friendly food (plant based and gluten free) could use some work.  The vibe is nice and the quality of coffee, high."
Philz Coffee,I do not get the high score of this place. I thought it was terribly subpar. They took our order incorrectly and then was indifferent about it. The coffee took too long to make and its taste was just average.
Philz Coffee,"Location is close to Civic Center. Makes it easy to get to. Big store with good baristas. Doesn't look like their new locations which too hipster clean, but instead have that SF charm. Wait time is a little long, but you get that at any coffee place in the city. The quality of their drinks are the same as other Philz locations."
Philz Coffee,The Philtz on Golden Gate Avenue has excellent Customer Service; especially Ed who was very courteous and helpful in helping choose my coffee which I'm not savvy in.
Philz Coffee,"The staff always go out of their way to ensure that your drink is exactly as you wish. They also have tasty hot chocolate, but their tea menu is very sparse. If you want a great tea selection, you'll be happier at Pete's"
Philz Coffee,Philz iced coffee silken splendor is the bestest in the westest!
Philz Coffee,"Love there coffee and staff... usually. Unfortunately today the woman was visibly annoyed that I ordered food at the register, I guess cus she has to make the bagel herself. And then to make things worse she gave me the wrong bagel but I wasn't about to ask her to remake it, plus I didn't have time at that point anyways. I understand if your short staffed, it can get stressful but at least be decent to customers."
Philz Coffee,"Never had it, and now we don't want to drink anything else!!! Wish we had one by us! Be here almost every day!!!!!! Not to mention, went here 1 day, nicest gentleman in the world assisted us! Remembered us when we came back, and what we ordered last time! Dude should be running a Lawyer Firm somewhere!!! Very Impressed!"
Philz Coffee,Great great coffee not always open like it's supposed to be but they got great coffee it's sometimes even stronger than the dope that I do you know lol.
Philz Coffee,Good coffee! I love Iced Coffee Rose. This is the best coffee I’ve ever tried :)
Philz Coffee,"Visiting from Cleveland, arrived 45 minutes before closing (so no wait) -  superbly flavored coffee, hand poured by very friendly staff.  Just a delightful way to bridge a late afternoon visit to the Asian Art Museum to my 6:30 dinner.  Highly recommended"
Philz Coffee,"Worst Phill’s manager I’ve even seen, this man was plain out rude though the entire transaction. I’ve never had a manger deal with customers in a more unprofessional conduct. He refused to make the coffee I order it, then gave me a hassle when trying to pick it up! I would stay away for your own sake."
Philz Coffee,"Good service, worst coffee I had🤷‍♂️ …"
Philz Coffee,friendly cosy place to enjoy great coffee here.
Philz Coffee,"Very good coffee, places to plug in your phone or laptop. Limited outside seating. My Barista was radiant. Nice modern Folk music, a little loud. Pet friendly."
Philz Coffee,We went there around 6 PM yesterday and there was no queue. There were 2 Baristas and each of them had a special name what people call them. After waiting for a couple of minutes we gave our orders and paid. This place is huge so you can hangout and also work if you want. Our drinks were ready in about 5-7 minutes after we ordered and they were perfect. My Chat Latte was made spicy and creamy and it also had mint to take it up one level.
Philz Coffee,Best coffee in town. They use heavy whipping cream and offer some coffees that definitely provide a good kick in the pants. Ether is not for a weak heart. Jacobs Wonderbar is my favorite. Can get busy at times. Staff is pretty friendly. The toast with avocado and hard boiled egg is very good too.
Philz Coffee,"Signage was small so it was difficult to find that way, but good location on a corner. Plenty of large tables for groups plus smaller individual tables. Long counter with lots of approachable staff. Quick checkout. Average pricing for San Francisco. I had a hot chocolate, which was good. Supplies were plentiful. Did not check out the bathroom."
Philz Coffee,Great place with friendly staff and Philz has a vast choice for type of coffee but bare in mind that the only do drip coffee and no espresso drinks. Try blending multiple coffee types based on Barista's recommendation it is usually great.
Philz Coffee,"One of my favorite Philz locations in San Francisco. Staff is friendly, the coffee is amazing as always and the interior is bright with lots of seating. Also a really fun place to people watch or read a book."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee is delicious; the staff is friendly and fun; and the cafe food is good. It's ever so slightly pricier than the other cafes in the area, but the quality can be worth it. This is also a great spot to recharge and get some work done."
Philz Coffee,"Philz is a truly hand crafted experience unlike any other coffee shop in SF. It's not fancy, there's no latte art, and skinny isn't on the menu. Instead, what you get is a flavorful cup of coffee from Philz vast menu of (mostly) post-roast blends. The warm and nutty Tesora is by far the most popular, but I absolutely love Turkish. Get a mint leaf and a bit of cream. The best."
Philz Coffee,Interesting choices of coffee with all different types of coffee. It was hard choosing what type but they all seem to be fantastic choices. The coffee taste is unique from other cafés. They setup is really relaxed from couches to tables.
Philz Coffee,"This location is new and has many seats and couches. I like how it is spacious. The baristas here are as wonderful as the original Philz Coffee in the Mission area. Since it was in the morning, I didn't want to get the usual (Mint Mojito). I couldn't decide what hot drink I wanted.  The barista recommend me the Tesora. I don't like Caramel so I chose philtered soul instead. He was super patient waiting for me to decide what I want and he was friendly!  In my opinion, I feel like this location doesn't make their coffee as strong as the Mission location & the Van Ness location, which I'm grateful for. I love Philz Coffee, but my coffee tolerance isn't as high, but this particular location is my now go-to-spot for  Philz Coffee!"
Philz Coffee,My 1st pour over coffee. It's different but good. Very friendly staffs
Philz Coffee,"Terribly confusing service! Boutique drip-only coffee joint, which is all and well albeit ill-advertized. We paid and one of the orders in our party was lost all together. Waited nearly 20 for a cold pastry and a pour over. Seems to be a local staple, but would not recommend."
Philz Coffee,"Philz is the best coffee in the city. What makes it the best is their coffees are highlighted with their distinct flavors and their baristas know how to add cream and sugar perfectly.  I usually like to try new things, but the Philtered Soul is just my go-to here. I'd definitely give it a try if you haven't already."
Philz Coffee,Best coffee ever!!! Mint mojito is the one you should try.
Philz Coffee,"Can't ever go wrong with a fresh ground, freshly brewed coffee, served perfectly to your liking from Philz. Their serving standards are on point, and the order app is super helpful for those on the go!"
Philz Coffee,"Philz is serious about coffee. They ask you to wait patiently while methodically creating your perfect pour over. They ask you take a sip before you leave the counter, ""to make sure it's perfect."" They ask you if you want free mint.  What they won't ask you to do is speed it up so don't ask them. Just relax, breathe in the perfect coffee air and wait."
Philz Coffee,Excellent customer service and I appreciate how everything is so fresh. I recommend the Rose coffee.
Philz Coffee,Iced Mint mojito with 1 spoon of sugar 👍👍 …
Philz Coffee,"I love coffee! Especially here. The customer service is awesome and mornings are really pleasant in philz atmosphere It's where a welcoming ""Good Morning!"" Feels natural."
Philz Coffee,"I can't remember having so many choices with freshly brewed coffee. Fantastic. Staff were friendly and are patient with tourists. It's a SF chain, but great coffee and I'll be back to buy a bag of coffee before I leave."
Philz Coffee,"Busy and over rated. If you like to wait 20 minutes among a crowd of hipsters while your barista makes a cup of coffee from scratch, then this is your place. The coffee is great though."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee's great but the wait is way too long.  I know . . . I know . . . I could ""go online and call it in ahead"" or ""use the app"".  But that's of no use when just deciding right then to get a cup of coffee.  The people working there are very nice, polite, friendly, and courteous."
Philz Coffee,"This is the third Philz I have been to, and is definitely the best - it is much more spacious than the ones in San Jose and Sunnyvale, has more cool furniture, but has the same great coffee selection and relaxed atmosphere as in their other locations."
Philz Coffee,My favorite coffee chain since discovered about ten years ago!! Discover your favorite roast and hope you like it sweet & creamy? Just light creme? All good!
Philz Coffee,"A lot of my friends have jumped on the Phil's band Wagon.   You get a line,  any line as you're reading their menu of coffee and different flavors,  notes,  origin of beans. ..  You order your coffee telling them how much cream and level of sweetness.  Each cup is made to order as the batista folks the cone shape filter with beans and hot water. I can't say it's the best darn cup of coffee I've had but it was good."
Philz Coffee,"There is no way to describe a cup of Philz coffee that can compensate for that first experience when you go in and order a Philharmonic. The intriguing names and descriptions of the blends, the time spent on each single-pour cup, the presentation as baristas boldly make pours from far over their heads. A cup of Philz coffee is simply a different experience than any other cup of coffee. My personal favorite is the Dancing Water, but its hard to wrong."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, crowded/popular location! Helpful/patient staff and trendy crowd."
Philz Coffee,"Personal poured cups. Phillz has a great selection of blends and different grinds. Every cup is personally poured, sugar, cream or other additions like cinnamon, brown sugar or mint are added by the baristas however you order it. One of my favorite ways to start the morning."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, delicious vegan bagels, and friendly staff.  The only other Philz I've been to is the one on Van Ness.  This one on Golden Gate caters to to UC Hastings crowd, at least that's how I feel.  It has couches and has lots of outlets.  And I have to say, I really like the music that plays here."
Philz Coffee,"Philz Coffee is amazing. I love the flavors imparted by the one cup / pour over method. My only issue is with the lines sometimes in the mornings, but the best comes to those who wait. ☕️"
Philz Coffee,"Freindly warm feeling coffee shop where people gather to work or just hang out. Great baristas and most importantly, coffee that will change your life! Philz also has a great selection of quick bites and really delicious baked goods. Any Philz location would definitely hit that itchy spot."
Philz Coffee,"Very good coffee.  Walkable from the Tenderloin and Civil Center districts.  The seating area and the general interior planning is off a bit, though. It may be that Philz's is trying to show its ""liberalism?"""
Philz Coffee,"DRINK: everyone knows the coffees here are tasty and strong and the special drink is the mint mojito ;) And the pastries are usually good, as I've gotten the quiches heated up before. And if for some reason you are abstaining from caffeine at the most popular coffee place, then there are also healthful Odwalla smoothies mmm!  SERVICE: Philz workers always nice  ATMOSPHERE: This is my favorite Philz out of all of them. Most cafe lounge feel, clean open, spacious... The only thing is, it's in the middle of the ghetto Tenderloin."
Philz Coffee,"You can't go wrong with Philz. The mojito coffee is perfectly smooth, perfectly sweet, and just plain delicious. Smalls taste better than larges for some reason."
Philz Coffee,I really like the caffeine free mint tea with honey and cream. An excellent alternative to coffee.  If you bring your own container the price is considerably lower.
Philz Coffee,Kind staffs with nice atomosphere. Delicious coffee!!
Philz Coffee,The manager is low-class trash and should not have a job. Also- check your order because everything will be wrong and they will refuse you a refund.
Philz Coffee,Amazing coffee and staff. My first time to this coffee shop the staff were super friendly and helped me pick a coffee based on my tastes. The staff are always friendly and more than willing to help. My go to drink is the mint mojito
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, friendly baristas, plenty of seating at tables, couches with coffee tables and stools at a bar along with lots of outlets to charge phones and laptops. Light breakfast and snacks as well, all menu items are a bit pricey and expect a wait for the bathroom."
Philz Coffee,"Daniel in the AM is either stoned or just not all the way there, but the dude can barely speak let alone take an order and keep it straight."
Philz Coffee,"Philz (Larkin/McAllister) Coffee was mediocre. The ppl energy was good, but baristas were like the coffee, just ""eh"". That's what happens when you franchise I guess. I recommend the ones on 24th /Folsom or in Oakland."
Philz Coffee,"I wish Philz would open a location in the Financial District! I have random cravings for the mint mojito coffee, but there are no locations within walking distance. They also need more locations in the East Bay for non-work days. I like this location because it's usually not overcrowded, is roomy, and the baristas are usually quick and friendly. I always get the mint mojito because it's just so yummy. I have to get the larger size because the smaller one just disappears too quickly. When I want a hot drink, I'll turn to the Tesora."
Philz Coffee,"Great music, great service and both tasty and bold coffee!"
Philz Coffee,"Thia is the best coffee in the Bay Area. Gormet coffee in which you will get a boost of liveliness from the copious amounts of caffeine. I suggest the Philharmonic (comes with mint) or the Philtered Soul. Delicious the ""Philz way""(with cream and brown sugar.)"
Philz Coffee,"More relax , hv more s’est at this located, nice music"
Philz Coffee,"Raving Philz fan here. As with all Philzs, the Civic Center location is busy and crowded. There is always a line and this one has a lot of ""leather"" chairs and outdoor wooden chairs. It does take a while to get a cup of coffee here. Has an interesting vibe - city workers, students, tech workers, locals living in the neighborhood and newbies (trying to figure out what to get). Wifi can be slow - lots of people here are on laptops, phones and a few iPads. Like always, the baristas here are friendly, helpful and willing to walk you through the coffee menu and ask you about cream and sugar preferences. Here was my first experience with Sooo Good with mint, medium cream, light sugar."
Philz Coffee,Great space. Staff was super friendly.
Philz Coffee,"I love my Philz. The app works great and my coffee is ready when I get there. Also, I’m addicted to the labneh toast on soft sourdough bread and dusted with za’atar."
Philz Coffee,I love the coffee! The people are super friendly. My only complaint is this location needs to get the bacon and cheddar scones and it would be perfect!
Philz Coffee,Philz Coffee is hella good. Get the mint mojito with the fresh mint leaves. I went with hot instead of iced. The only thing is that the mint leaves float to the top so you'll be drinking the mojito and all of a sudden you've got a mint leaf in your mouth.
Philz Coffee,"Philz is one of my favorite coffee chains in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.  This new location at Golden Gate and Larkin is likely one of the larger spaces compared to most of the other  Philz locations.  The Mission and Palo Alto being two other large spaces.  Plenty of tables and local artwork on the wall, this Philz is within walking distance of Civic Center.  The staff is really friendly and on the 2 occasions I've been there have been a delight to chat with."
Philz Coffee,"Since covid-19 came out everybody has to wait in the line outside the front door making the wait times much longer but overall the experience was wonderful, staff werr great and the coffee is still top notch."
Philz Coffee,I had a Mojito coffee if you like mint it is definitely a must-have the atmosphere is great nice and friendly staff and Lounge and bathrooms also very clean I recommend it to all coffee lovers
Philz Coffee,Excellent coffee place with fantastic traditional drip coffee and a ton of amazing specialty coffees like the mint mojito coffee (it tastes much better than it sounds). This location is in a bit of a sketch location but I still went back twice in a couple days.
Philz Coffee,Terrible. With almost no people it took 30 min to get a cup of coffee that cost $6 for a small cup! There’s wasn’t even that many people in there
Philz Coffee,...I'm not a big fan of their coffee. I'd rather have Starbucks.  M.W
Philz Coffee,"My drink of choice is an unsweetened hot chocolate, which not every place can do, because they use a syrup or mix. Philz uses actual cocoa, and even unsweetened, their hot chocolate is delicious!"
Philz Coffee,"I'm a caffeine addict. It's how I got through high school, college, and basically how I function. While I do love my Starbucks (I know, I know...but I like my triple grande toffee nut latte!) THIS COMPLETELY OWNS ANY OTHER COFFEE I'VE EVER HAD.  Four words: MINT MOJITO ICED COFFEE. I get giddy just thinking about it."
Philz Coffee,Kind of expensive but tasty tasty coffee one cup at a time. But I live in San Francisco and I'm poor so everything is expensive
Philz Coffee,#1 Best coffee shop in San Francisco. If you like it strong. They don't have any in NYC. They should open one soon.
Philz Coffee,Best place they got a bathroom for customers which is rare in the city 😂 I'd recommend this place if you get off on Civic Center Bart …
Philz Coffee,"Starbucks is the defacto coffee house, Peet's is good but Philz Coffee is where you go for a delicious cup of creative brew.  You will not be disappointed."
Philz Coffee,Great local coffe house! I'm at the one on Golden Gate near the Federal building. Very nice servers and lots of seating. Comfortable sofas and tables.
Philz Coffee,The coffee was delectable as always and the staff were very helpful. Aaron gave excellent recommendations!
Philz Coffee,"Recommended by our Airbnb host, Roberto. Best coffee I’ve had in quite some time. Puts Seattle coffee to shame."
Philz Coffee,I love this place. Coffee is one of the bests I tried in this city. The Mint Mojito iced coffee is what they do best. Service is also friendly and excellent!
Philz Coffee,"One of my most favorite coffee shops in San Francisco. Though it's not on the menu, I like to have Hot Coffee Rose. Should come here again."
Philz Coffee,"Good coffee, pastries, wifi, service, and COVID safety enforcement! All the things needed for a good cafe experience nowadays."
Philz Coffee,Very nice cafe. The service staff is very enthusiastic and attentive. Every morning I often stop by this cafe to have coffee and watch people walk on the street.
Philz Coffee,Different. Very nice atmosphere. Great service and coffee. I was even given a free baklava as a welcoming gift for my first visit. 👍🏿 …
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee is one of the best coffee shops in the bay area. Always a great experience hanging out in there shops and this one is no different. Awesome staff, great coffee."
Philz Coffee,Ho hum... Meh... It's a coffee house that's big and crowded. If you need a policeman chances are you can find one there. Don't use the ATMs across the street cuz there a havens for crack dealers.
Philz Coffee,Great coffee and fast service. No espresso drinks. The mojito coffee is amazing if you like sweet and minty!
Philz Coffee,Costumer service is poor .. but product is tasty
Philz Coffee,Nightmare hipster hellscape. Coffee is good. Horribly unfriendly and unhelpful front end staff. But hey if you like waits and watching them talking to each other 👍👍 …
Philz Coffee,They brew each cup per order. Very fresh and taste very good. Way better than Starbucks/peet
Philz Coffee,First time at Philz and I love it...they have the best vegan brownies and their iced gingerbread coffee is delicious
Philz Coffee,"The ecstatic iced coffee is a really great drink. Staff are really friendly and helpful, the the general ambiance is really relaxed and open."
Philz Coffee,"Very relaxed, but the creamy chai I ordered didn't taste all that creamy. Also, mint leaves in a chai just taste plain weird."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, all windows around the outside so great lighting, always busy though so hard to find seating and in a rough area."
Philz Coffee,Mint mojito was awesome!!! I loved it!!
Philz Coffee,Baristas are friendly but real and quality is consistent with the several other Philz locations I've been to.
Philz Coffee,"Good coffee but really, no coffee is worth $3.50. And for a small cup? Not again unless I really, really have to pee."
Philz Coffee,One of my favorite coffee spots. I really enjoy a cup of Philz Coffee. Ginger snap extra creamy is my favorite.
Philz Coffee,"Large pour over of Philtered Soul with toasted bacon onion croissant. Superb! Love and Passion continues with a ambiance of fellow humans of all kinds, yet one kind!"
Philz Coffee,Best coffee experience so far during our visit...like it better than Blue Bottle
Philz Coffee,Great space in the Civic Center. Super friendly and helpful staff. Delicious coffee. Philz' is a San Francisco institution!
Philz Coffee,Friendliness  and a relaxed  atmosphere  makes  this the place  for study and work.  Over 20 coffees to choose  from:  I recommend  JULIE'S
Philz Coffee,Just a great coffee shop. Nowhere else has this taste. Very helpful and energetic staff.
Philz Coffee,Another good coffee house but the atmosphere was not the best to me.
Philz Coffee,There's always not enough seats during the weekends. Go here to get your dose of Philz Coffee. Try the Philharmonic or the Sooo Good.
Philz Coffee,Friendly professional staff who really know how to make a quality cup of coffee. Without the attitude you can get at other places.
Philz Coffee,Never got my order right time after time frustrating.
Philz Coffee,"One of my favorite Philz location, consistent coffee across all the baristas and the bagel bar is nice extra."

Philz Coffee,Wanna wait in one line to order for 15min and then another line to pay for 10?  Then get a modest cup of product?  Then come to Philz!

Philz Coffee,"Has coffee. Plays Drake, Kanye, Kendrick, Travis Scott. Would recommend."

Philz Coffee,"The mint mojito taste and aroma were special. Recommended for those who like mint. Americano also had a savory aroma and taste, so it suited my taste buds."
Philz Coffee,"Very good coffee, made with a particular method ground at the moment. The area is not very nice, but you can take away from the café."
Philz Coffee,"Mint Mojito Coffee is really unique and delicious! Even I, who don't like mint and coffee, really enjoyed it! The staff are also very friendly!  I only walked for a few minutes, but Golden Gate Avenue felt really dangerous. If you want to walk, use another road!"
Philz Coffee,Mint Mojit Coffee! It seems that there is only an ice menu. It is more like a real mojito than a mint latte. The atmosphere is good too.
Philz Coffee,friends who like to drink coffee You can consider this chain coffee shop I think their coffee is better than Starbucks~~~❤️
Philz Coffee,"A very cozy place, good attention and very good coffee!"
Philz Coffee,Unique coffee taste that cannot be tasted in Korea The taste you want to drink two or three times Be sure to try it!
Philz Coffee,"Mint Mojito, which I ordered because I don't like coffee. A place I keep looking for because of the taste. The harmony of sweet coffee, creamy feeling, and refreshing scent of mint was fresh. It was also interesting to order from the barista, pay separately, and go back to the barista to get a drink."
Philz Coffee,"I've been recommended by a friend. If you go in and look around, the barista in front will help you order coffee by asking questions. In my case, just black coffee without cream or sugar, medium blend, small size, flavor hazelnut, go to the cashier on the right, the clerk asks the barista again if you have ordered, and tells the details and the payment is made. In the meantime, the barista will drop the coffee and you can get it right away. fresh coffee. I don't know coffee well, but I felt fresh."
Philz Coffee,"The unique taste of coffee is very addictive. If you are a coffee lover or a must-visit mukbang or a local landmark, I hope you take a picture of Philz Coffee. However, south of Union Square (especially towards City Hall), there are many homeless people or people with scary impressions. There aren't many cases where they do direct harm, but you should be careful when it's dark as it's not in the downtown area.  There's also a Philz Coffee just northeast of Union Square, so I recommend heading there. There are many shopping streets and corporate buildings there, so it's relatively safe and there's more to see."
Philz Coffee,"The cards are small, so it's hard to find that way, but a good spot in a corner. Large tables with lots of group tables and smaller individual tables. There are many approachable staff at the long counter. Express checkout. The average price is . ."
Philz Coffee,"The mint mojito is delicious. It's the first time I've tasted it, but if you ask for it to be a little less sweet, it will be even more delicious."
Philz Coffee,"Coffee tastes good It was dangerous even though I walked from Powell Station to here during the day. There are too many drug addicts and homeless people. As soon as I arrived at the cafe, I searched on the Internet and they said that this is a very safe neighborhood. Go to another Philz Coffee branch"
Philz Coffee,"Very soft and delicious flavors, a unique experience 👌😋☕"
Philz Coffee,"Delicious, fast and with several options for a quick breakfast, if you have a job in downtown San Francisco."
Philz Coffee,Drink mojito ice when you come here.. Add lots of mint
