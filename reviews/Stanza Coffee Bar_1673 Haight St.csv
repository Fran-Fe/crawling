Stanza Coffee Bar,"Great causal, breakfast burritos and sandwiches. Nothing too fancy - but everything made to order, so it’s fresh and well worth the price. There can be a wait sometimes.  I was debating getting a breakfast burrito from Whole Foods, but for the same price, you get a larger and fresher burrito here.  Would recommend if you want something nice and simple. Had the breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheese, bacon, avocado on a fluffy brioche)"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Great breakfast and lunch options, my go to is the baby breakfast burrito or mango salad."
Stanza Coffee Bar,Got a dirty chai latte. The consistency was like water and there was not enough chai flavor. It was overfilled and it spilled. There were no napkins left to clean up with. The tables are wobbly. Would not come back.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"I always enjoy this place. The coffee is delicious, prices reasonable, service quick and friendly. The wifi is strong, and the spot is relatively quiet allowing for quality work to get done. I dont use the outlets so cannot speak to their availability."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Great spot for breakfast burritos and coffee, friendly staff as well!"
Stanza Coffee Bar,Had the Gibraltar. It was very good but I wished there was more than 2 oz. of coffee. Cute coffee shop on Haight St. Parking is limited.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Dimly lit, loud music, small, and wifi password given to me did not work, but the pastry was really good and the cashier was very kind. Good for a grab-n-go, but not in my top choices of places to hang around at or an aesthetic environment"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"An excellent, laid back, neighborhood shop to get a delicious breakfast burrito and a cappuccino"
Stanza Coffee Bar,A cool artisan coffee shop in the middle of hippie district. Fits perfectly the area with the red walls and hipster vibe.
Stanza Coffee Bar,I was very happy with my americano. Smooth rich tatse and not too acidic or hot. Good vibe coffee shop with outlets and free wifi.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"If all you care about us Coffee, this place rocks.  The atmosphere is nice, just not my taste. The staff are nice and give good service.  But their coffee quality is out of this world. I recommend their pour overs, it's worth the extra.  I could have misjudged this place, as just another hipster coffee shop trying to look classy in the age of coffee showmanship, but they really deliver a solid cup."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Had the honey latte and it was great! Also had the maple, apricot, bacon scone recommend both items."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Wow, for their breakfast burrito! Adding some sausage, the mini option is the perfect size for people who doesn’t want to stuff themselves in the morning."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Ive worked on Haight for a long time and I often grab breakfast before work. For a long time all the breakfast burritos on the street were super disappointing, but Stanza's are really good! I like the Green Burrito the best, lots of fresh spinach, avocado, salsa and eggs. It's big enough to almost be two meals. The breakfast croissant with egg and cheese is my other go to, it's a lot of food for the price."
Stanza Coffee Bar,Nice coffees at a reasonable price. Nothing too crazy or outstanding about the place but allowed for me and two friends to have a pleasant experience.  My friend got a muffin which was definitely the highlight of our trip there. It was moist and had tons of fruit inside.
Stanza Coffee Bar,Just had a breakfast sando from here and it was truly awful. Really sad because we paid $8 at least per and tipped 20%.  Both sandwiches were burned. Both had one sad piece of bacon on it. No sauce at all. No tomato. No green onion. Really sloppy eggs and burned cheese. Really really really bad do not go here
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Very Haight street tourist run through for coffee or restroom...really nothing new and exciting about. I always enjoy black tea and I had a nice hot cup. I guess I drank my tea at the ""bar"" it's a quiet place to sit and read a book or get on a computer while drinking coffee or tea but not memorable."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Pretty good breakfast sandwiches. There is a bit of a wait, but the food is piping hot and fresh. While not amazing, it’s a decent staple. The employees there are chill too."
Stanza Coffee Bar,Incredible mini breakfast burritos and lattes
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Guys, you used to offer great coffee.  Please, if you charge $5 for a latter…then make a decent latte.  :( sad to see this place slide like that"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"I love all the bar seating at this place. Solid coffee and super friendly baristas. There's a lot of coffee shops in the neighborhood, but this is one of best. Not pretentious, just good coffee and nice people."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Nice, dimly lit place only good for working on laptops. The seats are also too high, you tend to think you are in a bar, overall I object to the bar-like feel it has. I have never been back there since I can barely find the place and there is good competition down the street."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Low lighting and mellow music greet me along with an attractive, friendly barista. Several people in line and she's alone. I consider ordering a regular cup of coffee to save time but really want my breve latte. (I need the half n half in it  for energy and regular coffee fries my nerves.) i was tired of waiting but I order it anyway and the girl next to me says with a smug attitude ""*I'll* just have a cup of coffee."" So she was served first. And then she needed food too. Which of course took long enough for it to slightly piss me off. The breve is good. Not spectacular. I like the dark feel of the place. I don't think the barista meant to disrespect but I would appreciate it if people that haven't been in line as long as me don't get served before me. And from the aftertaste of the latte I doubt the beans were ground just before they were brewed.  I could be wrong it could be the half-and-half they use."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Nice staff, friendly atmosphere but don't try to revive a super stale donut by microwaving it.  Cheap trick will never go there again."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Free wifi and good coffee in the Haight. The choco-chip cookie here is ridiculous <3 and my cappuccino was pretty good too. I came here to do some work and immediately found a seat by an outlet, so it seems like that shouldn't be too hard even though this isn't a huge cafe. The staff is friendly and pretty relaxed. Ambience is nice with plants hanging out of mason jars and cushioned leather seats. My only critique would be the volume of their music. Personally I would not have it so loud as there are a lot of people sitting on their laptops doing work…but I'm just nitpicking :p  I recommend!"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Cute little spot, their coffee is good and I love their breakfast food, especially the chorizo burrito :)"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Surprising find off Haight. Excellent café for great french press coffee and espresso, i hear the lattes are great also. Nice seating area for chatting with friends or working on a laptop. Nice vibe overall, servers are friendly, decent background music - for me this café is pretty near perfect."
Stanza Coffee Bar,12 oz is largest size they have and it's like 3$. This is the very most expensive place to get coffee within a mile radius of it and so not worth it. Sacred grounds has 20oz for 2.25 and tastes MUCH better. Drip coffee isn't good at stanza
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Good atmosphere, fast service, fast WiFi. But coffee (americano) didn’t taste great, had some instant coffee taste to it, even though it was barista made. Maybe if you choose one of the others it’s better."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"A great alternative to the oft-crowded Fourbarrel coffee around the corner, and more hipster. The thoughtful baristas are very friendly, and are happy to customize your drink to suit your taste and preferences. They serve terrific lattes, whether iced or hot. Your milk choices are whole, 2% and soy. Free wifi and there's usually plenty of available seating both inside and in the outdoor area."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Great coffee shop, fast wifi. Super friendly staff and good coffee"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Pretty deep coffee shop in the haight, offering pour over coffee, decent music on the speakers, spaciousness, free wi-fi, and the coffee cake I got was good. We stopped in here because we had been exploring the shops and just needed to take a break. Seems like they'll have wine offerings soon enoug, but for now, it was a relatively decent, no frill coffee shop that suited us. Plugs under the bar, too, if you need to chill and charge a phone. If you find yourself needing to charge your phone a lot, though, i recommend you get the Anker battery charging thingy. It's saved my life multiple times."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"A tourist magnet which is a good thing if your a company trying to stay afloat but terrible if you want to read a book and drink a cup of coffee in a public space.  I want mild chaos and distractions but not a constant nfl redzone experience (truth be told I've only seeing the redzone a handful of times and it was overly stimulating in the worst possible ways).  Coffee is fine, staff is nice but not a place to get work done."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Consistently disappointing. Slow service, low-quality ingredients but high priced coffee and a gross bathroom. Recently, they been out of signature items (Kyoto coffee) and standard stuff (iced or cold brew) which is mind boggling."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Wonderful neighborhood coffee spot.  Been coming here since 2015 and love the staff and other regulars.  The lates are my favorite as they come out so silky smooth, at the perfect temp :D"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Not wanting to be inconsiderate and hold up a table at Pork Store Cafe down the street, my friend and I migrated here after lunch so we could just sit and chat. Your typically quaint hipster cafe, with some limited seating both up front and in the back, and tables make out of upcycled wooden barrels.  I ended up ordering one of their pourovers, going with the Kilenso Mokonisa from Intelligentsia, which was surprisingly tastier than expected. Better than Philz? Nah, not really. But better than anything I've had from Blue Bottle, that's for sure - though, admittedly, I'm not a fan of the more sour, acidic coffees that many a person here seems to be, and that seems to be pretty much all Blue Bottle has these days.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - Another fairly small space, but I'd say about half their seating is accessible, albeit possibly a bit cramped.  Bathroom - Didn't check them out."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"After the getting rid of the expensive hot chocolate and replacing it with quality coffee, I was sold the first time I sat down one summer morning. Staff is friendly and also they play the best mix of music ( unlike the Mill, sorry guys but the Mill plays John Foxx jam band stuff ;). I'd try one of their snacks with the coffee. I like this place because I can focus and work on my laptop, even in the green "" hustle "" that haight street brings."
Stanza Coffee Bar,Great coffee but the staff seemed miserable and the atmosphere was very cold. I know it's a busy location with a lot of foot traffic and tourists so I can see why it might be stressful to work there.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Quaint coffee shop with wine barrel tables and plant-lined walls. The coffee is pretty good, but their muffins and scones are amazing! We'll come back just for those!"
Stanza Coffee Bar,Family shop you may get shanked if you go here
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Get my coffee here every morning. Absolutely love the quick service, but this morning I got there at 7:15, my usual time and they weren't quite open yet. Still giving them 5 stars. Hopefully this was a fluke."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Cool place for coffee and wifi. The baristas are nice and the place is hip. Bursts of tourists come through occasionally. Not much food, just breakfast bread and cookies."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Solid coffee shop with simple and well-priced coffee/teas, good seating, strong wifi, outlets, some more light-rock tunes for a bit of kick to your step.  Good spot for a coffee and solo chillin"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"I like to work on my laptop at coffee shops, and this one was perfect. Peaceful, not crowded,  wall outlet to plug in right at my table...and I got the job I was working on while I was there! Yeah success!!"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"best coffee on the top end of haight street, less of a wandering yippie burnout vibe than some of the other choices tho so what you lose in Kesey atmosphere you may gain in espresso."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Just another coffee shack jumping on the trend of charging high prices for medicore coffee.  Save your money and go and buy a can of Folgers.  They both taste the same ""bad""."
Stanza Coffee Bar,Great service. Kyoto cold brew was great. I didn't know cold brew could be sweet. Keep up the great work Stanza.
Stanza Coffee Bar,Serves excellent Counter Culture coffee. Plenty of table and counter space for laptops. Friendly staff behind the counter. Reliable free wifi.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"The drip coffee was pretty bad, but the latte was drinkable.  Beware the online menus are out of date and wine service has been discontinued."
Stanza Coffee Bar,I'm from NC originally and love that they stock Counter Culture coffee- great baristas to speak to and a very relaxed vibe (great for Sunday mornings).
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Simple place, great coffee and service."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Barista told me it was wasteful to ask for a cup of water for my 3 year old. They were intolerant and rude to my family. Iced coffee was watered down and bitter, like the service."
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Personally, I feel this place serves some of the best coffee in the entire city.  Try their pour-over coffee and stay for the pastries and free wi-fi :)"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Great coffee / espresso and awesome baristas.  The shop is small and cozy, and a nice escape from the tourist craziness on Haight Street."
Stanza Coffee Bar,The best coffee for my Australian tastes that I've found in San Francisco. Has a nice cosy vibe and friendly baristas.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Enjoyed a top notch pourover + more than my share of free wifi here this afternoon. Charming, helpful staff and the great soundtrack put a big smile on my face. thank you!"
Stanza Coffee Bar,"I tried the Kyoto iced coffee, which was excellent, very smooth. The staff was nice and it had a nice atmosphere, in Haight Ashbury"
Stanza Coffee Bar,I like it here mainly because it's a pretty nice place to work and study. They have plenty of outlets and decent Wi-Fi.
Stanza Coffee Bar,Omg the palm salad is amazing.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Great Coffee, i had  a macchiato the flavor and mixture of the milk and the espresso was as expected"
Stanza Coffee Bar,High quality coffee and drinks. It isn't the fastest place for grab and go. The baristas are pretty much hot.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Coffee tasted old, and when I told them I did not like it they Saud sorry. No refund offered. I will not come back."
Stanza Coffee Bar,The breakfast burrito was the best one I’ve ever had. Seriously. Would not change a thing.
Stanza Coffee Bar,Cozy & trendy coffeehouse on Haight Street.  Good place to enjoy a caffeine drink.
Stanza Coffee Bar,"Currently they've got a juicy, fruit- bomb Ethiopian natural as their espresso."
