Foghorn Coffee,I honestly travel from South Bay over the weekends just to get the latte here. Probably the best latte I have had in and around Bay Area. Just grab a cup and stroll around watching the view. Just the perfect lazy weekend. Not sure why the ratings are low for this place! P.S. Try their Hot Chocolate! It's so amazing.
Foghorn Coffee,"We started walking to Pier 39 early in the morning, and this was one of the only places open for coffee. I ordered a latte, and it was probably the one of the best I've had. I'm actually really surprised to see the ratings are not higher than what they are. And the location is perfect. You can stroll around the square then head over to Pier 39."
Foghorn Coffee,"Drinks were OK. Not very happy with the male barista who was inclined to rush me and wrap up our order as fast as possible. I didn’t feel good about the entire encounter and didn’t tip for the service (as someone who normally does) and got a sarcastic “thank you very much” after that. Don’t know if it’s something personal or what, but hope we can work to separate personal mood and work attitude next time. Thanks for your service."
Foghorn Coffee,Ordered lattes and Italian soda. My sister and mother enjoyed the latte. They said the milk was steamed to perfection. I asked for cream in my Italian soda 🥤 but she said they don't do that. I was disappointed.
Foghorn Coffee,"Friendliest barista I've encountered! Though their menu looks small, they have the ingredients to make most creations. Their caramel latte inspired me to write this review!"
Foghorn Coffee,What sizes do you have? 12oz “like I can’t believe you are asking what sizes we have” #AllSizesMatter
Foghorn Coffee,I had a hot chocolate and it was delightful. mostly I wanted to say thank you to the friendly barista  yesterday who gave this book lover wonderful suggestions. you shaped my day in the best way. thank you
Foghorn Coffee,Sweets are good but really big and difficult to finish.
Foghorn Coffee,"Hot chocolate was decent, nothing to die for exactly. A little overpriced, but it's what's expected in a touristy area like Ghirardelli Square."
Foghorn Coffee,"""Best caramel macchiato I've ever had!"" ... And I can say that the Mocha I had was perfect as well!! Great pick-me-up in Ghirardelli Square!"
Foghorn Coffee,"I got the chai tea latte thinking it would taste good being as it was made fresh. It was no good at all, and very overpriced for what it was. Starbucks certainly beats this place."
Foghorn Coffee,"One of the best coffee shops in town. I’m a coffee lover, so I can say when I try a nice coffee. This time asked for an Ice coffee and white mocca… really good. Totally worth it!"
Foghorn Coffee,"They won't even sell cups of tap water, only bottled. We had iced tea - they only offer black, and it's way over-steeped and bitter."
Foghorn Coffee,"Friendly service, and great coffee!"
Foghorn Coffee,Decent cup of coffee. Slow service.
Foghorn Coffee,Don't go if there are more than three people in line... The mocha is no doubt excellent but there's only one machine and one server so it's a long wait for each customer.
Foghorn Coffee,Thank you for enjoying our mocha. We are sorry sometimes the line does get long and we want to keep consistent quality
Foghorn Coffee,I was desperately wanting a cup of coffee so went here as it was close by. The coffee was so bad I threw it out after a couple sips!
Foghorn Coffee,Had a nice iced latte here. Typical prices for a tourist area but hit the spot. Friendly service.
Foghorn Coffee,"Great coffee and service! Also very convenient location, I will be back!"
Foghorn Coffee,Thank you so Much
Foghorn Coffee,"Friendly staff, best tasting coffee in the area!"
Foghorn Coffee,Went there during open hours and it’s closed
Foghorn Coffee,Don't waste your money. VERY overpriced
Foghorn Coffee,Charlie approved hot cocoa.
Foghorn Coffee,Picture Perfect Coffee
