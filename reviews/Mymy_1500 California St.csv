Müesi Cafe,"This place is fantastic! If you're looking for a nice place to hang out and chit chat with a friend or group of friends, or better, if you're looking for a place with a nice atmosphere where you can work from, Müesi is the PERFECT spot! They always have nice music playing on the background, the staff is super friendly (special thanks to Sara and Adrian, they're always very awesome) and everything in their menu is out of this world. Super recomend the Nutty Protein - that's my favorite by far!"
Müesi Cafe,This place is great for working. On a weekday you are more than likely to find yourself smushed between two zoom calls. The bowls are heavy on the yogurt and nut butter and  light on the grain and berries. I could pay a lot less to buy Greek yogurt at the store and throw a handful of oats on it.
Müesi Cafe,Great cafe. Coffees are really good and their butter croissants are out of this world. Please also try avocado toast really feeling.
Müesi Cafe,"Love this place for a healthy and hearty breakfast. Pastries, lattes, muesli bowls and sandwiches/tartines"
Müesi Cafe,"Really cool breakfast spot in Marina! Friendly staff, clean space and clean customer restroom. Recommend the breakfast sandwich 🥪 Good coffee too! ☕️ Would definitely come back! 😊"
Müesi Cafe,"Staff is very nice and for dining in they prepared the beverages on cups (avoiding plastic which I appreciate). The turmeric latte is a must, without adding any sugar and you’ll enjoy a tasty sweet beverage. It’s mostly crowded around 1PM and doesn’t has many plugs, so be prepared with fully charged devices."
Müesi Cafe,"Nice cafe, beautiful interior. I just a coffee, so cannot comment of food. The girl at the counter was not very friendly and was apprehensive to accept cash and kinda weird about it, but the other girl (dark hair) was very happy and friendly. Nice spot to sit and work."
Müesi Cafe,Delicious vegan options. The coconut yogurt is super creamy. This is a great place for a cup of coffee and a chill vibe to get some work done.
Müesi Cafe,"A modern, light-soaked coffeeshop with long-opening hours and signature muesli offerings.  I have been ordering variations on their muesli and always been delighted by the taste and the melange. They use less sweeteners than you might be used to around here - how great and definitely better for your health. This holds for the muesli and for drinks (like the hot chocolate). And yes - the *muesli* thing is real, what you get in your bowl is a *muesli* not *granola*.  This is a good place to work - comfortable seating, solid wifi, and long hours, even during the weekends.  On the light-heartedly quibbling side, I would argue with the designation of ""European-inspired"", where I doubt the a traditional cafe based in Vienna, Paris, or Zurich would ever recognize themselves in this outlet."
Müesi Cafe,"What a great new coffee shop in the neighborhood! Such a sleek & modern yet cozy design. Very clean, lots of snack & drink options (cool lattes!). The baristas are so kind - they explained their custom drinks very well and checked on us making sure we were enjoying the experience. 10/10 customer service. Looks like a great place to study as well - lots of tables inside with outlets and they have about 6 smaller tables outside for their outdoor seating. Highly recommend!"
Müesi Cafe,"Amazed at how bad this was. Everything looked so good. We got a coffee, matcha, and chai. The chai was genuinely the worst chai I have ever had and I couldn’t stomach it. The food was very underwhelming. We all got toast and agreed that the toast was dry and unappetizing, which really ruined the rest of the meal. Also would not recommend getting the lox-they were extremely thick-cut and very very salty. We would have rather gone to Starbucks, which is depressing."
Müesi Cafe,"This quiet cafe should be renamed as San Fran Public Library ; it’s superb interior design is a great showroom for a furniture store ; it’s modern but not minimalist and has more warmth than the patrons ;  love the creamy leather chairs, the grey sofas with wooden headboard, the small round wooden  end tables to hold your coffee cup and food. The patrons are really props facing laptops; the  drip coffee is smooth as it should be in a monastery. Perfect studio for mindfulness after you are done exercising in Equinox next door."
Müesi Cafe,"Had the Kimchi-Avocado sandwich. This was GREAT! Best of it: The  bread. Just like in Europe, super tasty, dense, crusty…awesome! We will be back for more. Highly recommended."
Müesi Cafe,"Reminds me a little bit of home (🇦🇺Australia). Whenever I say muesli here, no one knows what I mean, so it's exciting that this cafe exists! The berry yogurt bowl with cinnamon muesli, was delish. The berries were very fresh, and it was the perfect level of sweetness (there wasn't any artificial sweetener). The staff were very attentive and friendly. The interior is designed very thoughtfully, and spaciously. I will definitely be back!  Next time I'll be trying the coffee too, which is from AndyTown, one of our favorite roasters."
Müesi Cafe,"This is literally the first review I've ever submitted, which should say a lot. I go to Cafe Muesi because it's clean, has great wifi, tons of natural light, amazing coffee (quad shot cortado), friendly staff, great food options if you're hungry, and incredibly well DJ'd (I've Shazam'd at least 3 great songs from there). It's an awesome place to go whether you're reading a book, catching up with a friend, doing some work, or grabbing some coffee to go."
Müesi Cafe,"Uplifting interior, great to work. Tried the paleo pecan bowl which was perfect - not sweet."
Müesi Cafe,Very clean café that would be great for a coffee date or doing some work/reading. I was sceptical about the oatmilk/almond blend but it was really good!
Müesi Cafe,"We went to this place this morning. Very pathetic customer service by the lady staff. She was yelling at another staff to deny a simple request we made to make the coffee in a mug (as they used to do). She said the shop will be closing soon so she can't do it. We totally understand if that was the case... however, her tone was not good. Completely rude! PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE BY HER!"
Müesi Cafe,"We love coming to Muesi Cafe. Great coffee, wonderful staff and a welcoming place for the neighborhood. Also has places to work and solid wifi. Skye puppy gives it 5 paws."
Müesi Cafe,"Great spot in SF for a quick breakfast, coffee and/or matcha!"
Müesi Cafe,"Never had Iranian but we happened upon this cafe and so glad we did! The lavender latte was so good as well as the creme filled (donut-like) pastry and we got it cold--great decision, bc it went so well with the coffee. Thank you to the guy behind the counter for helping me choose!"
Müesi Cafe,The lady staff was super rude when we asked the batista guy whether its possible to get our coffee in mugs as shown in the review pics.. just to enjoy the art and have an expereice. She  yelled at the guy and told that it will only be given in a togo cups. Seriously? She could have simply said no. She has worst attitude and customer service. However the guy was sweet as he still tried to make us happy by doing an art in a togo cup. I would give  Zero star for her if I could!
Müesi Cafe,"I come to this cafe everyday and absolutely love it. The staff is incredible, especially Sarah...she is the manager and inspires very happy staff and cafe-goers. Specifically, she will remember names and orders of repeat customers and even remake an order if needed to ensure an incredible customer experience."
Müesi Cafe,"After a morning of walking around the area, I was absolutely famished. I just happened to see this place across the street and thought I’d check it out. The bowl I ordered (triple berry) was so good! It did not lack in flavor. The berries were plump and fresh. They make a blended nut milk in-house that was excellent for a latte. And to top it all off, the person working at the counter was so friendly and pleasant."
Müesi Cafe,"Muesli is a great place to eat! They have health conscious foods and comfort foods available and they have a laid-back and comfortable environment that lets you feel warm and welcome. The food is delicious! I was hesitant to go here, I thought it sounded like nothing but a bowl of cereal, but, it has everything I could possibly imagine eating for breakfast! I left full and happy! And I admit I mostly ate comfort food, but the healthy stuff looked irresistible as well!"
Müesi Cafe,"Nice clean place. good to hang out and get some work done or chat  Get the lox toast. So tasty with fresh dill and lemon. Skip the sugar laden ""healthy"" vegan stuff...."
Müesi Cafe,Didn't like their service. The café space was dirty full of müesi crumbs.
Müesi Cafe,Delicious yogurt bowls & wonderful coffee! Stop by for breakfast! Highly recommend!
Müesi Cafe,Really great place to get a coffee and GLUTEN FREE toast. So happy to find this beautiful place
Müesi Cafe,"First time in today and was VERY pleased with the entire experience.  My husband had a cappuccino and ordered a latte with the house special oat milk.  Both were exceptional!  The highlight was the greek yogurt and berry muesli bowl we shared.  I thought it looked healthy but didn't really expect anything that remarkable.  The flavors, especially of the yogurt, were absolutely scrumptious.  The people working there were very nice and the interior was bright and clean.  I look forward to becoming a regular."
Müesi Cafe,Great place for coffee and food. Plenty of seating in a nice ambience.
Müesi Cafe,"Divine bowls,lovely staff and cute space."
Müesi Cafe,This is an awesome cafe - their oat almond milk latte is super delicious. Staff is super friendly too - it’s one of my favorite coffee shops in SF.
Müesi Cafe,"Good bowls (not too sweet). Coffee was fine. Toasts are average. The avocado toast didn’t have much avocado on it, and the bread wasn’t very crispy. Giving it 4-stars because it’s a great place to hangout with friends."
Müesi Cafe,"Nice spot in a pretty part of town to get some work done. Coffee is great. Turmeric and Charcoal lattes are also nice if you don't want any caffeine (at least I think they're caffeine free, don't hold me to it)"
Müesi Cafe,"Good working vibe, but 3 stars due to ""meh"" service and dirty drinking water."
Müesi Cafe,"Great place for internet access, or to sit and relax. Lots of people work there."
Müesi Cafe,Omg... avo radish was delicious!!! Yummmmmmmmm
Müesi Cafe,"I ordered the pesto chicken toast, and it was awful.  It was so heavily sprinkled with red pepper flakes, I couldn't taste the pesto or the chicken.  Eleven dollars for something inedible.  What a waste."
Müesi Cafe,"Great healthy options, many items served on toast."
Müesi Cafe,"Very helpful. They were accommodating to my food allergies and really nice. They have good protein options for breakfast including salmon, bacon, and chicken."
Müesi Cafe,Their card machine wasn’t working so they covered me! Such sweet staff
Müesi Cafe,"I just moved up the street and looked up some coffee shops near by. My girlfriend and I chose Müesi and let me tell you, great find!! They had delicious non dairy options for her and very savory all around! The coffee is top notch as well! I’ll be a regular. Thank you Brittany!"

Müesi Cafe,Good coffee
Müesi Cafe,"Good quality at not cheap price. Unfortunately plastic cutlery, which does not fit the store. If there was less plastic waste, there would be 5 points. Staff very friendly and helpful. No plastic in the future please!"
Müesi Cafe,"If you are hungry in the morning and like a delicious, but also healthy breakfast, this is the place for you. There is freshly prepared muesli, where the fruit is freshly cut into it. There are also sandwiches with eggs, or avocados, etc. Everything is freshly prepared and tastes really delicious. Of course, there is also fresh coffee, and it is really tasty. There is also free Wi-Fi here, so you can also do a little something for work or just surf the Internet. The staff is very friendly, so you start your day here with a smile."
Müesi Cafe,I can't understand how people want to pay attention to particularly healthy food and then get their food in plastic cups for the café. Why can't you serve a granola muesli in a bowl? Why isn't your banana bread served in a paper bag on a plate? No amount of good food can hide this lack.
Müesi Cafe,Thanks to vanilla latte
