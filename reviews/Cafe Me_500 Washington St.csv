Cafe Me,Perfect spot downtown for some grab and go breakfast in the morning. Very friendly small business with great coffee and quick turn around times. In and out every morning in less than 5 minutes. Covered pick up area in case of weather.
Cafe Me,"Best little place for a breakfast sandwich in the FiDi. Service is super friendly (unnervingly so considering where it is in sf), and food is simple and delicious. Highly recommend the giant corned beef sandwich, then skip lunch."
Cafe Me,"The croissant sandwich was very good, but beware of the price hike. It's nearly twice as much as some of the pictures suggest! Not such a good price-to-experience ratio anymore. Adding a recent photo of the menu, as of August 2021"
Cafe Me,Great place to get a fantastic breakfast sandwich in the Financial District.  So tasty!  And the hot chocolate and chai tea were amazing.  Wish I would have found this place at the start of my trip.  I would have grabbed breakfast here every day.  And the people working there were extremely friendly.
Cafe Me,Last morning on biz travel and needed some Java and found this small little cafe.   The owner was super nice and explained how he researched the local SF roasters and chose the one he did before he opened.   BETTER than Peete’s and Starbucks.  $2.75 for a large.   Gourmet coffee with exceptional taste and flavor.  👍🏻
Cafe Me,Coffee Is Garbage Not Sugar When You Ask For Sugar He Give You 2 Small Packs Only Egg Sandwich Is Good
Cafe Me,Cute little hidden breakfast sandwich place! Highly recommend!!!!
Cafe Me,Friendly and quick. Nice little spot and the coffee is good.
Cafe Me,"Great breakfast sandwiches, nice service, quick and easy!"
Cafe Me,Great little place. The prices are fair and the food is delicious.
Cafe Me,Great place for a quick breakfast sandwich! I had the bacon egg and cheese croissant with iced coffee and it really hit the spot. I work in the same building so it’s really great for a quick breakfast if I’m running late. The staff are super friendly too.
Cafe Me,"Fast, no frills, and great breakfast sandwiches for on the go!"
Cafe Me,"Great Place, small little gem around FIDI Staff is super friendly. Must try."
Cafe Me,"Bagels are on par with a cheap supermarket brand. Service is rude. The cashier insisted on entering the tip himself, after turning the screen away from me."
Cafe Me,Super amazing gem tucked away in the Financial District with the most delicious and fresh breakfast options. You really can't go wrong with any of the menu options....and they do have something for everyone! Also the coffee is a nice dark roast. These are hard working friendly people running a fantastic cafe with just the right energy to start the day.
Cafe Me,"Not 5 star worthy, but good nonetheless. The food is fresh and the service is great! I should have been more adventurous but I played it safe by getting a turkey and egg breakfast sandwich on wheat. It wasn't greasy, and the egg was cooked to perfection!"
Cafe Me,Fantastic food and coffee. Great place to grab early morning breakfast. The staff was very friendly.
Cafe Me,The hype is real!  I've been staying at a hotel nearby and try to find a new breakfast spot each morning.  This is THE spot!  It's a small little shop run by very friendly and efficient people.  The breakfast sandwiches come out quick so you're in and out. There's no indoor seating but plenty of tables outside in the courtyard.   Simple.  Fast.  Delicious.
Cafe Me,"We picked up a sausage, egg, and cheese muffin and a bacon, egg, and cheese croissant to have for breakfast at our hotel. Both were very yummy! The lady who takes orders is the sweetest! There was a short line, but these guys are very efficient. Great quick breakfast find!"
Cafe Me,"Line was out the door and for good reason. With an amazing selection of great breakfast sandwiches and fresh coffee at a great price point, it's clear this is a great local spot which keeps people coming back. They run a tight ship behind the counter with orders constantly being yelled back to the cooks and then out the window to you when your order is done. The lady behind the counter is probably the nicest person on earth. If you don't crack a smile when you talk to her, I would be surprised. Minimal seating in the courtyard but that's okay since it seems like most people are taking their orders to go. The bagel and lox sandwich was great!"
Cafe Me,Walked here from Union Square area for breakfast to find them closed. Important info to post online.
Cafe Me,"Small little spot hidden by office buildings. great place to get some breakfast sandwiches early in the morning. The lady who takes your order is super friendly and they work quite fast.  They open early and tend to shut down by 2 pm. So, if you want to get a sandwich for lunch be sure to get there by like 1:45ish so they still have the kitchen going."
Cafe Me,"Was staying at Hilton Financial District. Wanted easy but good breakfast and this place delivered. Breakfast sandwiches made from scratch, full coffee bar, and great, friendly service. Definitely recommend!"
Cafe Me,"What an amazing surprise!  This little out of the way walk up cafe is hosted by the most friendly and sincere couple, and the food is quick, affordable and great.  Forget about Starbucks! Go here for coffee and breakfast!"
Cafe Me,"Ran inside of what seems to be a closet.  A friendly couple with delicious sandwiches and coffee for what only could be described in San Fran as ""dirt cheap"".  Ate breakfast here on the way to an Alcatraz tour.  It was a cute little place and I would go again."
Cafe Me,"Yum! Great little breakfast place! Quick, friendly, and great price. Perfect for me and my two young kids. Be warned there is only a little outdoor seating, though, if you are looking for a sit down place."
Cafe Me,It is a small place but the food and service is huge!  Wow! What a find!!  The owner is so friendly and really cares about the product you are getting.  The bagel with smoked salmon was lovely. So good for a really inexpensive price.   We dont live in san fran but when we come back we will definitely visit cafe me!!
Cafe Me,the croissant breakfast sandwich was so good!!!
Cafe Me,This amazing little spot was my go to breakfast place when I went to a conference recently. The folks were super nice; the food was really tasty; and for SF the food was super cheap. Good drip coffee too!
Cafe Me,This place got good reviews so me and hubby decided to try. Small quaint cafe with outside area to sit. We tried there crossaint and english muffin breakfast sandwiches which were delicious! They were made fresh to order and very reasonably priced! Perfect for a quick yummy bite on the go! We will definitely be back!
Cafe Me,Very small place with only two tables outside but it’s great if you are in a hurry! The food was amazing! We had the number one with ham and a number four with egg and will definitely look this place up next time we are in town!
Cafe Me,"Great little place for breakfast. Tasty Breakfast bagel for about 5$, it's hard to find a better deal in the area. I was also impressed with the coffee, very good."
Cafe Me,"MMMmmmm. Needed a small, hearty breakfast within walking distance of our hotel; enter Cafe Me. Small kitchen serving delicious breakfast sandwiches is an accurate description of Cafe Me. Place is sandwiched in the middle of the building, a bit closer to Sansome St. If all you need is a quick bite, made fresh, and a cup of coffee, I recommend Cafe Me."
Cafe Me,Everything you want and need from an informal  breakfast pick up spot. Most sandwiches under 5$. Great combos under 5$. Fast and polite service. This could easily be a part of your morning routine.
Cafe Me,"Good little place, cheap, quick and food was good!"
Cafe Me,"I bought a lox bagel and they charge me for the tomatoes and cucumbers. That is standard on a lox bagel, not extra. Everyone knows that, I you want to make more money just up your prices. There is no need for hidden charges. And the lox bagel sucks."
Cafe Me,"Super friendly couple serve great breakfast bagels, crosisant and sandwich. A lot of business to go. Three small tables. Delicious!"
Cafe Me,What a great hole-in-the-wall! Very happy woman with a sing-song voice greets you and takes your order. The food and coffee are great.
Cafe Me,A quick tasty panini with fresh tomato & mozzarella salad convenient to Union Square & Market Street shopping. Nice break on their sidewalk patio.
Cafe Me,The breakfast bagel with bacon or the one with canadian bacon are good and cheap (food and coffee for $4!!!). The nicest staff around. Definitely will return.
Cafe Me,Cashier was extremely friendly. I got a lox bagel (with capers and onions) and an iced coffee all for $6. I love this place.
Cafe Me,Had breakfast bagels and coffee. Everything was good. They also have pretty decent chai.
Cafe Me,Do not try hot chocolate. It's watery and tasteless. We threw out 2 cups after just couple of sips.
Cafe Me,"Great place for a quick breakfast! Prices are very reasonable, breakfast sandwiches are delicious and the staff is very friendly and cheerful."
Cafe Me,Good for quick/easy breakfast and coffee. Cheap for SF. Owner is nice but don’t get him started on politics

Cafe Me,Breakfast sandwiches on the go.  Very fast and friendly with only 2 on staff. I would definitely go there again.
Cafe Me,"Being a sucker for breakfast sandwiches, it is hard for me not to give 5 stars especially when they are fast, really nice and prices start around $4."
