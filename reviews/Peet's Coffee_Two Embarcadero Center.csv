Peet's Coffee,Best place to stop by if you’re craving for a drink to keep you warm when it’s cold outside. Had the caramel macchiato and it was exactly what I needed. Service was incredibly efficient despite having decreased staff.
Peet's Coffee,Their Lavender Cold Brew Oat Latte with Brown Sugar Jelly tastes so GOOD!
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee shop and a lovely Starbucks alternative. Got the egg and bacon brioche which was super tasty.  Nice indoor and outdoor seating area on Market Street with friendly staff.  Keep up the good work.
Peet's Coffee,Nice Peet's.  Right next to Powell Street Bart by Ross Store and across the street from Old Navy.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating.  There is also a limited upstairs seating too.  I saw there r a couple of outlets to charge your cell phone in the seating area downstairs.  Nice big ceiling to floor windows to stay cozy while watching everyone go by..
Peet's Coffee,a nice and convenient location to grab a coffee and snack throughout the day. i tried the dark chocolate mocha and a slice of the cinnamon swirl coffee cake and both were very nice.
Peet's Coffee,This Peet’s cafe is the only one near Union Square! As a huge Peet’s fan I’m so happy it’s here. Very friendly! Great beverages!
Peet's Coffee,A great place to pick up a morning coffee and pastries.  Quick service and friendly.  Prices are standard and not overpriced.
Peet's Coffee,Great! Strong coffee! Good flavor. Staff was helpfull and nice. Remade my orde to make me happy without additional charges. Will definately go back.
Peet's Coffee,"THANK YOU for quickly letting me use your fabulous clean bathroom, even though I was not a customer, and I never spent $0.01 here. People don't forget about stuff like this. That was like a month ago. I really had to go. Haha"
Peet's Coffee,"Got jumped and pepper sprayed outside the store the night of 3/2 by a bunch of teenagers - go inside Peets for help, and the employees treat me like I'm some kind of animal.  There was only one young man working in there who had any kind of compassion whatsoever. Hats off to him. The other employees should be ashamed of themselves."
Peet's Coffee,"This is my weekend PEETS. They are nice youngsters working here 🌹!  Please do not forget to tip you barista, their wages are not enough to live on in San Francisco! 😇"
Peet's Coffee,"very dirty place full of beggars and everyone very rude, I think it's because of the number of people who go to this place, because it's on the market, so it's crowded there, so this means that the employees clearly don't have much patience, so , a simple mix-up, made the two girls treat me like shi t it seems that I committed something very serious, they are rude and without patience, including this Asian woman who was working there today, if you don't like your job, look for another place to work, that then you don't have to make that shi t face that you did today, that's my little suggestion for you. (NEGATIVE STARS)"
Peet's Coffee,They have some good seating options upstairs and outside.
Peet's Coffee,"Got a cortado, and it was good. Everything was clean and was not too loud or too quiet. As far as perts coffee locations in SF, this is good."
Peet's Coffee,Coffe was good but the Place was insanely dirty
Peet's Coffee,@liam @773market ...  He made the best drink.. took his time and made it peerrffeecctt!!! Definitely will be having him make my drinks when I go there and he's there ..  😎👌.. from beginning to end was perfect 💯💯💯 THANK YOU LIAM .. keep up the great work
Peet's Coffee,"They always treat me super nicely, spell my name correctly and the coffee doesn't taste burnt like another nearby chain. If I'm buying coffee this is the place I like to go."
Peet's Coffee,"Excellent! Baristas were super friendly and helpful. I saw this dessert and asked for a recommendation to drink with it, almond latte. Price point was great (under $7 for both). They didn’t ask for a tip and the WiFi is very easy to access. The atmosphere at this location is many solo people getting work done."
Peet's Coffee,I live their chocolate croissants which are way better than in Starbucks. Inside the lines may be daunting. Toilets on passcode. Wifi available with strong signal. Location is perfect for bart station and major shopping venues. Will miss those croissants. Ask to heat them.
Peet's Coffee,The cold brew is very nice the staff very helpful.
Peet's Coffee,Nice Peet’s. Nice view of the street. Two-story with free WiFi and clean bathrooms. The staff is friendly and helpful. They are busy all the time. One of the busiest Peet’s I’ve been to. I was able to sit here and wait an hour or two for my friend to get off work undisturbed.
Peet's Coffee,"Coffee is great. clean place, nice decor for a café. Service not as friendly as expected."
Peet's Coffee,"If you are a star bucks regular stick with their coffee but if you are not a regular coffee person then try Peet’s , they have great options too with a little bit of their own twist and coffee from different region"
Peet's Coffee,"Don't come here to work. None of the electrical outlets work and they're not interested in fixing them. They have labels on half of them that say ""outlets don't work""."
Peet's Coffee,"I'm not much of a cafe person, so take it with a grain of salt (or don't). But the cafe isn't an ideal workspace. It's noisy and the music is loud too. The glasses are dirty and the floor aren't great where the power outlets are; and you have to use your fingers to open (unless I am doing it wrong). However, the staff seemed nice and the Chai I had was great too. So, pros and cons I guess."
Peet's Coffee,"Navneet, thank you for taking the time to visit our San Francisco Peet's. We are so sorry to see your experience was only 2 star worthy. Let us know how we can improve next time at customerservice@peets.com."
Peet's Coffee,The food and staff were great. It was dirty and the people in that area are interesting
Peet's Coffee,Alexis and Jasmine gave great hospitality to me and my guest great place as usual
Peet's Coffee,"Good place to chill, rest your legs and have some coffee. Clean place, nice jazz music. Friendly staff. Had the latte. Better than starbucks but Blue Bottle is better if you want some comparison."
Peet's Coffee,"I totally would recommend to stay away of this place! It’s San Francisco, baby 🤣🤮 crazy disgusting crowd inside and outside of this coffee shop. They also use their restroom all the time. Try to find better neighbours especially if you are a tourist and don’t want to ruin your trip impression"
Peet's Coffee,"POWER OUTLETS DON'T WORK!  Bring a fully charged laptop!  They have outlets on the wall equipped with USB plugs but they ""don't work""  Message received, you don't want us lingering. Guess I'll get my coffee and do some work at Starbucks, and buy another coffee and maybe a scone. Look at that, you just lost $25."
Peet's Coffee,"If you are familiar with Starbucks this place is quite the same. Overall same prices, menu is nearly identical- but in my opinion the coffee tasted better. Seating area could be improved (seems like they focus on take-away)"
Peet's Coffee,"Aggressively similar to Starbucks and priced about the same too. I ordered a vanilla latte, breakfast sandwich and a lemon scone. And I don't think I could have told you the difference between them and Starbucks in a blind taste test. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing, I did enjoy all of it. But it's not something I would go out of my way to get."
Peet's Coffee,"Fast service when not crowded. Good taste from drinks and food. Typically, fast service at counter for ordering."
Peet's Coffee,"Popped in here as the more famous branded coffee place over the road was closed. It was a mistake, baristas are painfully slow and rude. The whole ordering and delivery system is flawed. You get a tea immediately but your coffee takes 15 minutes to arrive. Gave up in the end. Give it a miss, there must be better options in the local area."
Peet's Coffee,"The coffee from this outlet is so diluted and does not smell like coffee at all! It's just like drinking a cup of sugar water! And to add to my misery, the coffee was luke warm!  Do walk over to the nearby Starbucks where you can get a good cup of steaming coffee!"
Peet's Coffee,Ordered grande Cappuccino with extra wipped cream (for free) - done   quick and staff very friendly
Peet's Coffee,Zero merchandise on the shelves. The place was trashed. The staff was very rude.
Peet's Coffee,Honestly not good at all: never went to a peet’s coffee and it was not edible
Peet's Coffee,Worst Peet’s shop in town… staff is rude and sanitation is missing.
Peet's Coffee,Coffee is good but unfortunately they don’t use a recup system or normal cups. So it’s a lot of rubbish 🥺👀 please 🙏 think of becoming more sustainable. Our Earth needs that🌍 …
Peet's Coffee,The like the environment and the outside seats. Good place to study specially inside or in their second floor.
Peet's Coffee,Very good but expensive compared to another cities.
Peet's Coffee,"Typically a Starbucks fanatic. I stopped by Peet's because it was near my work for a Monday. I love extra sweet and creamy drinks.  Not sure what on their menu might satisfy my craving for coffee heaven, the cashier recommended the ""Black Tie.""  The Barista added extra Condensed Milk and topped it off with rich Cold Brew. Bam!! I'll be back!"
Peet's Coffee,AMAZING service. When I ordered my Peet's app balance was exactly one cent short (what are the odds?) and I was told not to worry about it. Also I accidentally dropped my sandwich right after picking it up and they gave me a new one for free. Staff are very nice here.
Peet's Coffee,"Noah, we love seeing this! We appreciate that you took time to visit our San Francisco coffeebar. Check out our signature Havana Cappuccino next time!"
Peet's Coffee,"Finally a few coffee shops open!!  Pete's coffee is a welcome reminder of the days of old. Able to sit and have a nice cup of black gold. Been here several times since opening and it's great. Great staff, great service. Coffee seems a bit pricey, but hey everyone is trying to make a come back at this point. Plenty of plugins and places to sit inside or out."
Peet's Coffee,"Brent, we love hearing you enjoyed our black gold coffee and that our team took good care of you. We can't wait to serve you again soon."
Peet's Coffee,"I went in the early morning slightly before the rush hour. The place was occupied by customers, but not too many at that hour. The baristas were very cheerful, maybe a little future for that time of the morning me not being a morning person. I'm beginning to think Pete's is more favored by me than Starbucks."
Peet's Coffee,Great service! The barista and cashier helped me pick a beverage and were patient as I was deciding due to my dietary restrictions! Pastries are fresh and delicious and much more affordable than other places!
Peet's Coffee,"Lovely, pleasant staff. Really a cut above the rest in terms of customer service. Cute little location with a selection of baked goods as well. The coffees here were a tad too sweet for my liking and none of them were on the menu as having sweetener, so that was a star off. If you have sugar intake concerns be sure to check before you order. Also, a homeless guy harassed me to buy him a coffee on my way in and out but I guess this is San Fran what can I expect."
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee and warm atmosphere with ample study / work space. Was pretty crowded. Reliable but slow WiFi.
Peet's Coffee,"The staff are friendly and very helpful. Gotta try the chicken and waffle sandwich, YUM-O!"
Peet's Coffee,"Decent coffee, service is lacking. Missed off a pastry item then when i went back they ran out."
Peet's Coffee,"Poor quality berry scones. Very dry, barely any berry flavor and had a weird clove taste. The iced cinnamon bun was soft and nice though."
Peet's Coffee,"super strong flatwhite, very friendly staff"
Peet's Coffee,"Decided to make it our go to coffee place while in San Francisco. Really friendly staff with a good, consistent espresso. Will definitely be back when we're back town!"
Peet's Coffee,The place is dirty and they always mess my order.
Peet's Coffee,Friendly staff and MUCH BETTER QUALITY than Starbucks. The atmosphere is quiet and they have outlets so you can study or do work on your computer. They don't play loud music like other coffee bars.
Peet's Coffee,Unbelievable price gouging  This is the only coffee shop that charged close to $1 for a small amount of soy milk.  They did not have the courtesy of being upfront and honest.  This is the worst Peets location.
Peet's Coffee,"Glenn, thank you for taking the time to share your perspective about our pricing. We will share this feedback with our team."
Peet's Coffee,Nice and clean place for a quick breakfast and coffee before your workday.  There’s a nice loft on second floor that’s well lit and clean. See my sideways picture for a view. Relatively quiet up there where you can gather your thoughts before tackling your work. Will stop by again.
Peet's Coffee,"Extremely dirty. The peppermint mocha had almost no flavor. Nevertheless, the cookies tasted great as well as the banana bread. The Caramel Javiva tasted OK but I prefer the Starbucks Caramel Frappuccino. In addition, the service was excellent. The employee who took our order had a lot of energy and amazing attitude."
Peet's Coffee,cheap and delicious breakfast. Tried gold latte and it's not bad.
Peet's Coffee,"This place is great. Swift service and delicious coffee. I love the Golden Chai with coconut milk. One of the workers helped give me directions as well, since it was my first time in San Francisco. The staff was all around super friendly."
Peet's Coffee,"Great staff, but keep seeing prices go up and up for coffee. $3.10 for a large and now they’ve decided to tack on the Healthy SF tax. Might as well by a pound of French Roast and make it at home.  Used to have security to deal with panhandling, but now they leave it up to staff to deal with."
Peet's Coffee,"One of the best coffee places I visit. Open very early, and the cranberry and walnut scones are a treat. On two occasions I have watched a young woman, who I assume was a manager, interacting with the baristas in a positive, respectful manner. A little place on Market, down from Powell street station.. felt a little like home."
Peet's Coffee,A nice Café for take a break. 🇺🇸🇹🇭🇩🇪🇨🇭🏳️‍🌈💚 …
Peet's Coffee,Best place in the city to get an awesome cup of coffee. People are friendly and the service is prompt. Do yourself a favor: caramel Javiva swirl! You will love this place and the atmosphere. So much better than Starbucks!!!
Peet's Coffee,"Coffee was decent, service was ok"
Peet's Coffee,"Very crowded, and they forgot my pastry."
Peet's Coffee,"I think the Customer service here is wonderful. Lines move fast compared to Starbucks across the street. I absolutely love the Nitro. That's my drink normally, large nitro. I think Eli is by far one of the best to represent that coffee house. He always remembers his regulars. He is just a very polite and friendly guy. Everyone there actually seems to be great so far. Been there maybe 25 times since it opened. Will definitely continue going, personally I think their coffee is better than Starbucks anyhow."
Peet's Coffee,"Below average. They forgot to make my wrap, then were totally unapologetic. If you run a busy coffee shop, you need a system that keeps track of the orders, and at least apologize if you get it wrong."
Peet's Coffee,"Service is pretty good, they can be slow at times. The coffee is solidly good, better than Starbucks I would say. They also have one of my favorite breakfast items, chicken chorizo flat bread."
Peet's Coffee,"The place is nice and so are the the staff. The only thing that bugged me though were the homeless people. I mean I am paying money not only to enjoy the coffee but as well a quiet time with myself and my computer and all of the sudden a random person smelling awfully bad asking me to purchase from him a Bart ticket. 😡 I really hope this issue can be addressed because this is not the first time that this happened, otherwise I would have given this place a five star."
Peet's Coffee,"I'm from Chicago,  where Peet's cafe's are sparsely located.  They're on EVERY corner in downtown San Francisco and it's great.   I  really like that you get credit for checking in. Love the mochas, tried the almond croissant today...yummy."
Peet's Coffee,"WARNING:Not a Charger- friendly coffees shop. You’ll have no electricity to all ya devices. Nothing wrong about the coffee nor service, they were good. 0 To all the charger outlets that all off, they dont want u to work here, you  r expected to spend and LEAVE!"
Peet's Coffee,I started going to Peet's after they closed all of the Starbucks locations in close proximity to my job. They give fast and friendly service and the coffee is better than Starbucks tbh!
Peet's Coffee,"Super Nice and since it is my Go-To place, they even take the time to remember my name. Overall A+++ Fast Service and Quality of Coffe and food.  - Super fast and always Smiling, On point here!"
Peet's Coffee,"Good place to take a break from the busy Market Street. Pavement and window seating. There's a balcony inside which offers a view of the coffee shop, not the street. The coffee is good. There is the option to get a ceramic cup if you wanna be waste-free. Can be a bit of a wait to be served. #letsguide  #localguides"
Peet's Coffee,The upstairs is pretty nice for studying but the outlets don't work and the wifi kinda sucks. Also its kind of cold so definitely bring a sweater if you're staying a while!
Peet's Coffee,"Good coffee but one restroom wasn't working and the other didn't have soap. Worst of all, there are no working plugs in the store to charge your laptop or phone. Mediocre experience, room for improvement."
Peet's Coffee,"Coffee in its natural state is bitter and disgusting, kind of like a 90-year-old lech who's paralyzed from the neck down. The Havana Espresso makes it into a 50-year-old James Bond played by Sean Connery: suave, smooth and inexpressibly sexy in a non-creepy way that only he can pull off. If there's outdoor seating available, please be aware that this, too, is a ""No Smoking"" area."
Peet's Coffee,"This is the old Coffee Bean. Peet's did a fabulous job remodeling this site and now this is a two-story coffee house.  New fixtures, excellent customer service, good music, good pastry selection, and great coffee.  What's not to love?"
Peet's Coffee,"The company lost a star by having more pastries than a breakfast bar at a Willy Wonka factory but a single bagel offering. Get a clue, Pete. Whole grains are healthier than processed sugar. How they lost the second star and inspired me to write this review is that I yet again had to explain that when I ask for something toasted, I don’t mean that I want warmed in a toaster. I want it brown. If I had wanted it warmed, I’d have used that word, not the word ‘toasted’."
Peet's Coffee,"Fast service, good coffee, fair prices"
Peet's Coffee,"I have to admin I might have been lucky. It’s a run of the mill place but we sure got a wonderful coffee experience! Wouldn’t have expected it, truth be told.  I welcome anyone to try it out. We only went there once. For sure would come back!"
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee! Great place
Peet's Coffee,"The coffee is Peet's standard good and the staff is friendly, but the location and some of the traffic is more than a little zany."
Peet's Coffee,"Most of the staff are very nice but the girl who was doing the coffees where rude above the acceptance limit. Besides, the croissant was cold and heavy. Next time I will cross the road to Starbucks"
Peet's Coffee,"Great location with quick servers and uncommon, for downtown, outdoor seating, with heat if you sit under the storefront awning.  And most importantly, the regular brewed coffee is great."
Peet's Coffee,Iced Coconut latte is amazing!!
Peet's Coffee,Good coffee to take out
Peet's Coffee,"My go-to coffeeshop when in downtown San Francisco. Service is quick, good coffee as usual, and they have outside seating, which is great! Only downsides are the dirty bathroom and slow wifi."
Peet's Coffee,"Always the best Peet's I've been in so far. Copious seating with all ""'crow's nest"" upstairs too! Located directly on Market St.yet set -back enough to avoid the whole race-track vibe that main thoroughfare can sometimes have. Pick up coffee then get a ""Beard Poppa"" custard pastry, or vise versa and you still can't go wrong. Enjoy!"
Peet's Coffee,"Great place to take a breath and a well done beverage. I enjoyed the plant based sandwich it's completely vegan, I definitely recommend the place and the vegan sandwich."
Peet's Coffee,There is a lot of open space here.  I think it's the best place to have coffee (The cocoa is also very good) & people watch.  The altitude of the atmosphere can be amplified by an attitude of gratitude!
Peet's Coffee,"Great coffee, No problem to use your own cup, which is not the case everywhere. Oat milk and soy options."
Peet's Coffee,"I love Peet's, especially since i gave up espresso coffee. They make great chai lattes, much better than their competition (who shall remain nameless). And I love their chorizo flatbread and blueberry/blackberry scones. My only real gripe? You get one point per visit no matter how many items you buy. I usually split the orders when my family and I go."
Peet's Coffee,"Has good customer service and quick serving time. The coffee was not as per my taste. But if you love bitter coffee, it's the place for you."
Peet's Coffee,What happened- a few years ago this used to be the best place to get coffee!!! Coffee was fair at best. The staff were professional and nice and did go out of there way to get things right.
Peet's Coffee,Racist white security at peets tells only colored people to leave the business and I'm a peets rewards guy but not anymore ....peets was ok til the hired security now its no good anymore.  I guess ill be going back to 711 and get me coffee til he's fired....... lots of people will know how racist that security guard is  Thanks to both of the managers they are on my side and support me awesome.   That security guard with the tats all over his arm (he has white skin)yeah that's why I'm making this bad review other than that. The other security guard he is black and isn't like tat jack
Peet's Coffee,The coffee shop founded in Berkeley. I like it! Outdoor seating. Soy milk and wifi available. Ask for real mugs to avoid waste!
Peet's Coffee,The usual high quality coffee that I have come to expect from Peets.  Nice upstairs seating area is comfortable and gives a little break from the hectic street scene just outside.
Peet's Coffee,"I had the caramel macchiato and it was amazing. A lot cheaper compared to other coffee shops, too."
Peet's Coffee,"Its good,  but outside area should be better monitored, we were the only ones sitting outside drinking coffee.. a lot of loitering and one guy was actually selling weed two tables over from us!"
Peet's Coffee,"Dante is the kind of person I want working for me. In a situation that was not his fault at all, he stepped up and took responsibility for another barista's mistake. This is the kind of strong character I want in my supervisors."
Peet's Coffee,If you take cream in your coffee you will have an ice coffee when served coffee at this location in the winter. Peets coffees are notoriously luke warm when served and Corporate Peets is too paranoid to even reheat it for you. They try by adding a fraction more coffee to the top. As if.
Peet's Coffee,"Great coffee in a great location. Market Street,  San Francisco"
Peet's Coffee,Out of mint tea :( the flavor they gave was gross
Peet's Coffee,I love the Assam tea that the Peets coffee sell. Although you wont find in all the stores. I love it and this outlet had it. Made me happy .
Peet's Coffee,"Staff are friendly, drinks are always good, I love Peet’s coffee and its drinks. I highly recommend this brand."
Peet's Coffee,"Best coffee, nice environment, great hospitality"
Peet's Coffee,"Revealed as a must when coming out of powell stop, has wifi, good seats, good view. Not what an italian would prefer at all but it worth it!"
Peet's Coffee,Don't go to Pete's on 16th st. or 9 th st. they're not very  friendly at all they said to me you always come in here. They don't want to take care of me. I'll never go to those establishment ever again. I heard what one of them said wasn't very nice.
Peet's Coffee,One of the best coffee chains anywhere. Always good service.
Peet's Coffee,We're glad to hear that you love our coffee as much as we do! We appreciate you sharing this wonderful 5 star review.
Peet's Coffee,The Dark Chocolate Holiday Mocha was delicious especially paired with a almond and butter croissant! Peet's is always a winner in my book they're local.
Peet's Coffee,"A very disappointing Peets. Poor quality (tasteless and weak) specialty drinks and coffee. Great service and atmosphere, but not enough for a Peetnik to return!"
Peet's Coffee,"Friendly service and good coffee, however do not expect to get work done if you require WIFI. Connection and stability is terrible."
Peet's Coffee,"Was ok, people nice enough, let me use restroom. Didn't buy anything but from the strong aroma I instantly knew why people were in love with the place."
Peet's Coffee,"Great place! Excellent coffee (everything very nice) and attention, conveniently located, very comfortable."
Peet's Coffee,"Very average experience. Plenty of homeless sitting outside taking up their tables, but it is SFO. The oatmeal was so bad I had to throw it out."
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee. Delicious pastries. Very friendly staff who radiate goodwill - a rare quality these days.
Peet's Coffee,Lets keep them going. Great coffee and  location!
Peet's Coffee,"Convenient location,  dependable cup of coffee."
Peet's Coffee,typical SF staff. order ahead but wait as if you didn't while you watch them BS with friends. It's hot out. why are you wearing a cap?
Peet's Coffee,"Great location with lots of seating! However, not sure if it is common, but the WiFi was extremely slow on my visit."
Peet's Coffee,"Coffee was ok, nothing special to be honest. The cafe could be a bit cleaner, especially the outside sitting area is not very welcoming (tables are used down and the floor is messy)"
Peet's Coffee,"The coffee is just great. However none of the power outlets nor the internet worked, staff seemed careless about it."
Peet's Coffee,"place got updated recently but still accessible for the homeless population of San Francisco. good coffee and tea, kind personal"
Peet's Coffee,"I really enjoyed their traditional cappuccino. They are very friendly. Next time in in town, I hope to return."
Peet's Coffee,Tasty coffee and oatmeal and great that they're open from 6:00am!
Peet's Coffee,good coffee ... awful matcha. Artifical customer service.  This isn’t chacha-matcha of soho nyc or even close so don’t get matcha here...
Peet's Coffee,There's nothing not to love about Peets Coffee. It's the best in the world; wherever you buy it. And my favorite is... Garuda!!!
Peet's Coffee,Great environment and very fast service. Coffee was excellent in flavor and quality.
Peet's Coffee,"Love the atmosphere, but outlets didnt work, so couldn't charge my battery."
Peet's Coffee,"Non-existent WiFi and neither do any of the power sockets work. Good coffee chain, but not at this location."
Peet's Coffee,Bruno had an awesome attitude. Made my day brighter
Peet's Coffee,"Great coffee, will definitely be back"
Peet's Coffee,"If you enjoy the experience of having a good coffee, avoid this place. The worst coffee i have had in sf"
Peet's Coffee,Great coffe and a lovely terrace; great spot for people-watching because it's busy out on the street most of the time :)
Peet's Coffee,Your best choice! The champion of breakfast!
Peet's Coffee,I had a wonderful cup of coffee there while waiting for my dog to get his shots at Petco.
Peet's Coffee,Great customer service. Coffee tastes great too
Peet's Coffee,It can get really busy here. It’s not a cozy place. Very cold and stark. Service is good though.
Peet's Coffee,"Great tasting black coffee, not burnt/bitter tasting like a lot of coffee chains."
Peet's Coffee,Very nice
Peet's Coffee,Simply the best coffee is San Fransisco
Peet's Coffee,"Racist staff, if the coffee was OK the actions of the clerk made it sour. I would recommend the Starbucks that is crossing the street."
Peet's Coffee,"Eli rang me up today and made my entire day!!!  Saw him bring a smile to every customer he helped, I would hire him if I could, thanks Eli !!"
Peet's Coffee,I requested for no foam...I had too much foam. I requested extra hot...matcha was not hot enough.
Peet's Coffee,I thought they were very friendly and the service was good. No pretentiousness here at least for today.
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee and great people. Very nice place. 👍 …
Peet's Coffee,"I go for morning coffee at Peet's, One California, big highrise at the start of the Financial District. Here is the scene outside."
Peet's Coffee,They cut the power as another reveiwer wrote. What sort of coffee shop charges 4$ for an Americano and then cuts the power?
Peet's Coffee,"No crowd, fast polite service on a Sunday morning."
Peet's Coffee,"I love Peet's anyway, but this location is especially nice. The staff is friendly, well trained, and efficient."
Peet's Coffee,"Very good coffee, upstairs seating. Never too busy."
Peet's Coffee,Very amazing taste
Peet's Coffee,"150% better crowd, & a more down to earth service then those pinko's in the green shirts...."
Peet's Coffee,"Paid $3.35 for a tiny cup of so called cappuccino. Bitter dishwater, nothing like cappuccino. Utter rubbish, avoid"
Peet's Coffee,Easy going atmosphere.
Peet's Coffee,Went most days when on holiday.good coffee and nice facilities. Recommend
Peet's Coffee,Wonderful experience from great warm staff who are ready to serve and brighten up your day

Peet's Coffee,Great coffee store excellent atmosphere good service. Internet also.
Peet's Coffee,Good!
Peet's Coffee,"Had a nice latte and brownie, good place to sit and get some work done"
Peet's Coffee,Quick fast friendly service. I ordered a ice tea drink and it was mixed well with plenty of ice.
Peet's Coffee,"They make tea with boiling water: the only chain in the US I've ever found that does. Oh, and the pop tarts..."
Peet's Coffee,"For about the same $, why would you go to the Starbucks across the street?"
Peet's Coffee,Good place to quickly grab a coffee with nice almond crossiant.
Peet's Coffee,Friendly employees.  Great coffee.  Outdoor seating.
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee and food
Peet's Coffee,Coffee's great! Furniture logistics desperately need to be improved.
Peet's Coffee,Staff was so friendly and upbeat. It made for a good start of the day.
Peet's Coffee,They have cut the power to outlets in this coffee shop to prevent people from using their laptops here.
Peet's Coffee,Items there upon arrival and both were nice and hot... perfect...
Peet's Coffee,"Nice coffee on Market street, close to the Marriott Hotel, where you can have a seat"
Peet's Coffee,Good coffee and a great place to do some work!
Peet's Coffee,The best coffee in the center of SF.
Peet's Coffee,Good coffee shop!
Peet's Coffee,Baristas need training and pastry was old.
Peet's Coffee,"Great coffee, nice place and friendly staff."
Peet's Coffee,Aged a decade waiting for my coffee.
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee and croissants
Peet's Coffee,I like to use their wifi.
Peet's Coffee,Best coffee and great atmosphere LOVE it!
Peet's Coffee,"The best coffee and croissants I had ever had, anywhere in the world."

Peet's Coffee,The bacon frittata is delicious. Free wifi is also nice. I visited around 8:30 am and the place was almost full and I didn't see any homeless people.
Peet's Coffee,"I waited a long time finally waited Didn't get it right two times in a row Then the name is not clear, ask him what he said he did not know redo and do wrong I'm going crazy 😭 How hard is a cup of matcha milk to understand what are you doing"
Peet's Coffee,If you buy it with a standard cafe in Barcelona the two stars are generous.
Peet's Coffee,"Alternative to sturbucks peet's Coffee offers its customers a wide selection of desserts and drinks to start the day in the best possible way. A nice positive note is the presence of soy milk for those allergic to milk and lactose and some proposals for vegan desserts such as peanut butter cookies or brownies. For those who are not allergic, it is possible to find a wide choice of desserts including excellent berry muffins. Prices in line with sturbucks"
Peet's Coffee,"Passing by, saw a lot of customers sitting outside drinking coffee ☕️"
Peet's Coffee,"The coffee is a bit sour, so I think there will be some likes and dislikes. When I ate in San Jose, I thought it was less, so it must be a jumba restaurant. There are a lot of homeless people on the second floor, so please sit on the first floor. Everything else was soso. He doesn't even express himself to come to take an order, and the server is a bit vague.. Is he originally blunt or maybe.."
Peet's Coffee,"A spacious shop with a sense of openness. The amount of drinks is twice as much as in Japan, so if it's not too much, S size is enough."

Peet's Coffee,"Great coffee, but very sweet! Remember to tell the clerk to adjust the sugar level."

Peet's Coffee,"There are power strips, but none of them seem to have power. Wi-Fi is also available, but it was weak and unusable. I like the location and atmosphere of the store."
Peet's Coffee,"Despite having fewer options than Starbucks, in my experience, the products offered are better and more affordable. Attentive and patient staff."
Peet's Coffee,"One of the few American cafes I've enjoyed to be honest, very nice place"
Peet's Coffee,Americano is delicious. It has the acidity of cold brew. The medium size is about a Starbucks tall.
Peet's Coffee,"The coffee is okay, but it's not cheap. In addition, the WiFi does not work, nor do the plugs. And there are no bathrooms."
Peet's Coffee,"Great place for iced coffee Plus, the best part is that you can use free wifi."
Peet's Coffee,"2⭐ for the server who never listened to me, that I had to take back 3 times because he didn't put me the right cakes, and in the end I ended up with a cake and a drink that didn't weren't the right ones...in short, otherwise the drinks are good and the lemon poppy seed cake is excellent."
