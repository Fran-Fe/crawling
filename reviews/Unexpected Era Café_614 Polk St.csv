Unexpected Era Café,"There's excellent service in this clean, pleasant cafe with great drinks and a small assortment of foods.  I asked about pastries and the person behind the counter recommended the raspberry turnovers. I also ordered a hot chocolate and dined-in. Three minutes after paying $9.89, I got my turnover and hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate was chocolatey, not over-sweetened, and creamy. The lady told me that it might not be sweet enough and she could sweeten it more if I liked, but it turned out to be perfect. The raspberry turnover was cold in the center and the pastry wasn't flaky. The worker asked how everything was and I asked if she could heat up the turnover a bit more. She offered to give me another one, but I insisted on heating up the one I'd already taken a bite out of. A minute later, the pastry was pretty good.  If you're in the area and you'd like a great hot chocolate or an espresso drink this is a pleasant place to visit. I appreciated the pleasant service and I'll return for a hot chocolate if I'm nearby in the future."
Unexpected Era Café,"If you're looking for a place to chill while waiting for a friend or an event, but you don't want to deal with Starbucks on market street.  Unexpected Era Cafe is a welcomed replacement w/ High top seats to give your feet a rest.  It's a downhill walk from Saigon Sandwich on the way to the subway so it's definitely a convenient location, and It's clean here.  College student level pricing as well."
Unexpected Era Café,"Stopped in with some friends to grab a quick coffee while visiting SF. Super cute little takeout spot with great basics, but be sure to check out their extended menu for some fun options. Tried the cold brew and the mocha, both delicious. Best part was the barista - he was so friendly and we had a nice chat while he made our drinks. Great spot!"
Unexpected Era Café,Thank you for stopping by and we are happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the drinks!
Unexpected Era Café,"I make my way to come out to this little coffee shop on Polk. The owner truly cares about coffee and you can tell, the coffee rivals that of other third wave coffee pleases and it’s nice to find a truly independent owned shop with a great owner you can chat to about it all. Stop by if you get the chance!"
Unexpected Era Café,First ever review of any place. I loved the coffee and the pastries. I will be coming back as soon as possible. If you don’t try them out… you are missing out.
Unexpected Era Café,This place has great vibes. The guy behind the bar was super chill and makes you feel taken care of. The cinnamon mocha was the best drink I’ve had in a while... definitely a new regular spot for me.

Unexpected Era Café,"Great little family-owned coffee shop! The owner is really knowledgeable about coffee and teas! I shared I had to give up drinking coffee due to health stuff and the owner helped walk me through some non-coffee drink options. I had never tried a matcha before but decided to try one and glad I did! If you’re in the area, definitely check this spot out - you won’t be disappointed!"
