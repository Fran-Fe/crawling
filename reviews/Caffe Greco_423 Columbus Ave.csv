Caffe Greco,My favorite coffee spot in SF.  Carlos and the team run a great operation.  I go there every time I visit the city.  Coffee is high quality and the menu items are special.  Try the bagel w/ lox.  Seating on the sidewalk on Columbus Ave is great for people watching.
Caffe Greco,"I've been to this cafe about 3 times in the past year. I wish I lived closer and would definitely visit more often if I did. This last time, I wasn't sure if they would be open since it was new year's eve, but I still wanted to check, so my boyfriend and I went. They were open on new year's eve! I got my hot chocolate and carrot cake (someone took home the last 2 slices of tiramisu while we were in line.) Really nice spot to go to when alone or with friends or after dinner while on a date. Just make sure to have cash with you."
Caffe Greco,"My husbands favourite coffee place in SF, such a great vibe. Yummy tiramisu and cannoli"
Caffe Greco,"This was a perfect spot after a day walking around and exploring the city. Got an affogato, Italian soda and a dessert. It was exactly what we needed. Perfect place to recharge and relax. I’m definitely coming back."
Caffe Greco,"Quite a nice spot for a coffee or tea along with some quick bites. Particularly on a cool evening, it's a perfect respite to warm up and keep your chats going. The selection of drink options is solid though a few more snack and dessert options might be nice."
Caffe Greco,Stumbled on this spot on our way to the water. Feels like you’ve stepped into Europe. Buzzy atmosphere with a warm neighborhood feel. Breakfast bagel was delicious! Delicious and simple but somehow elevated.
Caffe Greco,amazing food and service! the inside is very pretty and chill! 10/10 place definitely recommend it!
Caffe Greco,"The coffee is delicious here, one of the best tiramisù’s in my life I found it here"
Caffe Greco,"Went there 3 times on our 5 day trip... Either just to enjoy a coffee and dessert or for a delicious breakfast sandwich, staff was so friendly and attentive!"
Caffe Greco,Great breakfast and coffee. Service was fast and friendly.
Caffe Greco,Fantastic quality from the coffee too the biscotti cookies to the deserts. It's almost as if I was transported to Italy or somewhere else in Europe with the authenticity of the food. I can't wait to come back for more.
Caffe Greco,"Large cafe/brunch joint in the heart of Little Italy. Offers a variety of coffee, drinks and paninis. Fast free wifi, cash only. Their grilled cheese chicken panini was decent, nothing particular."
Caffe Greco,"Great place to grab a hot drink or a sweet treat. We stopped in after seeing The Illusionist show nearby. It was pretty popular and about 80% full inside and out with people at 9pm on a Friday. Mixed crowd if I had to guess. Some older locals with books and chatting it up which was so nice to see. And of course a bunch of tourists wanting a sugar or caffeine fix. (Not a tourist myself in this situation, but I got both!) They care about their drinks offering multiple options for substitutions like soy milk and almond milk for your drinks. Thumbs up from me!"
Caffe Greco,"They are not ADA accessible to start. I took my mum who is on a walker here because I always had a great time, but we were shuffled to a side area with the server giving  an attitude. We are then told it would be cash only which is ridiculous. With the North Beach Festival on I suspect the restaurant didn’t want to pay taxes as the event is a cash cow.  A shame that this has left a bad taste in a City that is known for inclusiveness. I will need to have a serious think before I go here again or recommend it to others."
Caffe Greco,I always enjoyed my hot drinks here and the ice cream was yummy. My favorite is the Hazelnut flavor. Thank you to their attentive staff that kept this place clean and tidy.
Caffe Greco,"the prettiest and coziest café in sf. the servers are all so friendly and nice. amazing coffee machine and the coffee is incredible, literally the best! but you can only pay cash, so bring enough money to try all of the amazing cakes and waffles"
Caffe Greco,Amazing coffee and fabulous cakes and tiramisu that words cant describe. Much better than the place down the street on the corner where the hipsters go. This is where the locals have coffee in the am. Great pastry shop right across the street also. This has been our daily am coffee stop this whole week on our vacation.
Caffe Greco,"We had the falafel plate and the spanakopita. Both were ok but really lacked seasoning - especially garlic. The humus was excellent. The kazandibi also lacked, needed more vanilla. The kunefe was quite good.  Not sure I’d go back."
Caffe Greco,"The hot chocolate here is phenomenal! They also serve it in some of the largest mugs I've ever seen a cafe use, so the price is well worth it. The desserts I've had - tiramisu and the coconut macaroons - are mouthwatering without being too sweet, and, again, you get fairly large portions, which helps justify the somewhat pricey treats. If you're looking for something sweet after a walk around North Beach or a few slices of pizza in Little Italy, I definitely recommend you stop by!"
Caffe Greco,"Large coffee menu and plenty of treats in the case. We shared a piece of cheese cake, slice of brasiliana and sacrapatina. All were rich with flavor, great balance and large slices. Today was cash only or we would have added a few more treats to share. Not sure if cash only is the norm."
Caffe Greco,"Great spot for a pasty and coffee, especially in the am for some people watching. Make sure you have cash!"
Caffe Greco,"I ended up having breakfast here twice during my stay at at nearby Washington Square hotel. The staff are amazing—friendly, courteous and helpful. The coffee was delicious. And the food was amazing. Highly recommend. They only take cash, so come prepared."
Caffe Greco,"I don’t leave reviews often but I live right around the corner…. Decided to swing by, and was pretty disappointed. Was $6 for mocha. I got it iced with oat milk instead of regular milk. They charged me like $1 extra for ice? It’s frozen water that’s free for them with an ice machine. They also charged extra for the oat milk. Coffee came out to no joke $9 and was maybe 12 oz at best. No chocolate inside either literally tasted like regular coffee.  Just felt like it's really not worth the more premium price."
Caffe Greco,"During my trip to San Francisco, I made two stops into Caffe Greco and would have made more if I had more time. This is the perfect spot to grab coffee, gelato, dessert, whatever you want in an atmosphere you can just sit, relax, and hang out in.  The first visit was in the morning just to grab some coffee. My sister and I grabbed two caffe lattes & my boyfriend ordered the white caffe moca. All were delicious! The white caffe moca is a little sweet for my liking, but the taste of it was certainly enjoyable.  We stopped in again a different night, as they are conveniently open late. We ordered three hot chocolates, a cup of creme brulee gelato, a cup of spumoni gelato, a slice of sacripantina cake & a slice of chocolate kahlua cheesecake. The hot chocolates were tasty. The gelatos were to die for! So creamy and flavorful and a prime highlight for us. The cakes were the only disappointment. We previously had sacripantina from another nearby cafe which set the bar extremely high on our expectations. The kahlua cheesecake was pretty dry and just fell flat for us. Not to fret though, we still loved this place & thoroughly enjoyed everything else.  One tip to note, and honestly, a big disappointment due to the inconvenience is they are a cash-only business so plan accordingly if you're going to stop in."
Caffe Greco,"We have been coming here for years, love the dessert and cafe selection. It's retained it's North Beach vibe and is the perfect spot to people watch, relax or come with family. It's a tradition that I hope to continue for years to come."
Caffe Greco,I came here in sweats because of a recent assault… I don’t dress up in the city anymore. Was clean and kind and was treated like trash here. Denied a bathroom after purchasing coffee and food and glared at til I left. Decent place if you don’t care how employees treat others that may not look like millionaires. Usually a lot of people reading books here… Otherwise there’s better options.
Caffe Greco,This place could be insanely good but the traffic it gets brings that potential down a notch. Definitely overpriced and only takes cash. It is a self service place so you're on your own. The cappuccino was ok and the tiramisu was good.  The location is what you pay for. Amazing.
Caffe Greco,"I'm a regular but not really satisfied - music is set and rarely varies.  Coffee is very good, but the food and dessert offerings are just okay and high priced.  Very few power outlets for laptop use and those are not always functional. No heat so in chilly S.F. this place is usually cold (bring your warm gear if you get cold easily)."
Caffe Greco,"I came for the Tiramisu, but their deserts looked so good, I decided to try their Sacrapantina and their Brasiliana. Both were really good, although I enjoyed the Brasiliana just a little more. Their coffee with steamed milk was really good too. The only reason I didn't give this place a full five stars is because the ambiance is very dated."
Caffe Greco,Recommended by friends and came by for the Tiramisu ($25 for 4). It is very creamy (some how like melted ice cream) -- Not sure why it is in such different from other brand but we were to told to put it in refrigerator for couple days to be the best.
Caffe Greco,"I didn’t eat any food here but had to write a review of the white hot chocolate because it was just that good! I had never even heard of it but it was so delicious and a must try in San Francisco. If you want a soda, the Greco Sunrise is also fruity and delicious!"
Caffe Greco,"Amazing place. My husband was here 20 years ago and it still the same tasty, friendly and nice."
Caffe Greco,"Lovely neighborhood cafe in North Beach. No fuss no frills, a good hang out place.  Great coffee, pastries, paninis, salads and breakfast dishes. Excellent service and reasonable prices. They have indoor and outdoor seating."
Caffe Greco,"Very nice place nice friendly people variety of deserts ,coffees and more … must try place in North beach I would definitely recommend .thank you"
Caffe Greco,Definitely tasted much better tiramisu cakes before!
Caffe Greco,"Amazing food and great service!! This is just an amazing place to go to at any time! Good breakfasts, good lunches, and good dinners! All in all, if you're near, stop by. It's great for a quick break."
Caffe Greco,We came for a latte and ended up with their AMAZING home-made ricotta cheesecake!! It was still warm from the oven!! To die for❤❤ We even went back the next day for another slice!!
Caffe Greco,Best macchiato that I have had in the US. The flavor was amazing and the temperture on point! My husband had the affogato and it was delicious too!
Caffe Greco,Does remind us of Italy when we visited this place. A tip would be to order a small cup of latte because the large size is too much.
Caffe Greco,Very cute Cafe located in little Italy. Beautiful details and a friendly service make a visit an experience. The coffee is so good. They offer waffles? Sandwiches and eggs.
Caffe Greco,"This is probably the worst latte I've ever had. It's like drinking flavoured water. Ordered with oat milk, pretty sure they mix water into it perhaps to save on oat milk which is ridiculous when they also charge an extra buck for alternative milks. Stay away from this place if you want to enjoy your coffee!"
Caffe Greco,"Caffe Greco's Affogato and Tiramisu are a match made in coffee heaven. Together, they deliver an unforgettable culinary experience that will leave you craving more."
Caffe Greco,Caffe Greco is a heavenly cafe that serves authentic  espresso drinks and pastries. Their staff is delightful and very welcoming. Caffe Greco is always a treat to sit and enjoy good coffee.
Caffe Greco,Latte was great but my Brasiliana chocolate cake was too sweet for me.
Caffe Greco,"When you make people stand in line, don’t decide tip for yourself. You can’t keep their due change and force it in your jar!! It’s wrong at every level. Remember it’s about service. Pay your workers and raise the rate if you are short on money."
Caffe Greco,Unbelievably good. I have found my happy place.
Caffe Greco,Coffee was excellent and the service was excellent. It's just really pricey. $7.00 for a 16 oz late is a bit much.
Caffe Greco,Great coffee! Service is kind and fun. We had Greco Grande and Cappuccino + Lemon Cake and Walnut Coffee Cake. Great atmosphere. Nice music. Would recommend. Planning to come back! Enjoy!
Caffe Greco,Afogato was delicious. Was hoping for tiramisu but they were out. The staff were very friendly. Nice outdoor seating available now.
Caffe Greco,"Frozen in time. Great place to work, grab coffee.. good hot chocolate. Staff is welcoming.!"
Caffe Greco,One of my favourite Italian pub cafes in San Francisco! They have delicious hot chocolate and cakes!
Caffe Greco,"Tiramisu is fantastic, along with a cup of their coffee au lait goes well together here.  Service can be very slow when busy.  Nice atmosphere to soak up."
Caffe Greco,"Cozy, chill atmosphere. Has wifi and bathroom. Ask the people at the front counter for the wifi password."
Caffe Greco,It's a great little cafe to enjoy North Beach and people watch.
Caffe Greco,"You know it’s gonna be amazing when they take cash only…. Good vibes in the second room for studying, and open late in SF? Instant 5 stars"
Caffe Greco,"The location is so stunning. Tables outside very european. I had a pastrami sandwich which was delicious and chocolate, good prices. I enjoyed outside with the sun."
Caffe Greco,"Nice spot for a coffee in North Beach. Tables on the sidewalk are great for people watching, the coffee is strong and well made (Illy brand). Servive was also efficient and friendly. Didnt try any of the food."
Caffe Greco,Must have the coffee. I got an oat milk cappuccino. The desserts look amazing!
Caffe Greco,"Reliable North Beach cafe.  Has an Italian cafe vibe.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  Great for people watching, and reading.  Has an array of sweets to offer as well as coffee and sandwiches."
Caffe Greco,"You want to remember your trip to Italy ? A quick trip oversees with no luggage or passport ? Stop by this place, once you do, read this review again. My combo: espresso ( they use high quality fresh Illy beans, homemade chocolate biscotti, and the best for the end … “Sfogliatella” ( puff pastry with lemon filling )"
Caffe Greco,"A charming, cozy cafe/restaurant. I went here for dinner with a friend. We got a tasty black bean salad (although I thought it was overdressed it was still yummy) and the hummus avocado sandwich w tomato and sprouts.  The man (owner?) who rang up our order was super friendly and kind.  We ordered a slice of pie and he HOOKED it up with HELLLA whipped cream, it was so sweet (literally and figuratively).  If you want a friendly, sunny, tasty experience check this spot out.  p.s. the prices were decent, for San Francisco anyway. Good music playing, dub/reggae when we went"
Caffe Greco,Crave for Italian coffee and dessert. My white mocha..is very good. Cannoli...and Tiramisu..are one of the best I have ever tasted...very nice service..my wife love afrogato..my friends love their cappuccino
Caffe Greco,"Such a fun and central cafe in little Italy! This location includes authentic Italian coffee. We lucked out with the beautiful weather in February, so it's a great time to people watch."
Caffe Greco,Nice cafe with a large sidewalk terrace. Good for people watching while eating a panini and drinking a coffee/wine/beer. Reasonably priced for SF. Recommended.
Caffe Greco,Beautiful atmosphere and amazing staff. They only take cash so get those greens ready. They make an amazing chai latte and hot chocolate for the kiddies! Plays beautiful acoustic music. Would come everyday if I could.
Caffe Greco,"Great atmosphere, good coffee but they only accept cash."
Caffe Greco,"Snarky baristas here are as permanent as fire hydrants; don’t pee on them ;  the owner is a glad hander and back slapper ;  he thinks he is The Godfather whose soundtrack is played repeatedly. Other than this, this is a great place ! Try instead Stella bakery opposite this cafe ; convivial service with attention to detail on making cappuccino.  My favorite patron here sits outdoors and drags deeply on his perfumed cigarette with visible pleasure, his eyes blissed out. I want to smoke what he smokes."
Caffe Greco,Had a cake and cappuccino greco grande. Both were delicious and at decent price
Caffe Greco,Two large White Mocha Latte and two Cannolis and small bag of some sort of chocolate tip cookies $40+ only wish the cannolis were larger.
Caffe Greco,"Fast yet cold service, staff were blunt and not very welcoming. Coffee was very average, food was presented well however, egg white was under cooked, generally the food was underwhelming. Atmosphere sitting outside was nice."
Caffe Greco,"Had the eggplant panini, cappuccino, and ricotta cheese cake while sitting outside and people watching.  Delicious and relaxing."
Caffe Greco,"Cash only, but had the selection of Italian sweets and amazing coffee. Would go back just to sit in the sidewalk and people watch."
Caffe Greco,"Hands down the best tiramisu in San Francisco. Light, airy, the espresso flavor is not too strong. The Lady Fingers and mascarpone are soft and fluffy with lots of cocoa powder. Caffe Greco is pretty much open from early morning to midnight. Neighborhood Italian coffee cafe that has been around for decades. Time has stood here in a great way. The place, quality of coffee and desserts have not changed. If you can grab a table outside, grab it. It's like taking a mini-vacation. Great coffee, homemade Italian desserts. Your blood pressure will drop. The people watching here is awesome. Cash only. There is an ATM machine next to the register."
Caffe Greco,Stopped by to have a coffee and ordered a cappuccino and it was delicious. My wife and I went to Rome a few months back and it was spot on. Definitely recommend for authentic Italian coffee. They do not accept card but they do have an ATM in the caffe!
Caffe Greco,"Caffe Greco is my first stop in San Francisco every time I come to visit. Over the last 10 years that I have been going there, the tiramisu has never disappointed. I always order atleast a couple. This is as local as it gets, and is almost never filled with tourists.  I almost want to keep this place a secret but it’s too good to be kept hidden."
Caffe Greco,"The coffee is good (they use Illy for their espresso and Cafe Trieste for their brewed coffee). The dessert (cakes and ice cream) are just ok, so I would recommend not passing on the dessert. Come if you want to chill and relax sitting outside watching cars and people go by.  Cash only."
Caffe Greco,"I thought it was the most unique café. I had a lovely cappuccino with my family and we shared dark chocolate dipped biscotti and coconut macaroons. Delicious, nostalgic, and perfect."
Caffe Greco,Old school espresso/bakery/cafe in North Beach.  Highly recommended.  Indoor and street side seating. Busy but worth the wait.
Caffe Greco,"Not that Cafe Grecco isn't inviting enough on its own to warrant a stop, but we had to leave a 5 star review after having one of the most enjoyable mornings on our trip while here. The atmosphere, quality of coffee/food, authentic service, and location/outdoor seating is everything you'd want in a Cafe in San Fran. Whether you're a local or on a trip, this is worth the time to stop and enjoy yourself."
Caffe Greco,I unfortunately had already eaten so didn't partake of the food or drink but the people I was with seemed happy with everything. They did say everything in SF was much higher in price than other big cities they've visited.
Caffe Greco,This is a great place to come and hangout with friends or go alone and get some work done. I've done both and both times I've enjoyed my visit. The staff were very friendly and outgoing. The cappuccino foam was heavenly.
Caffe Greco,Great outdoor sitting area with views of North Beach night live. Affogato and dessert not bad at all.
Caffe Greco,"I love this place. Pastries are better than most one finds in North Beach, IMO."
Caffe Greco,"Italian bar in the Italian district, with a lot of guests. The pastries are good, as well as the coffee. One single espresso is 2.75 usd, but it is very good"
Caffe Greco,"It was not fancy coffee shop as I imagined , but the tiramisu and coffee were really great. It is easy to get a seat in  Coffee Greco, and it is CASH ONLY!"
Caffe Greco,"Cafe Greco is a unique experience, located in the heart a little Italy. Fabulous coffee great place to sit in people watch. Wonderful safe neighborhood ( disclaimer always safe when I'm there) My kids often did their homework utilizing very fast Wi-Fi. Great neighborhood coffee shop tell me what you think."
Caffe Greco,"I've tried a bunch of cafes in the area over the years and this place is hands down my favorite cafe. Lots of seating. Great for people watching. Coffee and desserts are delicious too. I used to live in the area so whenever I visit I make it destination to sit down, enjoy a cup of Illy and gnosh on gelato."
Caffe Greco,Friendly service. Noticed wife Japanese and said hello and thank you in Japanese. Great flavor in coffee and fast service. Nice seating near street.
Caffe Greco,"Super nice cappuccino, latte, and torte. I enjoyed the environment, too, including on-trend music."
Caffe Greco,Loved this cafe. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I just went ga ga over their coffee :) They do not accept credit cards only cash. A must go
Caffe Greco,Really good gelatos and fun place to come for a dare or just wirh family . Alot of music around
Caffe Greco,"This is a traditional Italian style bar: no trendy or modern design, no frills or long list of ""latte piccolo macchiato"" nonsense a la Starbucks...  Just plain simple amazing espresso, cappuccino and traditional deserts. Try the cannolo, the tiramisu or a nice affogato. You won't be disappointed."
Caffe Greco,Great place to stop for coffee and dessert in North Beach.
Caffe Greco,Food is not good here for the price . Also I found hair in my bagel ...disgusting! One guy at the counter also takes only cash...
Caffe Greco,Classic coffee shop at North Beach. Pleasant ambiance. Great place for people watching. Friendly staffs. Loved the Braziliana dessert. Relatively affordable overall (won't break the bank 😉).
Caffe Greco,The coffee was decent. The cafe is cash-only which was a bummer.
Caffe Greco,"A friend of a friend recommended Caffe Greco to me, I tried the croissant sandwich with mozzarella and tomato and it was buttery, flaky and outstanding. This sandwich and Caffe Greco have been seared into my memory and become part of my personal San Francisco experience."
Caffe Greco,We are in 2023 and the only accept cash… if you don’t have it they have ATM that cost 3 dollars for transaction.
Caffe Greco,"They don't have a terminal to pay, asked only cash It's not possible in 2023 to exist like that"
Caffe Greco,"Fave place in North Beach (where so many classic restaurants have closed 😞 ) for espresso and dessert or a glass if wine outside on a sunny day. ""Don't forget the Cannoli!"" …"
Caffe Greco,Worst Tiramisu i have ever had. It was watery with no coffee taste whatsoever. Felt like they used whipped cream instead of marscapone. How incredibly disappointing!
Caffe Greco,"Had the gelato sundae, two vanilla lattes and a slice of tiramisu. Great sundae. Decent lattes. Ok Tiramisu. Great atmosphere and open late. Great after a slice at golden boy around the corner."
Caffe Greco,Always fun coming in here and having a coffee. The workers here are always so sweet!
Caffe Greco,"I ate an omelet, was very tasty. Decent prices and very good service"
Caffe Greco,Nice cozy atmosphere and excellent quality coffee
Caffe Greco,Cash only :( Otherwise the ricotta was delicious and the coffee was decent too.
Caffe Greco,"Great cappuccino, mild, creamy and toasty. Beautiful day for a hot cappuccino."
Caffe Greco,Best Latte iced and hot. Get it in house with real cups. Sandwiches are amazing also!!
Caffe Greco,"before moving, my dad raved about the best gelato he ever had… chocolate gelato from cafe greco in SF. safe to say yes, it is one of the best. she is sweet and very much traditional chocolate gelato. make sure to have cash on you as they are cash only"
Caffe Greco,Incredible chai tea!!! Incredible creme brulee gelato! Beyond 5-stars!!
Caffe Greco,Their hot chocolate ♥️ And perfect if you wana spend a summer noon while reading a book. And the interiors are super vintage. Be sure to have some cash on hand. Cards don’t usually work.
Caffe Greco,"We had to lined up in the evening, when we got to the cashier found they did not accept visa or debit, just cash. There was no notice to find out the rulls and avoid waiting for a long time in the line. I think it was overrated cafe. The quality of the pastries was ok,not so good."
Caffe Greco,"Amazing coffee, even better desserts!"
Caffe Greco,Good coffee! They only accept cash.
Caffe Greco,Very delicious coffee & desserts .. friendly staff ... Remember to bring Cash with you to be able to order ... Little Italy
Caffe Greco,I think this cafe is a nice place. I really enjoyed the cheesecake and cannoli.The thing that concerned me was the bathroom it doesn't even lock but other than I think it is a nice cafe.
Caffe Greco,"Excellent coffee, decent ambient, but * cash only * which is a deal breaker."
Caffe Greco,"Amazing friendly and hard working staff, the decor reminds me of old cafes in Italy. It's a great spot for working or meeting as it's generally not busy/noisy. I wish the pastries, coffees and food were up to Italian standards of quality. They are ok but not great."
Caffe Greco,"Caffè Greco is my favorite place for a cappuccino in Little Italy. The baristos are hilarious and friendly, speaking to me in Spanish and Italian and making a killer cappuccino. There are tons of great places for coffee in the area, but I always go to Greco for the environment on top of the  caffè buonissimo."
Caffe Greco,"Great coffee, good people, good vibes.They've got more than your typical selection of coffee."
Caffe Greco,"Delicious tiramisu that beats away afternoon fatigue. Beverages were also good, speedy and friendly staff and nice cozy atmosphere."
Caffe Greco,"Couldn't believe the absolute lack of service and respect. Asked for the receipt which he reluctantly gave, than noticed they wanted to charge $7:00 for a medium coffee. Asked the server why they didn't have the prices? They guy got angry and returned our money and asked us to leave! Incredible! If you want a tourist trap an want to be screwed. Stay. If you want the same thing at 1/3 the price go across  the street to Stella Pastry, and you can pay with your credit card. Easy!"
Caffe Greco,"Good spot in the middle of North Beach. Cash only, FYI"
Caffe Greco,This is a must go coffee shop that anyone should visit. This old coffee shop make you travel in time with their unique and old style. I orderd an americano which was dark and strong as I like and my party ordered hot chocolate that they enjoyed. we ordered cannolis with our drinks and in my case it gave me a little of sweetness that went well with my bitter dark coffee.  The place is nice and clean and also you can enjoyed the outdoor tables to contemplate people passing around with their dogs.
Caffe Greco,"The worst coffee of my life. I don't know what it was, but I had ordered a Latte😐 …"
Caffe Greco,Went this morning to this institution caffe I knew years ago for a quick breakfast: ordered 2 eggs and ham over muffins and a almond croissant. Eggs where over cooked and muffin where hiding over a old piece of cheese. My croissant was maybe 2/3 days old and hard to chew on! Anyhow this place is going downhill
Caffe Greco,"Walked in to order food. They told me no more food, when the sign out say’s Served all Day"
Caffe Greco,"After trying nearly all the Canolli in North Beach, I do declare Greco is #1"
Caffe Greco,"The last time I was there, the employee picked up my pastry with his dirty bare hands.  Some of the staff could learn to be friendlier as well. The decor and ambience of the place are nice, but just make sure to watch when they go to serve you."
Caffe Greco,"CASH ONLY. But besides that, amazing food and coffee in this cute artisan coffee shop. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Try the Salmon bagel and cappuccino! Lovely staff, and locals and regulars were treated like family. Great place to go!"
Caffe Greco,Definitely one of the North Beach’s staple..
Caffe Greco,Delicious tiramisu and great coffee that comes with friendly service.
Caffe Greco,They can't make a proper cappuccino which is so basic. Way too hot to drink+ bitter taste+ won't make a breve+ no foam. Very disappointing.
Caffe Greco,Coffee was great. Panini had to be abandoned because they only take cash!
Caffe Greco,"Such a charming cafe! Tuck away in the city, and be immediately transported to Italy. Great food. Great vibe. Bring a book and just be."
Caffe Greco,"Great coffee. Great location right on Columbus. I've been going there for 20 years and the place retains its charm. Sitting outside definitely brings back memories of old Europe. Between the great coffee, excellent cakes, people watching, historic buildings across the street and outside air, the place has the whole package. The staff was very friendly and attentive to boot. I believe it's still cash only."
Caffe Greco,The Cannili n café latte was fabulous n delicious! I love North Beach at night. Viva Italy 🇮🇹 n Mona Lisa 🧡 …
Caffe Greco,"My cappuccino and my son's cake were good. My friend's wife's chai latte is more latte, less chai. The batista was very helpful though."
Caffe Greco,Very yummy cheesecake. I liked the music playing in the cafe. I saw people working on their laptops also.
Caffe Greco,"This place is cash only. Beware of frozen tiramisu. I was so excited to try their desserts, but their tiramisu had frozen ladyfingers layers with pieces of ice, and cream was basically tasteless. Frozen biscuits and melted cream do not make a good combination neither in texture, nor in taste."
Caffe Greco,"Just started coming here earlier this year because my favorite cafe closes a lot earlier than Cafe Greco does. The staff are very friendly and most days welcome you with a smile. I come here because they're one of the few cafes that serve the best cakes in North Beach! I love their Brasiliana and the Tiramisu is great too! The coffee is not as strong as I like but it's okay, especially with their cakes!"
Caffe Greco,Casual and small. A nice place to relax and have a quick snack
Caffe Greco,The food was very good and there were many choices that were yummy
Caffe Greco,Simply one of the best double espresso in San Francisco.
Caffe Greco,There is no way to call it America !!!!! While sitting here you feel full enjoinment with very and very delicious food !!! IMPRESSED !
Caffe Greco,Really good breakfast in San Francisco
Caffe Greco,Very friendly and cozy. Food was great too!
Caffe Greco,This is a nice Italian cafe in North Beach. Spacious seating area with free WiFi and outlets. I had the latte and shared a cannoli with my girlfriend. Everything was delicious. Italian music and oldies are serenading the patrons at this shop. Friendly staff. Cash only. Nice ambience in this place and great place to spend some time on a lazy Sunday.
Caffe Greco,"Great coffee, good people, good vibes.They’ve got more than your typical selection of coffee."
Caffe Greco,Great coffee but the best chocolate tartufo i ever had!. Pls keep in mind they only take cash. However there is an atm
Caffe Greco,"Had a late night coffee and dessert here! Loved the atmosphere. Heads-up, it's cash only!"
Caffe Greco,"CASH ONLY: Good food and really cute outdoor seating. Real reason to come is for the coffee though, good variety and well brewed."
Caffe Greco,"Italian cafe with drinks, salads, coffee and more in the bustling centrer of North Beach. Be prepared to self serve by ordering inside/taking outside to your table. Lots of folks walking by for a quasi- see & be- seen atmosphere."
Caffe Greco,Nice spot to sit down for a coffee or snack in North Beach. They had good nougat though a bit overpriced.
Caffe Greco,Great place to enjoy a coffee outdoors. Snacks are delicious  It's a nice place to relax and do some people watching. No one hurries you which is great. It's a good meeting place. Price is not above the average in the neighborhood.
Caffe Greco,Good if you're Greek.
Caffe Greco,Tiramisu is delicious! Friendly staff
Caffe Greco,Always superb coffee and yummy Tiramisu
Caffe Greco,"The Tiramisu was alright, a bit on the soggy side. The affogato was nice. Great place to hang out with friends."
Caffe Greco,Great atmosphere.  Friendly staff and excellent blackberry Cabernet gelato!
Caffe Greco,"Nice n cozy place with amazing selection of pastries,  Gelato, beverages and italian desserts."
Caffe Greco,The best cannolis I've ever had and the cappuccino was amazing....
Caffe Greco,"Stopped by for dessert on a weeknight. We had the ricotta cheesecake and a cannoli. They were both very good. The coffee was OK, not great. Steamed milk for the latte was not quite hot enough. Flavors were well balanced, textures were good. The cannoli is filled when you order it. This is an excellent way to do it since the shell gets soggy if it sits with the filling in it. Nice touch. Overall, this is great little spot for dessert in North Beach."
Caffe Greco,"I'm a little bewildered that I've been coming here for over a quarter-century and somehow have never left a review; mind blown.  Caffe Greco is a North Beach institution, and one of the reasons that I wanted to live in this San Francisco neighborhood. It exudes the same vibe I recall from spending time in countless neighborhood cafés around Italy, from Cortina to many Roman piazzas.  The pastries and cakes are varied; all I've tasted have been satisfying.  Their coffee drinks — usually a macchiato or cappuccino for me — have always been a delight; my ""madeline"" if you will. In these pandemic times they're served in a paper cup rather than the heavyweight ceramic of better days, but this too shall pass.  I'll be heading back to North Beach shortly, and Caffe Greco will get another visit. Friendly and helpful staff just drives home the deal."
Caffe Greco,Fantastic panini and coffee! Owners are very friendly also. Great outdoor seat area.
Caffe Greco,"My run too when all the Cafe's have closed down in North Beach District. I like their hot chocolate and chocolate cake, but there mochoas are good too...  Nice front patio and parking let for hanging out and having a smooth cup of jaw dropping coffee..."
Caffe Greco,"Cash only. Scrumptious paninis. The staff are very fast. I was here on a busy day, and my fabric was ready in less than two minutes. It came with a nice side salad. Decent selection of beer and wine fir such a small place. They have outdoor seating available and a whole other room with more tables through a door by the main entrance."
Caffe Greco,"Very nice staff but watch out, its cash only-amazing tiramisu and a nice place to work, extra seating in the room next door. Have breakfast+lunch food, outside seating, cakes and some alcoholic options."
Caffe Greco,"Note quite a replacement for our beloved Cafe Puccini which burned down, but very good."
Caffe Greco,"While strolling North Beach, this spot can’t be missed"
Caffe Greco,"Great place to enjoy coffee and dessert.   A bit pricey,  but not exorbitantly so."
Caffe Greco,"The only good thing about this place is the brand of coffee they use for their drinks. The atmosphere is that of an old coffee shop that's unmaintained and dirty. The baristas are disorganized and take too long to fix drinks, there are no napkins around, no individual sugar packets but sugar in bulk that you spoon in your coffee with the same spoon as every customer, and a few spoons that are used and thrown in a container with water that everyone uses - very unsanitary. Desserts are not fresh and they taste like cardboard. Not a good experience."
Caffe Greco,"In an area full of authenticity this place stood out as being functional (I am a fan of Illy coffee but it's everywhere in SF) but highly unauthentic, especially with a waiter who didn't know what a cannolo was.  The place itself was pleasant but if you want as genuine experience as you can get I'd suggest picking somewhere else."
Caffe Greco,"This place serves some great Italian desserts and espressos, and it's busy throughout the day. The staff is very polite. Some have said that it's a good place for studying or working, though I contend that it's too noisy and bustling for that. Instead, sit outdoors or by the window to watch the passerby, while you savor your espresso, your tiramisu, and the presence of your companions."
Caffe Greco,"Really enjoyed their late night atmosphere. We sat down for their cafe latte and a piece of tiramisu, which were both really food. There was line that moved pretty slow but the service was friendly. The price is standard for the neighborhood and seating was easy to get."
Caffe Greco,Always LOVE Caffe Greco! One of our top 3 espresso caffes in North Beach. I'm wheat flour allergic and the great staff helps direct me to what I can eat!!
Caffe Greco,I love coming here on Sunday mornings before going to the St. Francis of Assisi church across the street.  They have patio seating on the sunny side of the street so you can enjoy the warmth while people watching.  My go-to breakfast is their granola with yogurt and fruit and a medium cappuccino.  The granola is tasty and crunchy and they top that with creamy yogurt and sliced strawberries and bananas.  YUM!  I've also had their croissants and tiramisu - both were delicious.  The waiters are always so nice and helpful.  Great service.  Cash only.
Caffe Greco,My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. It is my second favorite coffee in SF. It is a shop that offers plenty of seating inside and some outside patio too. Their coffee is delicious and you have to try their desserts.  Added bonus because they offer a non-dairy milk for those who are lactose-intolerant.
Caffe Greco,Great spot for breakfast or a late night tiramisu. Good quality food and friendly service.
Caffe Greco,"Wonderfully authentic espresso spot. Got a quick, quality espresso and a small covered table outside to enjoy it on the sidewalk and people watch. Great spot."
Caffe Greco,Absolutely delicious cappuccino and caffè latte
Caffe Greco,Wonderful  breakfast and coffee choices.  The pastry choices were good too.  Good prices for our family of five.  The staff was friendly and the service was great.  I would definitely come here again.
Caffe Greco,"Great place, good portions. Remember to bring cash to pay there."
Caffe Greco,Great local spot!  Had a delicious hot chocolate & some panforte.
Caffe Greco,"Cash only cash only cash only! This is one of the few original coffee shops in North Beach. Good quality coffee and pasteries, excellent European style cafe with plenty of seating. Reasonably quiet as well, did not have to yell my order, like we did at cafe triest."
Caffe Greco,"Nice location, coffee is ok. Nothin special"
Caffe Greco,Very delicious& Rich in taste🥰 …
Caffe Greco,"My favorite café is the entire world so far. I have been coming here for over fifteen years and every visit is just as good as the first. Perfectly prepared cappuccino, espresso, and coffees. Paired with Italian desserts and treats, with WIFI and outdoor al-fresco seating. Excellent for conversation and people watching. Prices are worth every penny. Highly recommended."
Caffe Greco,I love Cafe Greco. This was an old school meeting spot for when some  friends showed up from out of town. Hasn't really change one bit. Love the coffee and sandwich's are on poin💯❤ …
Caffe Greco,Caffe ' Greco it's like a very strong warrior. It gets better and better with time. Great place for a magnificent espresso. Brings back wonderful memories. 😉 …
Caffe Greco,I was here 4 months ago and had an excellent cup of coffee and house made tiramasu. It a very nice place to stop on my rest day when I was bikepacking the west coast!
Caffe Greco,"Greco has probably been around for longer than you’ve been alive. They have consistently good pastries and good coffee available all day and a good bit into the night, but unfortunately that has made them into a bit of a north beach staple. Expect a crowd. If you manage to find a time in which there isn’t one, take advantage of it."
Caffe Greco,"What a Cafe! Fun staff, and the best egg and cheese on a croissant I've ever had!"
Caffe Greco,Nice cozy cafe with amazing desserts
Caffe Greco,"Friendly staff, decent setting. Ok coffee if you like dark roasts."
Caffe Greco,Nice and cozy place on columbus ave. Seating arrangement was good. Staff was super nice and quality of food was amazing. We ordered egg and cheese sandwich with crossaint. Cappuccino was well made.
Caffe Greco,"Lots of seating for a cafe and has wifi. Also has outside seating which is great to  people watch in North Beach. Decent tiramisu...light airy, not too sweet or cakey but could use more rum and espresso in the ladyfingers. But it could have been because I got the corner piece which may not have gotten all the soaky goodness."
Caffe Greco,They only accept cash but expensive I feel but it is good.
Caffe Greco,"great portions, good coffee. the best part is the people watching!! they have these floor to ceiling windows, and columbus is just a very popular street. they've also extended the outside seating, so you can be indoors or out. love coming here with friends or by myself."
Caffe Greco,"Good ambience. I enjoyed the cider Abe cake. … they hide their WIFI info, and the customer service is ok at best."
Caffe Greco,"Decent coffee house with ample space &  seating in two rooms. Enjoyed their lattes & mochas-which are served in nice tall glasses. They carry a variety of italian pastries & cakes such cannoli, tiramisu, & sacripantina. Also, they sell Illy ground coffee in their signature cans. Overall a good spot to have a cup of coffee after dinner. Cash only!"
Caffe Greco,AUTHENTIC Italian coffee house with baked good and gelato. Only accepts case but great place to sit in Little Italy. Recommended.
Caffe Greco,I had a biscotti and an espresso. Awesome. Great service.
Caffe Greco,"Service was fast and members were nice. Coffee was just ok, a little on the pricey side but what can you expect from SF, right? P.S.: they only take cash."
Caffe Greco,"Salad had more flavor than my Chicken Zucchini Panini. Also, bummer they don't have waiters, U have to get up and go inside to counter each time you want something..."
Caffe Greco,"Easily the worst coffee I've tasted in years. Asked for decaf but it hit me exactly the way I didn't want to leaving awful aftertaste. Even cream was weak. They didn't have half-n-half, just milk and it was pretty diluted. Not coming back"
Caffe Greco,"Best coffee in the city! My Father who was a cop in SF for over 30 years and his buddies would go here everyday for coffee on their beat. Been going here since I was a little kid. Great service, great atmosphere and delicous coffee.  My personal reccomendation is the Greco Grande *"
Caffe Greco,This cafe is located in little Italy. The decor was inviting. Customer service was friendly. Their cuppicino was superb. My friends sat in the side walk patio and  enjoyed the cool weather.
Caffe Greco,Best café latte ever!
Caffe Greco,Good coffee. Great experience cruising the North Beach neighborhood. We enjoyed a traditional Italian dessert I can't find any where else. People watching is great here
Caffe Greco,Tiramisu was too soggy :(
Caffe Greco,Only accept cash. Very bad.
Caffe Greco,Charming looks but cappuccino was watery and tasteless and candle filling tasted like whipped cream. Lemon cake was good.
Caffe Greco,"Good Illy coffee, beer, wine, great atmosphere.  Always busy when I get here sundayS arroua 6:00, but always a seat.  Pastries are not the best.  I wish they would find a better bakery."
Caffe Greco,"Always a great experience, coffee, service"
Caffe Greco,We were greeted by a very friendly man who made the best cappuccino. The food was delicious and the almond pastry was excellent!
Caffe Greco,"no longer quite the place where San Francisco gathers, but still a spot where you can have a coffee and talk with a friend not a laptop ghetto."
Caffe Greco,"Our capuccino was burnt, which was pretty disappointing considering that's why we came. My husband was a barista and said it tasted like the beans were ground too course. The chocolate cake was great."
Caffe Greco,Cozy and authentic. Made great sandwiches and espresso that reminded me of Europe.  Lots of locals were there and plenty of tables to sit and unwind for a little while.  Nice staff and on-par prices.
Caffe Greco,Had a delicious hot chocolate here.
Caffe Greco,"The frothy cafe au lait transported my friend back to Paris! The sfogliatelle filled authentically with slightly sweet, orange-flavored ricotta made me want to order another.  With plenty of seating indoors and out, we enjoyed a relaxing Sunday morning breakfast. Quick, friendly service. Delicious food.  If only I lived here, I would be back to try their gelato and tantalizing desserts."
Caffe Greco,"DO NOT GO HERE FOR PASTRIES.  Go to Mara's (it is a few blocks away) if you want a Italian Pastry.   The coffee here was good, but that is hard to mess up.  We had the Canoli's from Greco and they were absolute dog crap.  You can tell the person who made them had no idea what a real Canoli tastes like."
Caffe Greco,"Great gelato. Wanted to try coffee, but didn't realize it was cash only- there was a sign near the register with the WiFi, and after we were told cash only, I looked back a moment later, and it had been turned around to announce cash only. Would have been nice to know before going in."
Caffe Greco,An Italian style coffee bar of superb quality. Great choice of coffees and pastry at reasonable prices. Nice staff. Definetely a recommendation in North Beach.
Caffe Greco,"Great coffee, excellent pastries and a wonderfully friendly staff! Oh and a nice cafe setting."
Caffe Greco,Nice food and coffee. Expensive but tasty
Caffe Greco,Caffe Grecco is a great place for a good cup of coffee and they also have very good hot chocolate. The variety of pastries is very low but they do have so good desserts. The service is very good and I would definetly reccomend going to it after dinner for a nice sweet treat.
Caffe Greco,"I just don't understand ""cash only"" places this day in age....really inconvenient and if someone in our party wouldn't have had enough cash for all of us than we would have had to go somewhere else. Decent breakfast, coffee and mimosas though."
Caffe Greco,Great place to enjoy a cup of coffee with delicious food. I had pouched eggs with salmon  suggested by Juan the cashier and it was divine. Definitely coming back!
Caffe Greco,"This spacious caffe in the heart of Little Italy has an ambience that makes you dream of the mediterranean sea, warm spring days and just good coffee. The experience is complemented by good wifi and lovely music. Would totally come back here for work (tables may be a bit too small for 2 laptops tho) or to just relax with a friend."
Caffe Greco,"Ordered tiramisu and coffee and the tiramisu was top notch, all flavors balanced and similar to the one I had in Florence :)"
Caffe Greco,"*Cash Only* Still my fave place to crash and plow through an inbox or catch up on reading. Lots of tables for heads down work and Illy espresso drinks in addition to a nice gelato and pastry selection. Don't don't miss the home made tiramisu!  For nice days, take your coffee out to the sidewalk seating and take in the North Beach vibe. Or, if you've already satiated your inner bookworm from a purchase from legendary City Lights Books down the street, no better way to page through your new literary acquisition than over a warm mocha at one of Greco's tables."
Caffe Greco,"I got the chai latte, and it was incredible. The creamy texture and light flavor were perfect to distract from my date that was tanking at the time. I'll be back again to try the tiramisu."
Caffe Greco,"Loved this place back when $9 pasta was a luxury, and still love it for nostalgia's sake. If you're looking for fine dining or in town for just a few days, go elsewhere, but locals should all give Greco a try."
Caffe Greco,"This is a ""Must visit"". Great coffee and friendly staff. It's almost like I stopped to visit with friends and family. I will return every time I'm in town. And that tiramisu was simply out of this world!"
Caffe Greco,"Great coffee.  Took home a bag of homemade macaroons, but they were dry.  Super nice staff and owner."
Caffe Greco,"First of all, cash only, so be sure to have it. Great cafe for drinks, we got a cappuccino, a blackberry cabarnet gelato which was amazing along with a Braziliana which is chocolate cake soaked in expresso with cream which was great. Great atmosphere as well as a friendly staff."
Caffe Greco,"What a great little piece of Europe. Loved everything from the ambience to the mind-boggling array of options.  The price is pretty decent too, considering the neighborhood and how upscale this cafe is. A break from America for a bit!"
Caffe Greco,"Espresso (Illy), which I almost always drink black, was up to snuff. However, the volume of the double shot was perhaps a bit excessive. Service at the counter could be improved, as a customer ordering directly from the barista I didn't feel very welcome."
Caffe Greco,"Great Cafe Mocha, the best teramasu I've had. Ham and cheese crucent good."
Caffe Greco,"Lots of seating and decent tea and coffee. Be sure to browse the dessert case! Seating is available outdoors too, even on rainy days as they have a canopy above the sidewalks!"
Caffe Greco,"Perfect coffee, perfect croque madame (they refer to it as poached egg panini). Best place to eat a yummy breakfast without making a fuss.  The place is really casual and cash only"
Caffe Greco,"Best thing here is their latte. The tiramisu is amazing as well. Just to cap it all off, the gelato was amazing. Plaenty of plug points for you to work on your laptop. My favorite cafe in North Beach."
Caffe Greco,"Cafe Greco is a great local place  for a cup of coffee. However, it does not offer very many pastries. The decor is good though, as it offers great inside and outside seating with a view."
Caffe Greco,Old school cash only charm with rare late hours for SF let down by subpar espresso and dated dining
Caffe Greco,"I cannot visit San Francisco without stopping by Caffe Greco for some coffee and dessert. If possible, I'd park myself in a seat there and stay the entire day, working my way through the dessert menu and drinking cup after cup of excellent coffee."
Caffe Greco,"Delicious coffee, and yummy pastry treats. Cash only, prices are fairly reasonable. My favorite cafe in Little Italy!"
Caffe Greco,"Go for the tiramisu and cannelloni! Just go... you'll love it! Oh...and don't forget a latte, too. Wonderful atmosphere makes you feel like you're back in old San Francisco."
Caffe Greco,The probably best chocolate cake I ever had. When you go there make sure to have a slice. Its also a relaxed atmosphere.
Caffe Greco,Been going there since late 80s. Love that I see the same crew for many years now. Love Caffe Greco. Going business picks up during these troubling times.
Caffe Greco,"Either in the afternoon or an after dinner caffe Greco is really good for coffee/dessert while watching people pass by. Usually packed with angry older Italian men arguing over something (in a cute Italian way), tourists and couples. Sit outside for if you like people watching.  The coffee is good. Get the affogato and forget about the calories for a moment. The desserts are also good here, Tiramisu and cannoli are great.  One of my go to cafes in Little Italy."
Caffe Greco,Enjoyed some delicious gelato and a cookie at the cafe seating out front on Columbus
Caffe Greco,"Wonderful cakes and coffee flavors. Brought overseas friend and we both enjoyed the outside sitting and the great coffee. Remember, CASH ONLY"
Caffe Greco,"Great spot to go after lunch/dinner for desserts, coffee, or tea.  Plenty of seating indoors as well as small tables with chairs outside on the walkway."
Caffe Greco,"Consistently tasty desserts and pleasantly pungent, strong coffee and coffee drinks.  Tables are kinda wobbly and it's neither a wonderfully comfortable nor intimate place, but it's got character."
Caffe Greco,"I only had an espresso machiatto but it was well done with just enough foam and a tiny, tiny hint of milk to round it up. The staff were helpful too."
Caffe Greco,Beautiful Outside seating is quaint and perfect for hearing and seeing the sounds of San Fran. Food was well prepared. Salmon was delicious. Thank you
Caffe Greco,"Great place with nice sitting area, but I came out a little disappointed with the Braziliana dessert: the cake part was dry, and even though creme was great, it was still FROZEN. :/"
Caffe Greco,"Wonderful little cafe with delicious espresso / cappuccino. Excellent service and a great selection of traditional and delicious Italian deserts (Tiramisu, Cannoli, Biscotti, etc...)"
Caffe Greco,***Try the Chocolate Bannana Bread Pudding*** & you'll become an Addict & get arrested :-) They only make 2 pans a day of it & when its gone its gone. Even saying you're the new Mayor (who is it?) won't get you a piece when its gone. Good sammies & great deserts.
Caffe Greco,Amazing. But bring cash!
Caffe Greco,"Obviously the closest official coffee shop you’ll get to Firenza, IT. Get a large cappuccino, not a small, you’ll thank me later bro/bra.  Only downer is CASH ONLY... it’s ok guys I’ll pay your taxes for the IRS because your coffee is so good!"
Caffe Greco,"Amazing gelato, I recommend the mint chip. The espresso is also really good. Definitely come here if you're looking for desert in the area."
Caffe Greco,"Good Coffee, Only downside is that its cash only, but come on, its a mom and pop shop, so what would you expect? Expect coming here for Great Coffee! Bring cash though"
Caffe Greco,"Great place with Illy brand coffee and some of the best desserts in the city. Gelato, cannoli, tiramisu, cheesecake, ect.  Nice seating outside as well. Ciao."
Caffe Greco,Excellent sidewalk cafe for Italian pastries and coffee. Lately I’ve been drinking a double mocha.
Caffe Greco,"Bad biscotti (stale?). We didn't know there could even be bad biscotti. Large, watery espresso shot in the latte made it dilute and watery (to be able to use less milk?).  If you go here, do it for the atmosphere."
Caffe Greco,Perfect for a breakfast ! Large choice of hot beverages and the pastries were freshly made and delicious
Caffe Greco,Classic North Beach Cafe experience.... the best coffee
Caffe Greco,Best cappuccino in the city. Nice outdoor and indoor seating. They speak Italian and Spanish here. Cash only.
Caffe Greco,Nice place. Food is tasty. Only cash but there's an ATM close to the caffe.
Caffe Greco,Seriously love this place. If u don’t consider coming here then u just missed the best Italian cafe there is in all of SF.
Caffe Greco,Excellent cappuccino and great fast service. The pastries look outstanding - I'm sad I'm to full to try any. Next time for sure
Caffe Greco,"Best cannolis ever! Everytime we come to San Francisco, we stop by this place and have never been let down. It's like a bit of heaven. One note..."
Caffe Greco,Amazing coffee. Great sweets!
Caffe Greco,"A real Italian-style coffee, the staff is super friendly and I warmly recommend a Greco Grande cappuccino and their Prosciutto-Caper-Tomatoes Croissant."

Caffe Greco,"Cappuccino and breakfast panini excellent, service fast, staff friendly and cheerful. A nice place to hang out with friends or get some work done."
Caffe Greco,"Cash only.  Couldn't buy what I wanted. Very expensive.  Crowded, limited outdoor seating."
Caffe Greco,The place for me was average... the waiter confused my husband's order even though we repeated it twice and the Gelato was more a regular ice cream.
Caffe Greco,Humble and not fancy. Hard working and polite servers. Great coffee and the Tiramisu is the best.
Caffe Greco,The best place for tiramsu and caffe latte.  No other place does it better than this place. The tiramus is very fresh and ready to eat.  Try it and you'll always come back for more.
Caffe Greco,"Easy spot for tea/coffee. Cannoli was fresh and crunchy; several gelato options, other dessert selection is limited."
Caffe Greco,Have a macaroon. They are fantastic.
Caffe Greco,I love coming here for the great coffee but avoid the Croissant
Caffe Greco,For the past 10 years Caffe Greco has offered the best affogatos and mocha's. Always consistently good.
Caffe Greco,"This Italian coffee place may be the best coffee in North Beach, and perhaps the best in San Francisco. Enough said. The place is CASH ONLY."
Caffe Greco,"Good coffee, good desserts, good ambiance. Cash only.  We love it."

Caffe Greco,This is a fab cafe. Busy but great coffee and the food was really yum. It had such a lovely vibe that I stayed for ages.
Caffe Greco,"Excellent atmosphere, the outside seating is reminiscent of cafes in Europe. Great place to grab a coffee and snack in Little Italy."
Caffe Greco,"After eating across the street at Calzones, I was in the mood for dessert and Caffee Greco caught my eye with the gelato. The gelato  and the cannolis really hit the spot."
Caffe Greco,This place was decent for its gelato. They only took cash. The restroom didn't have any toilet paper.
Caffe Greco,"Excellent service, great ambience, and delicious cafe latte. It's the perfect place to relax and enjoy a beautiful Sunday morning."
Caffe Greco,Their lattes are really good.Their cakes are delicious. The service is friendly. Parking is a bit tough.
Caffe Greco,"Panini sandwiches were OK, a bit greasy. Side salad was wilted and past its prime. Cash only (which is odd given the prices there)."
Caffe Greco,Ice cream was amazing ordered spimoni ice cream and large white chocolate cafe mocha. Everything was delicious and service was quick.
Caffe Greco,"Always one of my favorite places to go in San Francisco.  The service,  the coffee, and the pastries are all perfect!"

Caffe Greco,Inviting and a lot of offerings. Seems popular with the local crowd. However they only take cash. Don't be caught off guard.

Caffe Greco,It’s the best breakfast/ brunch caffe in SF!!
Caffe Greco,"Proper coffee and patisserie. Great people. You lose one star because you only take cash. Come on guys, it's 2020."
Caffe Greco,Nice place to sit outside and enjoy an afternoon glass of bubbly wine.
Caffe Greco,"Good enough, but very expensive. Machiotto 3.50, just ok espesso. Cannoli was good but around 5 bucks."
Caffe Greco,$3 for an 8 oz glass of hot water with a basic twinings tea packet. Worse is they then want $1 for an extra 8oz of hot water.

Caffe Greco,Good espresso and great cannoli! Don’t forget your cash!
Caffe Greco,Get there early to get the hot scones!  Great coffee too.
Caffe Greco,Barista was careless. my espresso was clearlly over extracted. He also did not level the coffee before tamping it which makes coffee was not level inside.
Caffe Greco,"Expensive and mediocre. 17 bucks for 2 coffees. The people that work there are nice, but that doesn't justify the price."
Caffe Greco,Best coffee place in little Italy!!! You must try the cheese cake and cookies! The only downside is that is cash only!

The coffee here makes you feel like you used to have coffee in Paris, France or Italy. Dine at a seat on the terrace overlooking the road  I ate here twice on my weeklong itinerary.  The famous menu is a sandwich with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and the croissant topped with scrambled eggs is also highly recommended!"
