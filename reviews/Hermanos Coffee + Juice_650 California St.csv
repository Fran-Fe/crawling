Hermanos Coffee + Juice,Coffee shop in lobby of offices. Large area space. Not enough seating for the large area but still nice. Love loved the vanilla latte. Made with homemade vanilla syrup. Yum. Delish.
Hermanos Coffee + Juice,"Nice, spacious coffee shop with a cool vibe. Kinda threw me off at first with the house music, but helped me focus to get work done on the computer. The juices were really good if you like ginger (I love it). Pretty much every juice has ginger in it."
Hermanos Coffee + Juice,Great location in the lobby of 650 California.  The Ritual coffee is good as well as the several juices I have tried.  They also offer pastries which my co-workers give good reviews although I haven't tried them yet.
Hermanos Coffee + Juice,Thank you for the feedback Lindsey!
Hermanos Coffee + Juice,"Located on the lobby of 650 California building outskirts of FiDi/Chinatown. Open M-F only and plastic payment is welcome. Feature bean is from Ritual and pastries from Starter Bakery of Emeryville CA. They're not limited to drip in airpot thermo, but pour-over V60. Staff are friendly with genuine smiles and service is quick. Limited counter bar seating with outlets to charge your gadgets. You can literally take your coffee break without leaving your office building."
Hermanos Coffee + Juice,Thank you for your business Albertino!
Hermanos Coffee + Juice,"Aubrey, Jennifer, Phil and Alisha are Rock Stars!  The pour-over coffee (Ritual) is delicious; the nitro cold brew and the nitro black tea are perfect for a refreshing pick-me-up; and the pressed juices offer a lively non-caffeinated option.  The service is top-notch; they are very friendly and welcoming."
