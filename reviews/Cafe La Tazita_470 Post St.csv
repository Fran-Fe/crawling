Cafe La Tazita,"This is a very small cafe which serves a full hot breakfast and coffee, both to go. The cafe has a small table in the window, and a few seats opposite the counter where you order. In addition, there are some seats upstairs in the cafe as well. The coffee menu is good, and the coffee machine is also good. We tried a small cappuccino with an extra shot, a classic macchiato, and a regular medium size cappuccino. All the coffees were very good, and we enjoyed the flavor of the coffee. Prices are average for this area of SF. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for our coffee, because the friendly barista was alone taking breakfast orders and preparing coffee and other beverages. We found the waiting time too long, even if the coffee was great."
Cafe La Tazita,Cozy little place with upstairs seating. We ordered Mexican Mocha (one of Them decaf). Hot with just the right amount of spice. Will come back for breakfast when in the area again.
Cafe La Tazita,"Cute, cozy coffee shop with friendly atmosphere, nice staff, good food, good prices and a nice 2nd floor lounge area. Great place to grab a coffee and get some work done. Coffee was really terrific for how affordable it was, recommend the mocha blanca!"
Cafe La Tazita,Great breakfast options—I got a burrito with chorizo and fresh bell peppers. It was excellent. Good coffee too.
Cafe La Tazita,went back in january with family and we loved it!! this little cafe is very authentic and very cozy! the staff was very friendly and the service was fast! the woman who took our order was bilingual so we appreciated that! the turkey club was very good and so was the chocolate muffin! would definitely come back when in the area again! 😸
Cafe La Tazita,Had the Valencia breakfast burrito in a spinach tortilla and it was the bomb . Expect a huge yummy portion!
Cafe La Tazita,Thanks for the kind review Pranav! Hope to see you again soon
Cafe La Tazita,Service is very friendly and everything seems to be made fresh! We had 3 of the breakfast burrito specials and the California chicken sandwich with fresh juice and an Iced Latte! They were even able to substitute things for us as me and my siblings have a food allergy! Additional seating is available on a mezzanine upstairs. Very well setup shop with excellent service.
Cafe La Tazita,"Stayed at the Westin for a conference in the same block and ventured out for breakfast. $25 bought fresh OJ, great cup of coffee, a delicious scramble, potatoes, and toast. Sat upstairs. The staff was beyond friendly. The decor is plain. It’s a slip of a place…maybe room for 10 downstairs and 15 up. But delicious and a worthy find."
Cafe La Tazita,Hi Colleen We appreciate the 5 star review. So glad you enjoyed your visit with us. We truly appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts. Thank you 
Cafe La Tazita,"A great place for breakfast, they have fresh (and I mean really fresh) bagels, very good coffee and also a vast assortment of other breakfast classics with eggs, bacon, toast etc. The place is small but has a great seating area upstairs as well. It is superclean and the owners/the staff are very, very friendly. This is now my go-to place for breakfast when I am in San Francisco."
Cafe La Tazita,"I don’t know how 1 sandwich and 1 dessert pastry cost me $30, but it did. I can’t say that the taste justified that price tag. My sandwich was pretty good but the dessert was awful."
Cafe La Tazita,"Cute cafe, close to Union Square with friendly staff. They have plenty of seating options and an upstairs area with outlets. I had the Brentwood Scramble burrito and an iced mocha, both were delicious. I will be stopping by again if I am in the area. Highly recommend!"
Cafe La Tazita,"Bagels for the morning were delicious but also some of their sweet bars, the one with pecans, and chocolate coconut, I bought and brought back home… they were super tasty. Followed the young lady’s advice and warmed them up a bit before we ate them and they were explosive in the mouth."
Cafe La Tazita,Great service & PHENOMENAL food! We got the Brentwood scramble burrito and the valencia scramble burrito with homemade chorizo. Definitely worth trying!!
Cafe La Tazita,Cute café not far from union Square. A great alternative to the hotel breakfast. Expect the usual cafe fare plus a rather expansive food menu. We also got sandwiches to take away and have for lunch... Highly recommend!
Cafe La Tazita,"Great for lunch!!! Very nice staff, really good food."
Cafe La Tazita,Great local food! A small shop busy but service was fast. We had Breakfast there. sandwich and salad were fresh and delicious.
Cafe La Tazita,"Best coffee shop at Town, competitive prices and the chicken pesto sandwich is absolutely from another level, Andres will help you kindly he spikes spanish."
Cafe La Tazita,The staff is super friendly! The food was great for a quick breakfast. Coffee is good 👍 There are seats on the top floor too.
Cafe La Tazita,The woman making the drinks was extremely friendly and helpful.  We had two cappuccinos and shared the breakfast burrito special.  We are from San Diego and the breakfast burrito was very good in comparison.  We say in the second level and it had a great view of what was going on outside.
Cafe La Tazita,"OMG!!! This hole in the wall is sooooo goooooood! Had a latte and the Valencia scramble, along with a piece of blueberry crumb cake. Everything was delicious! Thank you!!!!"
Cafe La Tazita,Cappuccino was pretty bad. The espresso tasted awful. Service was not bad necessarily but not good - not friendly which I wouldn’t care about normally if the drink was good.
Cafe La Tazita,Hi Lin. We are so sorry about your experience. If you don’t mind email me at info@cafelatazita.com so I can correct this for you. Thank you
Cafe La Tazita,I ate so fast I didn’t take a photo!! Delicious scramble eggs sandwiches! Great coffee and awesome quick service
Cafe La Tazita,Hi Sergio We truly appreciate the 5 star review. We are glad you enjoyed everything. We hope to see you again soon. Thank you 
Cafe La Tazita,"Food was very good ,very tasty and  good as well,unfortunately the cashier is so rude ,not friendly at all. Every time we ask her anything she look at us like we were such a bother. Staff in any cafes should be nice and welcoming, but that is not the case here."
Cafe La Tazita,The location is good. The service is great. I got the over medium eggs with latte. The drink and the eggs tasted great. The place certainly needs some renovation and seems a bit run down . Will probably come again.
Cafe La Tazita,Very cozy vibes and the staff were very helpful and sweet! Hot chocolate and cappuccino were yum! We went twice for breakfast to Cafe La Tazita!
Cafe La Tazita,"Came to San Francisco for the week & loved La Tazita! The coffee is amazing & so is their food, definitely give it a try if you’re in the area"
Cafe La Tazita,Delicious no-nonsense breakfast. I ate too much.
Cafe La Tazita,I stayed with my family in San Fran for a few days and once we found this place we fell in love. The place itself is super cute with food that cooked homemade and is super super good. The service was excellent and the two owners were such lovely people. The food is excellent and the portions are great and I highly recommend going there. The prices is even are good and definitely worth it for the tasty food and wonderful environment.
Cafe La Tazita,"Nice staff, quickly delivered food. My avocado cream bagel was great"
Cafe La Tazita,Very nice coffee and chicken pesto sandwich!!! And service was lovely!!! Really friendly chaps. Would recommend.
Cafe La Tazita,A great little quick and good cafe. It looks unassuming from the outside but they have a wide variety of food and from what I had it was very good. Worth a stop if you're in the area.
Cafe La Tazita,Fast and friendly! Food was good we order napa scramble. Next time I’m going to order lomo saltado sandwich.  The seating area is a little tricky but it works.
Cafe La Tazita,Decent moderately priced breakfast for any tourist on the go. Limited seating.
Cafe La Tazita,"We struggled to find a great coffee spot that was cozy and delicious. It was next door to our hotel the whole time! A+ breakfast, friendly service, great atmosphere for someone who prefers a hometown coffeeshop vibe!"
Cafe La Tazita,"The food is fine, but it’s nothing special. I paid nearly $10 for eggs and black beans. Must have been some impressive eggs. The diner is small. The staff was not overly friendly. I also wouldn’t call this place quick. It took 15 minutes to get my food. There are better places to get breakfast in this area of San Francisco."
Cafe La Tazita,"Love this wonderful, intimate Cuban restaurant! The huevos rancheros were incredible!"
Cafe La Tazita,Lovely nice cafe with reasonable priced breakfast. Staff are friendly & service swift
Cafe La Tazita,"I went here for breakfast and it was an ok place. The staff was very friendly even though it was quite full. The food lacked a bit of time in general. Way overpriced but you will probably  not get any scrambled eggs below $9 in the vicinity. Still... Two scrambled eggs (as seen in the pictures) and two orange juices was $30. It was very expensive and flavorless.  The place was very very small for the demand it had. The second floor was very nice for a quick breakfast and everything was clean but we were lucky to get a spot.  We went there because of the reviews, but I guess it's a bit over-estimated. I'd go to another place for breakfast or brunch.  Price 2/5 Service 5/5 Place 3/5 Food 2/5"
Cafe La Tazita,Best located just near the hotel i stayed. Good food and coffee
Cafe La Tazita,"I expected a fine breakfast, but the lady today at 9:30am (10/19/2021) was very rude and was not able to take our order as we wished. Never ever this place despite taste cakes we ate here, unfortunately.. and this is how I got my cold milk on top of 2 espressos and 3 cakes 😂 Staff in any cafes should be nice and welcoming, I believe …"
Cafe La Tazita,"The pastries were so delicious & the coffee just great! Plus enjoyable conversation with the barista - it's really a small, but very nice place right in the centre !"
Cafe La Tazita,I had the Valencia scramble as a plate. House made chorizo was absolutely amazing!
Cafe La Tazita,Thank you to Cafe La Tazita and the Union Square Business Improvement District for donating delicious sandwiches to our department in SFGH. The turkey club sandwich I received was delicious. A+
Cafe La Tazita,Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
Cafe La Tazita,Excellent quality. I ordered the La Taza Fruit plate and it was worth every penny. The fruit was perfectly ripe and the fruit to yogurt ratio was on point 👌🏻 …
Cafe La Tazita,"I’ve been coming here for years from time to time for breakfast and I’ve never been disappointed. Always fresh and tasty food, very good coffee and juice, friendly staff and latin music. The perfect combination for a good start into a new day."
Cafe La Tazita,Americano taste delicious. The sandwich is unforgettable. Carving it now. Staff is friendly. A little over priced.
Cafe La Tazita,"This cafe is so good! The staff was super friendly, the food so delicious and the coffee too! Hablan español también :) We got the Thai salad 😋, the Valencia scramble sándwich a cortado and an iced mocha with chocolate abuelita. Everything was prepared to perfection! Highly recommend."
Cafe La Tazita,The best breakfast I had in SF.
Cafe La Tazita,"I been going to la Tazita now and before it was called La taza with different owner same employees though. Every time I came it was a wonderful experience, very friendly, very kind, caring and their food is amazing as well as their coffee/latte. My favorite plate is La Taza Salad always been my favorite and their coffee accompanied by egg bagel before work. Their customer service is beyond phenomenal and their environment is amazing."
Cafe La Tazita,"Good food in a cozy location.  Friendly staff. Convenient to Union Square shops and  hotels. Dining area is small, but carry out is available.  I really liked the El Cubano sandwich."
Cafe La Tazita,"Nice cafe,good breakfast 😊"
Cafe La Tazita,"This cafe has character! The Brentwood is the best breakfast burrito I’ve ever had. If I were local I’d be here all the time. Cozy and unassuming. Also, delicious fresh squeezed orange juice."
Cafe La Tazita,"GREAT STAFF. Delicious lattes made with a smile. Choose your scramble your style - burrito, plate, sandwich. Sides of black beans and potatoes Fresh, simple not boring and made with care. Daily breakfast for 6 days!"
Cafe La Tazita,Cute breakfast spot with great food and baked goods
Cafe La Tazita,Thanks so much for the 5 star review Andy! It really means a lot.  Thank you 
Cafe La Tazita,"Great food, quick service"
Cafe La Tazita,Came in for quick brunch. Huevos rancheros didn't disappoint. A little small but worth it. Good prices.
Cafe La Tazita,I got food poisoning after eating a sandwich from here. I pointed out what I thought was mold on the meat (after eating half) and the lady hurried up and took the sandwich back before I could snap a picture. Then asked me to leave. Not only was I given old meat but I was asked to leave because others started checking their food as well. Be careful eating here. The meat isn’t properly prepared or stored apparently.
Cafe La Tazita,"Best chicken sandwich I've ever had. We found it by accident on our last trip, now we make it a must stop for lunch. Great food and great people."
Cafe La Tazita,"Pretty good, but they could improve their toppings. The ones they have don't combine with a salmon sandwich.  I'd recommend avocado, rucula, and egg."
Cafe La Tazita,Good and affordable. Great coffee.
Cafe La Tazita,"Cute and cozy coffee shop, loved their flavors"
Cafe La Tazita,Coffee was great and the latte was excellent. Soy and almond milk options!
Cafe La Tazita,Beautiful little Cafe with perfect coffee and a delicious breakfast. Staff was quick and friendly. If you get the chance to stop by for food or a quick coffee you absolutely should

Cafe La Tazita,"excellent breakfast, nice people there, open at 8am Monday-Sat, open at 9am Sunday"
Cafe La Tazita,"Try this place!  I just enjoyed the chicken pesto sandwich, and it was probably the best chicken sandwich I have had in at least a year!  The ingredients are fresh, the flavors are amazing, and the people are friendly.  Definitely going to make this a regular go-to in the City for lunch!"
Cafe La Tazita,Thanks a lot
Cafe La Tazita,"Very cool place to grab breakfast, quick snack, coffee, desserts and more. Cool views of people passing by from the window seats. Friendly staff that are good at making suggestions. Very excellent food and beverages. You will want to stop by more than once."
Cafe La Tazita,"Came here for breakfast and there was no one else on a Saturday morning, should have been enough warning to go some where else. Entire breakfast was undercooked, egg yolks were cold, bacon was completely limp, and potato’s were crunchy in the middle from not being cooked. My partner had black beans that were lacking in flavor and tasted like they came from a can. Could have gotten a better quality meal at McDonald’s for half the price."
Cafe La Tazita,Freindly service and good breakfast. I ate here several times and good prices. The food was fresh and the cashier was very accommodating.
Cafe La Tazita,"The coffee is good but not amazing like 3/5. Staff was nice and speaks Spanish. Vegan options not available as far as I know. I recommend the cubano sandwich, it was juicy and rich, comes with side salad or potato chips. The salad was a mix of spring greens and tomato, I liked it. I don’t recommend the alfajor pastry they are ok. I do recommend the Russian wedding cookies."
Cafe La Tazita,Great food nice people 10 out of 10 delicious!!
Cafe La Tazita,The food is very plain I paid $16 for this

Cafe La Tazita,"The oatmeal was delicious, and the full espresso bar is awesome."
Cafe La Tazita,"I visited this place coz of reviews, unfortunately the food was not as great as mentioned in the reviews. Eggs were overcooked, toast was ok, potatoes were the only good thing I had there."
Cafe La Tazita,"I come to this place often and the food is excellent unfortunately the staff is very unfriendly. My oatmeal was luke warm and thought I was going to be shot for asking to have it heated more, unfortunately they put it in the microwave... 😒 …"
Cafe La Tazita,Great coffee and amazing staff. Thank you!
Cafe La Tazita,Food was good and service was good too.

Cafe La Tazita,delicious but not exceptionally delicious.
Cafe La Tazita,"Not the best atmosphere in a somewhat cramped location, but the food was great and for the best prices I've seen in the area.  Definitely reccomend it for a quick and tasty breakfast."
Cafe La Tazita,"Nice, small place with good breakfast and coffee. Also serves booze if you're interested in that. Good meal, moderately priced."
Cafe La Tazita,Amazing food for very reasonable price. Very tasty and so incredibly fast. Thank you!
Cafe La Tazita,"Nice place with good food, but a bit overpriced for what you get.  Sour cream tastes strange and is runny in a weird way."
Cafe La Tazita,A nice little cafe.
Cafe La Tazita,"This place is disgusting. My friend and I were on vacation and ended up here for Brunch. We both got the Golden Gate Scramble and both got sick after. It was way too salty, the smoke salmon takes spoiled like it has been sitting for a while. Coffee was nasty."
Cafe La Tazita,Good Californian breakfast
Cafe La Tazita,"Food was fine, good music. Mexican hot chocolate was awesome. Fair pricing. Would go again."
Cafe La Tazita,Great little place. Excellent coffee . My morning stop while staying in SF
Cafe La Tazita,"It's a shame they close to early. Delicious food and great fresh coffee! Good wifi, it's a decent place to study if you don't mind a little background noise!"
Cafe La Tazita,"Food was absolutely outstanding, fresh, great flavors and place.is low key. New favorite in SF for sure!"
Cafe La Tazita,Good food and prices... Super fast service. Cool Cuban vibe. Had the Post scramble in burrito form... More than enough food.
Cafe La Tazita,"Good food,  great coffee,  reasonable price. Potatoes would've required a bit more cooking but that's my only complaint."
Cafe La Tazita,"SO SO RUDE!! Disgusting service, the worst I’ve seen!!  It’s so busy yet people are lined up to be spoken to so rudely by the woman at the counter. It’s like she hates every customer that walks in her door. Realise lady they are paying for you to put food on your table!! It’s not hard to be nice"
Cafe La Tazita,"Breakfast was tasteless, I don’t understand the positive reviews, this is not even a nice place to hang out in & the service isn’t great"
Cafe La Tazita,Breakfast & lunch magnificent! Love all the fresh choices.
Cafe La Tazita,"Good service, good coffee, the food is meh and overpriced a little."
Cafe La Tazita,"Great coffee spot with Latin food, espresso drinks, wine and salsa music on the kitchen! I've been coming for two years now everytime I'm in town"
Cafe La Tazita,"Good food in a cozy setting, coffee is nice and strong just needed to be hotter. Limited menu for healthy choices"
Cafe La Tazita,We were in town visiting and the male waiter remembered us and how my daughter liked her oatmeal. That made each trip there special. Can't wait to visit again.
Cafe La Tazita,"This place has some fantastic sandwiches.  They're a little pricey, but not more than what you would typically find in this part of San Francisco.  I came here several times during my stay and I really enjoyed it.  The wait wasn't too long either, even when they were busy."
Cafe La Tazita,It wasn’t until I left that I understood the true magic of this cafe. The cook added a secret ingredient that would pleasantly remind me of the taste of my breakfast throughout my whole day!  The secret ingredient was food poisoning.
Cafe La Tazita,"Ended up here as it was  the only place with minimal line in the area around 10am on a Sunday. Dirty space, dishes smelled. Food quality less than average. Wouldn't suggest to anyone."
Cafe La Tazita,"Great cozy café, breakfast was delicious, service very friendly."
Cafe La Tazita,"Quaint space, food and coffee is great. The place gets smoky from the cooking so you don't want to sit to long as you smell lile food when you come out."

Cafe La Tazita,The staff were very nice! The food was wonderful and I loved the upstairs seating.

Cafe La Tazita,Amazing services and food. Love the coffee.
Cafe La Tazita,"I love this café. It reminds me of the great, independently owned cafes of yore, before the advent of chain coffee. Whenever I'm at the St. Francis or Hilton for work, I stop in here for Mexican Mocha. They have an extensive breakfast and lunch menu as well as coffee. I'm glad they're around."
Cafe La Tazita,been trying  to find good coffee in the area. ordered a latte and it is worth it. about as good as it gets near union square. has a few tables. bilingual staff
Cafe La Tazita,"A little hole in the wall, but the food was really good, home style and the pastries were to die for!"
Cafe La Tazita,Been going to this location for years and the staff and food are excellent!
Cafe La Tazita,"We had a bagel and a sandwich, the food was good. The service itself was ok, they don't really like to smile :)"
Cafe La Tazita,Nice place ! They built us special bagels a 4.00PM :) very tasty and friendly service.
Cafe La Tazita,"Such a cool place, very yummy and great service."
Cafe La Tazita,"Very average food and extremely overpriced. I payed $26 for an egg scramble with (not so great) orange juice and mashed potatoes on the side. Ridiculous.  Also the place looks much nicer in pictures. It looks more like a rundown diner than a cute cafe. If you want a cute cafe, there's a nice looking place next door."
Cafe La Tazita,Delicious food and best latte I've  had in years!
Cafe La Tazita,"Decent little cafe, the coffee is nothing to write home about but it'll do the job. Prices are reasonable."

Cafe La Tazita,"Excellent food and service, we will return for sure. Thanks!"
Cafe La Tazita,Food was great cute little place little bit over priced
Cafe La Tazita,"Pretty decent food - I had the chili verde scramble for breakfast. It was strange, but tasty. Really nothing special or amazing, but if I was in the area and hungry I would definetely eat here again, and happily."
Cafe La Tazita,Had a great breakfast for 4 days at this Café!
Cafe La Tazita,"Delicious taco plates delivered, via doordash, for Cinco de Mayo! The staff are so friendly and kind, the menu is full and we can’t wait to try something else!"
Cafe La Tazita,Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
Cafe La Tazita,"The food is really delicious. You can taste every single layer of your dish with a warm cup of coffee or tea, and just a simple drink of OJ."
Cafe La Tazita,Great food! I would eat there every day of I could.
Cafe La Tazita,"Simple in and out Coffee Expresso, Cappuccino, Mocha ... Lot better than you $5 coffee chain"
Cafe La Tazita,I ordered a grilled veggie burger. It was very filling and the portion was more than enough. The service was great and I loved the music playing.
Cafe La Tazita,"Great, clean and fast. The huevos rancheros and Valencia burrito were delicious!"
Cafe La Tazita,"Very nice spot to stop and get a quick coffee, bite to eat or just a snack. Met an old friend from the good old days on the Pacific Stock Exchange good to see you Todd"

Cafe La Tazita,A small hidden gem just off Union Square. Good food at reasonable prices. Try the Valencia scramble! Recommended.
Cafe La Tazita,Food was average. Customer service wasn't great. Coffee does the job.
Cafe La Tazita,"Best wrap I’ve ever had, quaint atmosphere in the middle of everything. Could use some power stations downstairs but did not detract."
Cafe La Tazita,"Food is always good, especially the steak salad."
Cafe La Tazita,"It is expensive, but considerIing the area... It was a little warm up at the balcony. There doesn't seem to be wifi. They are busy, but friendly. Sometimes people get turned off from the initial impression received from people different than they are. Sometimes people are more concerned with multitasking to serve orders well rather than cater to your feelings with that kind of brand of customer service. They close for a couple of hours at 3pm. Looked up and thought I was locked in! They came over and said, ""no problemo"" and let me out."
Cafe La Tazita,"Very friendly, great food, fun atmosphere. The coffee is excellent and I highly recommend the Cubano."
Cafe La Tazita,Tasty breakfasts at a reasonable price with a Mexican twist.
Cafe La Tazita,Relatively expensive but quick service and a great breakfast burrito!
Cafe La Tazita,Good selection of food and drinks.  Nice upstairs seating area.  Wifi and a few outlets.
Cafe La Tazita,Food is decent and it's opens early during the week
Cafe La Tazita,It was good a bit pricey for just eggs and potatoes
Cafe La Tazita,"not clean, service poor, food ok.    overpriced"
Cafe La Tazita,Very friendly staff and great menu variety. Super cute indoor dining too.
Cafe La Tazita,Thank you!
Cafe La Tazita,This is one of my favorite lil gems. The Churasco plate is one of the best lunch deals in the city.
Cafe La Tazita,Great american classic breakfast and cafe.
Cafe La Tazita,Good lunch sandwiches. Customer service is hit or miss.
Cafe La Tazita,"This place was awesome. Went to visit SF got off the cable car at the end of the line and looked for breakfast restaurant on maps, this place showed as the best reviewed and cheapest. The chai tea was bomb, and I think the sandwich was called El cubano was awesome. We don't have places like this in the desert . Coachella valley. Now I'm hungry."
Cafe La Tazita,Just took chai tea only. One of the best chai tea’s I had so far.
Cafe La Tazita,Cafe la tazita it's a great place to have breakfast and lunch your personal exelent thank you
Cafe La Tazita,Standard breakfast spot with good portions for the price.
Cafe La Tazita,Had the 2 2 2. The chorizo was great. Service was quick and friendly. The price was reasonable.  I'll definitely be back!
Cafe La Tazita,Great home in the wall cafe. The crossionwich was delish. Grab a spot in the front window; it's weird but great for people watching.
Cafe La Tazita,Quaint cafe. Only Vegetarian opton is like sandwiches which was pretty good. Not exactly cheap for a sandwich but what do you expect for the middle of SF.
Cafe La Tazita,"Mexican mocha and any of their scrambles. This place is awesome, settings tight, but definitely worth it."
Cafe La Tazita,The Huevos Ranchos is quite hot but very tasty. Good and fast service would eat again (maybe not the huevos Ranchos)
Cafe La Tazita,I got a cup homemade tomato basil soup along with an iced chai latte. The soup was spicy and flavorful and didn’t feel watered down or overly tomatoey. The iced chai was easily one of the best I’ve had in the city. I’ll be back again. Happy to have found this gem of a cafe.
Cafe La Tazita,Hands down best coffee Union Square.  Upstairs sitting area can get a little hot on warm days.
Cafe La Tazita,Nice breakfast in San Francisco’s shopping district.
Cafe La Tazita,Good!
Cafe La Tazita,A great and cozy section on Post St. Friendly service and a nice place to do some reading
Cafe La Tazita,"Acceptable price, went there to have a real latin breakfast with eggs, beans and pastries."
Cafe La Tazita,Found ourselves at this little cafe when we had only 30 mins for a quick bite on a Friday night prior to a show time of 8 PM at the Marine's Memorial theater.  Our order of chicken sandwich and coffee was served quickly and tasted great too.
Cafe La Tazita,Came in for the first time and ordered a latte and the tomato soup. The soup and latte were delicious and served quickly.  Biggest complaint is the serious lack of available electrical outlets.
Cafe La Tazita,I had coffee and a Napa Scramble burrito - I sometimes find egg burritos can be a bit bland so was pleased to see a tub of salsa included. Busy but service was pretty speedy and there are more tables upstairs. Overall a good option for no-nonsense breakfast or lunch (prices are reasonable for the area and it's slightly out-of-the-way from the Union Square crowds).
Cafe La Tazita,Good prices and best huevos rancheros I've had
Cafe La Tazita,The Classic Croissant breakfast sandwich was very good and coffee was good too.
Cafe La Tazita,Really good and affordable food
Cafe La Tazita,Great Mexican coffee and fruit /granola plate!
Cafe La Tazita,"For a coffee lover, the coffee beans used here is just commercial type. Don't put a lot of hope on the coffee here !"
Cafe La Tazita,Didn't get what I ordered and they were a little slow...
Cafe La Tazita,"Huvos Rancheros is good,  good spicy breakfast choice, fresh mind with mint tea. awesome!"
Cafe La Tazita,Such great food! Valencia Scramble is to die for. I love their pastries and they are always very friendly.
Cafe La Tazita,Great salads. Add sauteed chicken
Cafe La Tazita,"We had a deli sandwich and salad, it was AMAZING!"
Cafe La Tazita,Excellent food and service
Cafe La Tazita,Grace makes the BEST Caramel Frappe! It's loaded with 3 shots. Better than Starbucks!  The food is delicious and unique.  A bit pricey but it is in Union Square so you should expect the higher prices. The food is worth the extra few bucks. I heard they have a sister location in the Mission that is super good too!
Cafe La Tazita,Salmon sandwich is quite tasty. Breakfast is average and pretty charred.
Cafe La Tazita,"Very good huevos rancheros, good spicey but not too much.  Wife loved her Napa Scramble. Assortment of fresh baked goods (fantastic crumb cake) and good coffee."
Cafe La Tazita,I decide if I want to tip. You have to give me back my change first
Cafe La Tazita,"Ordered two bagels with cream cheese, but got a bagel cut in half instead. Also they intentionally missed items on our breakfast plate. Regular coffee was bland. It is a place that rips off tourists."
Cafe La Tazita,There was a thick black hair in my sandwich. Disgusting
Cafe La Tazita,Today's egg scramble on sourdough was fresh hot and good.
Cafe La Tazita,Good service and good food---
Cafe La Tazita,Lady at the counter had a really dismissive tone. Food was pretty bad.
Cafe La Tazita,The huevos rancheros was very nice
Cafe La Tazita,Great croissant sandwich. Delicious.
Cafe La Tazita,Very warm and friendly service with great food
Cafe La Tazita,"Great veggie burger, tomato basil soup"
Cafe La Tazita,"If this place doesn't wake you up for breakfast, you may be dead. From the moment you walk in and are greeted by lively Latin music until the last bite of a chorizo sandwich, Cafe La Taza maintains its commitment to spicing up the first meal of the day. The sandwich bread is thickly sliced and the pastries are plentiful. The coffee might be the only place where Cafe could improve- the iced coffee is fine but seemed pedestrian when compared to the excitement of the food and atmosphere."
Cafe La Tazita,Nice breakfast but expensive
Cafe La Tazita,"Good food, good location"
Cafe La Tazita,Food is legit. Must try the Nepalese meal and the chicken momos!
Cafe La Tazita,"Quick service, great price for the area."
Cafe La Tazita,Coffee was strong and flavorful. Golden gate scramble with fruit was delicious.
Cafe La Tazita,"Great spot for a quick breakfast. Order downstairs, find a table upstairs!"
