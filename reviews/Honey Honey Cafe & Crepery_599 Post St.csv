Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"My partner visited this place half a decade ago and recommended we come here now that we were back in the city. Glad we did.  You have to get here early to secure a table without a wait. Came 7am on the dot with no issues with securing a table. The coffee was strong and the breakfast burrito was just perfect. One of the best ways to start the day. My partner also gave her crepes rave reviews. All in all, worth a stop."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"One of the best Crepery in San Fran. They have this uniquely designed menu with a variety of desert crepes and savory crepes that's just captivating. You check out the menu, place your order, take your number, find a seat and they bring heaven to you. The food is fast, and yet amazingly delicious and they do give you a descent portion."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food was outstanding.. I had Philly cheese-steak.. was ok . . I think it would be better if they pour a cheese sauce over the crepe, it would take away some the dryness.  My wife had Miami Heat crepe, was outstanding."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast place! Food came out quickly and was at a reasonable price. You have to go up the counter and order and then find a table to wait at with a card. The line can get long and it seemed like they were lacking workers. The place is somewhere in between a cafe and a restaurant if that makes sense, the tables were mostly meant for pairs. It wasn't that small but they could have definitely fit more tables in or have few more tables for groups of 4, especially when they can get really busy. All in all, a great place for breakfast cravings."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I recently visited Honey Honey Crepe and Cafe and was thoroughly impressed by my experience. The cafe has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere, with ample seating and a relaxed vibe that makes it the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a meal.  As the name suggests, the crepes are the star of the show here, and they did not disappoint. I ordered the savory spinach and feta crepe and it was absolutely delicious - the crepe itself was perfectly cooked, and the filling was flavorful and well-seasoned. My dining partner ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella and banana, and it was equally fantastic.  In addition to the crepes, the cafe also offers a variety of other breakfast and lunch options, as well as a good selection of coffee and tea. The service was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable for the quality of the food.  Overall, I would highly recommend Honey Honey Crepe and Cafe to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast or lunch spot in San Francisco. The crepes are definitely the highlight, but the cafe as a whole is a gem that's well worth a visit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Ate here on 7.16.2023. Did not have a good experience. I poured water from the free water dispenser that had cucumber slices and it tasted weird and was lukewarm. I asked for Pepsi and they handed me a very dirty can that was stained with what I think was soda. The food was ok, not bad, serviceable. We saw people in the kitchen without gloves.  Overall, just felt dirty being here."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery has a variety of breakfast options. It’s a very busy cafe and expect between 20-30 mins of waiting time over the weekends to get a spot. The service was okay and the food quality was good. Lastly the prices were very fair and reasonable.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place was delicious we got the SBK with hot chocolate and the 2-2-2 (we replaced pancakes with French toast) and got the chai tea. Waited about 10-15 mins for our food with about 5 other tables in front of us at opening. Would highly suggest getting there early to avoid crowds and wait time.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,We were looking for a breakfast spot with a lot of options. Honey Honey Cafe had so many great options. Our breakfast came fast and was delicious. We will definitely be back.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Honey Honey is a small, homey feeling cafe with lots of different breakfast and lunch choices from omelettes and crepes to burgers. The location and staff are kind and accommodating and food comes out really quickly. Would definitely recommend trying some of the items off of the specials menu and the specialty drinks are interesting as well. I do wish that the flavors or character of the place popped a little more in the dishes, but regardless the experience and food was pretty good. Would definitely visit again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Self service cafe. A bit crammed since people have to queue to order and not much space between tables. My lemon crepe was quite disappointing. But at least they use proper coffee mug.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Sorry had to take pic on pic of meal. Love the organization of this busy place. Went for breakfast and it was great! No fuss especially on a Sunday morning with brunch lines.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"thanks you for stopping by honey honey we glad that everything was good , we hope seeing you again 'thanks"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Nice selection of dishes. Seating is rather close between tables. Line up and order at counter. They give you a number for your table. Eggs Benedict was ok. My wife liked the Crab Cakes Florentine. Hot chai was too sweet for me.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I’m sorry but I need to tell the truth… latte tastes like cigarettes ash water… the crepe is thick n some of the mixture is not fully cooked… fruits inside are okay, but hey, this restaurant is selling crepes but the crepes are not even well cooked… I feel sorry.  Cream is nice tho."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We ordered at counter, got a number for number, then picked a table. food was buses out to our table directly. We went at 8 in the morning. Service was fast. We love the large variety choices for breakfast. Food was good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing cafe , friendly staff go early otherwise you may have to queue.  Good menu choice"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"thanks you for stopping by honey honey we glad that everything was good , we hope seeing you again 'thanks"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It seems based on past reviews they’ve really cleaned up their act. The service was good (for counter service) and the staff was fast and efficient at cleaning upnot tables. The bathroom was clean! The wait wasn’t bad even though it was packed, it is VERY noisy, just a heads up. I think they need to pare down their menu, I got the #4 bagel and it just wasn’t good. certainly not worth the money. But other people’s plates looked really good, the crepes and egg dishes especially."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Short walk from Courtyard Union Square on Christmas morning. Worth the wait in line inside. We each had a cheese blintz and it was really delicious, creamy, sweet but not too sweet. Left us satisfied but not stuffed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,A nice place were have breakfast They have a wide selection both salad and sweet. We tried strawberry&banana crepes and pancakes.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The croissant was perfect! Big portion! Delicious OJ!!! And the loved that they had different milk substitutes. I’ll be back for sure!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"nice food, the crepe are good the inside is not the best but it’s good for a breakfast / brunch !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,A casual restaurant where you order your food at the counter and pick your own table where they will bring out your food to you. I ordered pancakes that came with a side of strawberries and sprinkled with powder sugar. Portions are huge. Pancakes were very thick  and yummy. I also ordered a side of bacon....very thick and yummy. The only thing I didn't like about here I had to ask for another container of syrup for my three fluffy pancakes.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast/brunch place! They have crêpes, pancakes, bagels, sandwiches, soups, and salads. Also very friendly attendance."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place has amazing food. I got the salmon scramble and it had a lot of smoked salmon with the eggs. The breakfast potatoes were amazing. So flavorful. Would def recommend to others.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Steer clear until this place gets itself together. A deep cleaning, menu abbreviation, and staff retraining would be steps in the right direction.  The good: portions were appropriate for the prices and the OJ was freshly squeezed.  The rest: burnt bacon (to their credit they replaced it asap; while appropriately cooked, it wasn’t great), sticky tables and walls flecked with old food, lackluster service, food that tasted like it fell right off the Sysco truck, and suspect hygiene practices.  Not sure how this place has such a good rating, because our experience was beyond disappointing. The sagging awning should have been a sign for us to turn back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We came here for the majority of our breakfasts. Prices are slightly cheaper than most other cafes and portions are filling. Line can be long BUT it moves very quickly, and don’t worry about sitting to find a table, by the time you order something will open up.  If your not sure what to order, try the Eggs Benedict! Eggs Benedict were our favorite!  The potatoes were good, nothing out of the ordinary. The French toast was very sweet. Belgium waffle was loaded with bananas, strawberries and a ton of whipped cream. Husband loved their latte and house coffee. They have different syrups in the back to flavor your latte if you desire. Not sure if the cook just had an off day when we ordered the post street omelette but the veggies weren’t fully cooked and the omelette wasn’t sealed shut."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A nice place to try different kinds of crepes. I tried the savory Mediterranean crepe. Would have liked to have had a sauce of some sort with the crepe. The baklava sweet crepe was very delicious. Both were quite large, enough to fill and share as well. Great service and atmosphere."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Original savory crepe is great and worth a try. Overall, It’s a nice place for breakfast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious pecan and lemon pancakes! 🥞 This cafe has excellent options for veggies, including a wide range of egg dishes, crepes, bagels and traditional brekkies. We came here on a Sunday morning and the queue was long but did move quickly enough. Staff are super kind and helpful and the food is high quality and reasonably priced. Also in a lovely area of SF near Union Square so it's nice and central. Highly recommended!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Tasty tasty! Pancakes were hot and fluffy, the eggs benedict were packed with flavor and paired well with the potatoes. The hot chocolate was SO GOOD and they served it in a fancy glass mug 😆 I felt incredibly special. If you're looking for a nice brunch spot in the Tenderloin that's spacious and accessible to the everyday person, I highly recommend it!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This was a random Yelp find for us. Highly rated over there so we made the trek in right after arriving in the city. Did not disappoint. There was a bit of a wait (we were in line about 20 mins) but they seemed pretty organized on getting people in to order, getting them sat, and getting empty tables cleared. After ordering, it was another short wait (about 10 mins) for the food to arrive - but WELL worth it. We ordered individually but did share and EVERYTHING was delicious. We also didn't feel rushed to leave, and sat enjoying some coffee for an extra 20 mins after we finished to plan the day. Almost returned for breakfast the next day, it was that good. Highly recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is amazing, they serve quality food and have great collection of items. First, we tried their cappuccino, mimosa and coffee everything bagel. The cappuccino tasted good, mimosa was excellent and the toasted bagel with butter went so well with the cappuccino. Next, we ordered Acapulco and pesto crepe, both tasted extremely well with great flavors, the potatoes given along side were a bit crispy and tasted nice and fresh. If you are in the city, I recommend visiting this place. Last, their staff is extremely kind and friendly, with the music playing, the indoor environment is quite lively!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Salmon Benedict and Nutella Strawberry crêpe was delicious. Also enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place has been one of my favorite breakfast and brunch restaurants for a while, the food is great. Everything on the menu is elite, can't go wrong with anything you pick. The staff is very nice and they go beyond! I must say that the Sunrise Burrito 🌯 is one of my favorites! Love this restaurant! 10+ 👍🏽👍🏽 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Reeeeally enjoyed the food here!! There can be a bit of a queue but it's worth it, especially in weekends :) The menu mainly includes sandwiches, crepes and waffles.. I honestly wanted to try everything! I ended up choosing a Pesto crepe which was delicious! The plate really fills you in and the prices are still humans, considering the cost of any restaurant in San Francisco! Highly recommended If you are in the area!! :)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Honey Honey is a fantastic breakfast/lunch option in downtown San Francisco. The offer pancakes, crepes, breakfast sandwiches, bagels and more. Everything is freshly made and delicious. They tend to be very busy and have a line out the door but it moves quickly. Check them out!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Was pretty underwhelmed with this experience... Suggested restaurant did not deliver (4 stars yelp). You have to order your food after standing in line rather than being seated and having a waiter, and this was ultimately this restaurant's demise.  I had to go up to ask for specific things no less than four times because we did not have a designated waiter as they did not anticipate salt and pepper, jelly for toast, etc.  Also the food was very underwhelming... the omelet was eggs cooked separately, and then cold ham and tomatoes stuffed inside rather than cooked within the eggs.  Very similar to Waffle House,.. do not recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I feel pretty fortunate to visit places that turn out to be a 4 or 5. However, this was definitely a 3 star experience. Overall, the food was alright, but not the best.  I wouldn’t NOT get the breakfast crepe again. The crepe was more like a tortilla. It was a bit tough to cut into which should not be the case. Definitely was more like a thin flour tortilla. The ham and veggies in the breakfast crepe were hot but had no change in flavor or texture like you’d get if something was properly cooked for flavor.  The 2, 2 and 2: eggs, a meat and two pancakes was also just alright. The pancakes were good but one of the pancakes was comically small. Felt like a rip off.  Barely worth the 10 minute line and then 20 minute wait.  It was busy when I arrived. It’s a order then seat establishment. I didn’t mind waiting in line for 10 minutes to place my to-go order since I could have easily ordered online. The staff was nice but I was shoulder checked by an employee as he rushed by. No big deal for me, but if I was elderly or had trouble standing I would have been knocked over.  Overall, slightly better than a Denny’s and more expensive. More casual, less class and cheaper than the brunch places around here like Mymy and Lapisara Eatery.  When I came home, plated the food and then brought it to my girlfriend in bed she asked me if I went to a Denny’s… 🥲  Has a large open interior with outdoor seating.  Eating in would probably lead to a better experience."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great spot! A bit busy- food comes in generous portions and delicious. Dulce de leche crepe was amazing! The north beach crepe had lots of chicken. Family friendly too, the kids liked seeing the fresh orange juice machine."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Place was obviously popular. Line was out the door for brunch. Waited about 30 minutes to order. Staff were friendly, helpful, and worked quickly to get people served. Food was good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,What a place! It’s so Homely with various options to try. I love that the menu is extensive and plenty of options. The cashier/ person at the register was so easy going and line moves quick. She suggested couple dishes for vegetarians and it was so worth it. They have good portions and the place in general is lively. I would say just stop by if you are hungry for delicious food in affordable price in San Francisco.  Some other observations - their restrooms were clean - the get the fresh orange juice in-front if your eyes and unlike other places where they give you boxed - mimosa hit the spot so better order it. Don’t second guess. - if you have time - do study their menu or just go with their recommendations - table layout is planned so that everyone can be distanced
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent food, wait staff were all friendly and expedient!  Atmosphere got 3 stars because for breakfast time, it was BUSY.  Nothing against the restaurant, just not a quiet breakfast like we were looking for."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food is great however the space is too small, the line to order crosses the whole restaurant between the tables. The order was ready within 3 minutes. A few mistakes with the order though. Overall the food is delicious but I don’t think I’m excited to come back. I haven’t had the chance to take pics because the waitress hurries everybody to leave the table free for the bunch of people waiting."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good spot for breakfast or brunch. They have an extensive menu of different items you can order at reasonable prices. Service is fairly quick and the staff are friendly.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A real find on vacation. The line moves along with the most efficient server I've ever seen. She takes orders, makes coffee drinks, and stays friendly and helpful. Our food was delicious. Enjoyed a savory crepe for breakfast and an omelet. We dined in and had our order quickly. Fun stop! Update: we liked it so much, we went back. Same awesome service. Same great food. Tried the blintz crepe which was awesome! Might squeeze in another trip before we head home!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I was disappointed in the food. Great presentation but lacking in flavor.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"First time visiting Honey Honey Cafe and Crepery with my colleagues on Friday for lunch and it was a good experience. We heard good things about Honey Honey, one being that they are good for large groups (6 or more guests). First, let me start with the positive! I really like the outside aesthetic of the business. The wooden happy face carved into the pole that divides the entrance under the awning is very appealing. Once you walk inside, you notice several large colorful chalkboards that detail the extensive menu. Now, in fairness, it’s very hard for ANY restaurant to do “everything well.” In honesty, I enjoyed the music (playlist) more than I did the meal. Now to my critical feedback, the food I ordered was okay. I ordered a Bacon Blue Cheeseburger and French fries. They did a good job on the burger, but the French fries left A LOT to be deserved. You can tell that they were frozen from a large bag and thrown into the deep fry. They were bland and lacked seasoning. Now, im always willing to give any business a second chance, so I look forward to trying one of their breakfast options next visit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing food, loved the fresh squeezed orange juice! Lemon crepes and breakfast crepes were delicious as well. Helpful and friendly staff. Music was a little loud but overall experience was fabulous ."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Not great for large groups.  Nice people, good food, food came out quick."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was good, but first I got the wrong one served. The location is ok."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Unbelievable breakfast. Had the salmon benedict. Cannot lose here. Short trip to SF, stayed nearby. Ate here both mornings."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice place, gets quite busy in the morning. You have to order at the counter and the food gets served to you. Nice staff. I love American pancakes, but they were a bit tasteless without the syrup. Luckily whip cream was also available. The fruit was also really fresh."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Variety of items on the menu for breakfast. Of you are by union square you should definitely go check this out. Lines are long but the staff are very efficient at guiding and taking orders. My son had the crepes and I had the post omelette.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious banana Nutella crepes. This place was extremely busy so you know it’s really good food.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We had a long wait as the line was out the door, but the manager was making sure there was a table set aside for each group, so we had a place to sit after we ordered. The food came quickly, was delicious, and reasonably priced for SF. Great customer service and a huge menu."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Crepes were delicious, the crab cake crepe was one where you did not have to look for the crab cake. There was a mistake made when picking up my order but the service recovery was fast and top notch. Going there for more tomorrow morning."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We visit every time we come to San Francisco.   Love the vibe,  the food... everything is wonderful"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good fast service! Like a crepevine! Had a post street omelette
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We went Here to experience a unheathly breakfast and we were Not disappointed. The Menu offers many sugary and savory choices (Crepes, eges, Pancakes, Sandwiches, ...) Portions were big but so were the price tags (~10-16$ per Crepes). The Restaurant is more of a one time experience, if you Happen to be in the neighbourhood. 2 Tips: - During our stay, two Independent customers send Back the french Toast ... - make Sure to come by before 9:30am or bei prepared for Long waiting Lines."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"In town for a conference staying at the Hilton and found this gem day one. My co-workers and I ate here EVERY MORNING. Crepes, pancakes, burritos are all large and fresh. Thick cut bacon, well crisped potatoes, and a very friendly staff make this a complete package for SF breakfast. Even during a rush, the front counter staff was cool, calm, and fast. Food came out hot and we left ready for the day."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice little gem. Great coffee, food and staff. Enough food to set you up before exploring San Francisco"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was great! However if it gets busy it's not comfortable to sit in the place because they have customers wait to order between the tables in the morning. And coffee was really chalky not the most amazing!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Incredible breakfast and brunch joint. They also do lunch. Our table had the salmon eggs with potatoes and toast, as well as the crab cake Florentine. Both were so good that we came back a second time during our stay in San Francisco. It’s a busy place. Crowds come in waves. The food is well worth the wait."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Nice spot for breakfast. Lots of different things to try!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was really good ! Tasty and really fresh. We gave to this restaurant 4/5 because this restaurant little bit expensive. Our table was small and were full of noises from the kitchen. One more thing that disappointed is that: we ordered ""Greek salad"" and we got only lettuce with three pieces of cucumbers and little bit of other pieces of vegetables . The restroom was not clean. The bottom line, this is good breakfast and an expensive meal."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I really wanted to love this place, especially after waiting 30+ minutes in line to get a table, but it was really just ""okay"".  We got the chorizo plate and the strawberry and nutella crepes - the crepes were good but nothing spectacular. The chorizo plate and potatoes were delicious! The orange juice was freshly squeezed which I appreciated (although my boyfriend thought it was a bit sour haha).  Overall, it was an okay experience. Would I wait in a line again to get into this restaurant? Probably not...but it was a good experience overall."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The cappuccino was humongous, simply too much. And the milk foam was too fluffy and would float on (as opposed to mix with) the mediocre and weak coffee.  Also my salmon Benedict left much to be desired, tasting  generally bland and with the poached eggs being almost hard boiled.  On the positive side, the orange juice was freshly made and enjoyable.  Overall, I personally think the food is not worth the wait and it's unlikely I will be going back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Absolutely amazing breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito, one of the best I’ve ever had. Chorizo and egg were seasoned excellently and the cheese was (for the most part) pleasantly melted. Beans weren’t dry and the salsa brought a great freshness to the dish. Alongside it, I had the orange juice. Trust me ; for a second just close your eyes about the price. It is the best orange juice I’ve personally had. Not even compared to store bought, but even to other freshly pressed orange juices, it was 10/10. Also tried the pancakes, nothing crazy but very fluffy, still very nice. Had a taste of the crab cakes, personally not a fan of seafood in general, but they were right on the money. Overall, great experience. Definitely recommend if you’re in the area !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Had a delicious breakfast crêpe with fried potatoes. It was a very good combination. There are crispy bits of bacon with the potatoes. Yummy hot cider as well. Especially enjoyed the selection of hot sauce. Service is fast and friendly, prices are reasonable. #localguides"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast. Crepes are fantastic and the omelettes were just as good! The honey cake. Ha... What can I say there? The honey cake was one of the best I've ever had. Good mochas, good coffee, good service. I can definitely recommend Honey Honey. You won't be disappointed!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Honey Honey is a fantastic restaurant and a perfect spot for brunch. I really enjoyed my Eggplant crepe. The staff are fast and kind. Give this place a try if you’re in the area
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Chorizo omelette was very good. Breakfast burrito was decent. Large portions, good food and friendly and efficient staff. The queue is usually quite long (out to the door), but moves quite quick. I was there twice and both times spent around 15 minutes in line when it started at the entrance. They will get you a table when you order food."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"long queue but great food. value for money. we ordered the two & two, New Orleans crepe and Crabcake Florentine. they all taste good. Would definitely come back again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place is terrific! Nutella and banana crepe was to die for! And the tofu scramble for the vegetarian in the group certainly did not disappoint! Flavors were fresh and delicious! Can't wait to go back and try more menu items!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Here in San Francisco with my dad on vacation and we went here for breakfast. The strawberry banana pancakes with pecans added  are amazing! This place was so good!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We recently spent a week in SF, and ended up eating here most mornings!  Pretty much everything here is great, we usually had a savoury plate & a shared dessert plate (the waffles!!!!!), ensuring we had plenty of calories for a long day of tourist-ing.  As a pro-tip, go straight to the counter and order, then you'll be given a table number, THEN you can go and sit at your table. It confuses quite a few newcomers!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Sunday, 9:30am - loong line, but according to the majority, its so worth it! It took us 1h30min to get a table to eat and... disappointment 😞 Definitely not worth the wait: the food was ok, just ok. Nothing really wrong with it, but nothing yummy or tasty either: both the North Beach crepe and eggs Florentine had a plain taste. Would not really go back,unless maybe to try their desserts."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Way overpriced. Paid $27 for a mediocre waffle and french toast. The food looks good and the environment is family friendly
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,3 fluffy pancakes with fresh banana and strawberries was good. We had a side of whipped cream with it that really sealed the deal on them. The ham and cheddar breakfast crepe was excellent.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great little diner/cafe.  Indoor seating is now allowed.  They have a very expansive menu that includes sandwiches, crepes, and a variety of breakfast options.  I had the Mediterranean crepe and my husband had the breakfast crepe.  My crepe was filled w/feta cheese, avocado, artichokes, tomato, and onion - delicious.  It also included a super fresh salad. Everyone was friendly.  We enjoyed our brunch here and would return."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This was a very popular spot, but the line moved quickly. The menu was massive! We had the pesto crepe and the fresh crab cake eggs benedict. Both did not disappoint. Friendly staff and free flavoured water. The portion sizes were very generous."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The best and most delicious breakfast cafe. There is so much choice that it is difficult to decide. Everything is delicious. It's always busy and there's a lot of people waiting, but the staff is well organized and it goes fast. We have been here several times and can recommend it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good options for food and drinks. The metod is ordering from the cashier, she also makes the drinks. You take your drinks to the table on your own (there are glass and water tanks near the cashier if you want water). The waiters are only there to bring you the food and cleaning the table - and they are not very eager to do anything else. It can be a 15 min wait before ordering."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"First time here and my wife loved it. She loves coffee but she decided to have their vanilla latte (regular on their menu but you can add syrups). She also order their Blintz crepé and she also recommends it. It is on the sweet side but really good, the cottage cheese balances it. I had their potatoes and chorizo as sides. Their chorizo is really good, highly recommend having it. As my wife said after taking a bite, “Mexican descendant approved.”"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A good breakfast spot with good food but it was not anything ""special"". Worth having good breakfast but not a place I would cross town for. I had the breakfast burrito which was a good choice as the chorizo was tasty. Just the right amount of spice and the texture of the burrito with beans made it a great choice. Mine looked no we than some of the reviews I had seen so I was happy. Service was efficient and friendly, menu was fairly wide ranging. My wife has French toast and enjoyed it as well. Meals were filling."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It’s just. So. good. Not even a breakfast person and this place is a must. -Fresh squeezed OJ is perfectly tart, refreshing, and sweet. -Breakfast crepe is cheesy with hearty filing and light & doughy crepe. I was frankly skeptical about a savory crepe. When I think crepe I think Nutella & fruit. Welp, I’ll never look at a crepe the same way again.  My mind was blown. Potatoes are perfectly cooked with a unique hint of miso. Unreal. -French toast on thick fresh bread. Must dip in the side of sweet dream."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Although the name of the restaurant is crepes, they actually have a huge menu including breakfast items like pancakes and sausages,  burgers and fries, soup and sandwiches,  and more. They serve both sweet and savory crepes. All their food is fabulous. Go in, order and pay at the counter, take the number given and fine a seat. The staff brings the food to the table. Note, this restaurant is in the theater district so there is very limited street parking. Best option is to park in a Pau garage."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, Great Service . We did go on rush hour but totally worth it. I’m so happy with the selections of food there was . We walked over there which took us about 15 min from where we were staying at Market St. The house coffee was amazing, our food came out 10-15 minutes after we sat down, people working there are super nice even though it was crowded and that’s what mattered !!!. Totally recommending this place, come and eat if you are in San Fran."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Probably one of the best Nutella Crepes I’ve ever had! Fresh squeezed orange juice that’s a must and good food to company along with a black coffee first thing on a Sunday morning.  This place is located on a very busy cross street and the line can wrap around so expect at least an hour wait but well worth it.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"My hotel recommended this cafe. What a great, unique local hang. They had a large menu with multiple selections, from savory and dessert crepes to healthy egg white and salmon options. A full coffee menu also helps you wake up quickly! Will definitely be back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent quality food! The wait time was around 30 minutes to be seated, but well worth it considering the taste and freshness of the food. Highly recommend the Mediterranean crepe. Potatoes- well done - were fantastic and the artichoke filled crepe was delicious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was outstanding. It was a great experience.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"If you like crepes and pan cakes, this place will be on your list of favorites. Crepes are tasty, the orange juice is freshly pressed, and the coffee is not a watery brew."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast, great value, could eat breakfast dinner and lunch here and never get bored.  Busy but quick friendly service"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I really can recommend to go an eat there. The food is very delicious and the prices are very fair for what you get. Coffee is all you can drink.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Decent crepes for a not too expensive, but also certainly not cheap price. Other times weren't as good but the crepes definitely hit the spot and did well for a quick breakfast with little queues near union square"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very good breakfast place or to grab a quick bite. There can be long lines, but they move people quickly. Our food was well prepared and tasty, definitely above your average breakfast joint. Somewhat bland interior."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"What an outstanding little hole in the wall cafe. Was able to super customize my eggs Benedict order just the way I like it. Coffee is machine made, not great. The place is a little run-down, but that's part of it's charm. Food was good! Price was fantastic, felt like I got a killer deal on some killer food. Service was quick and friendly, cashier was super funny, and waiter was very kind. Overall a great little spot."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I was also surprised by the extensive number of good reviews. This place is mediocre. Prices are around 10-15 an item. We ordered the salsa crepe and the blintzes. Both were kind of bland. Very odd. Needed lots of cholula to liven it up.  Potatoes were alright but had too much rosemary. The crepe also has some avocado that had already gone black. There’s better out there.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great service! Ordered their French toast, which was amazing! Also ordered there chorizo omlette which we didn't like, but they gladly changed it out for us no problem. Definitely would go back for brunch!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was alright. My egg was not poached and was completely cooked. The  rancheros was a under seasoned. The crepe was a bit dry and I wish they would of put the cream on the inside to sweeten the stuff a bit
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very cute and fun breakfast spot with tons of options on the menu.  Very shareable.  Great service.  Bustling, lively place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Absolutely love this place, SBK is my favorite. However they have a spiced apple cider that’s simply delightful. You get your choice of ice cream or whipped cream, my chocolate fans went with the ice cream, probably necessary since they don’t hold back on the Nutella. They do serve other food as well. We just had a taste for a little something light and tasty."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very tasty, with a lot of options for everyone."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Line was out the door, from when I got there...until I left. Lots of choices. I had the croissant sandwich. Pretty good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Read this: Food: it is delicious, you need to come here. Vegetarian options too. We tried; -huevos rancheros 5 🌟 ( -Crossaint sandwich 5 🌟 -Omelette Acapulco 4 🌟 -Creepe pesto 5 🌟  Service: fast and long lines. Arrive early. 4 🌟  Clean: it's clean. 5 🌟"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,One of my favorite places for breakfast anywhere. Crepes are always amazing and the service fantastic
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Big menu, and pretty affordable. Order at the counter and they will serve you your food. I didn’t get an option for a side with my sandwich. I got a California sandwich and an almond cookie for around $12. Decent service and decent atmosphere. If I lived closer it would be a place to go when I couldn’t decide."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I didn't think breakfast could taste that good. Highly recommend huevos rancheros. Peanut butter crepe was also awesome! Lined moved fast, 45 min from out the door to food served."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Honestly an average brunch. Nothing too special..potatoes were a bit burnt but uts just your average diner style spot
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fantastic food, extremely fast service. This place was pretty busy but our food came out very quickly. The crepes are great."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"thanks you for stopping by honey honey we glad that everything was good , we hope seeing you again 'thanks"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"After few years I came back to San Francisco and went to have a breakfast at Honey Honey. I was very pleased to come back as I was the first time I visited. It is delicious, this time I tried the Crab Benedict’s. The coffee is really good as well. Highly recommended and kudos to owners for maintaining the quality of the food."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Qucik and friendly service. Fries were amazing and the orange juice was great. Had the Nutella crepe which was good. Also recommend the torino crepe (savory).
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was excellent and the staff was very pleasant. Don't order the breakfast burrito unless you are super hungry or are heading somewhere with a fridge you can store leftovers in though!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is awesome.  Great food seasoned just right.  Had a cappuccino, nutella banana crepe, a savory breakfast crepe and a side of chicken sausage.  All were tops!  No hesitation to recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent establishment, had the Florence with potatoes and it was delicious.  Add a pinch of salt to the potatoes and they were perfect.  No line during lunch was a nice change from other places nearby."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It’s a good place to eat with the hosts being very kind. It gets packed quickly, has WiFi and had the football game on. The food was great and so was the coffee. The reason I gave them a 4 star is because the utensils they gave were dirty especially for an expensive meal. I paid $21 for Mocha latte and Huevos Ranchores. I think that’s a bit much especially because the coffee was mediocre. I asked for a change of utensils and received another set of dirty ones. Then got up and grabbed a set myself to finally get a clean set."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I really enjoyed the food here. Unfortunately so do a lot of other people so when I went it was quite a wait in line to order food. If you have the time to kill the food is worth the wait.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Such an awesome place. I got the SBK crepe and a vanilla Italian soda with a side of fries. The whipped cream was delightful and I love the addition of strawberry sauce on top. The fries were fresh and crispy. Service was quick, I love the self-seating option. Would definitely visit again the next time I am in SF."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fast, yummy, well priced, friendly, good music. Food came out incredibly quick and everything tasted scrumptious. Definitely coming back!!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Amazing spot and worth the buck. Well organised for a very busy place with a line. But by the time you order you will have a table to dine for sure. Amazing food and great portion!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The sad thing is I crave the food here and I live hours away. The ambience is phenomenal with the Latin music in the background that I want to bring my mom here. The food is really good like the eggs with chorizo (chef kiss) and chocolate waffle and strawberry crepe. My only warning is for breakfast, don't order both the chocolate waffle and crepe cuz its a lot of sugar. The whipped cream was bomb tho and perfectly not too sweet."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Loved loved loved this place!!!! Super fast. Amazing food!!!!  We went back several times.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Didn't expect much and anything exceptional but all of them were pretty good. We had an omelette, belgian waffle and strawberry banana crepe+ nutella."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We went there for breakfast, the place was very dirty (it was only 10am) and we saw the guy who serves the food stuck his finger into a maple syrup cup and then serve it to a Client. The food was cold, potatoes burnt. Not worthy at all to spend your money there."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Cute little corner café. Had the baklava crepes which were good but maybe too many walnuts for my taste. No biggie, though. The freshly squeezed orange juice was absolutely amazing."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is a great joint. I've had many platters from here and never been dissaponted. The line can get long, easily. If there is one thing to suggest here, it's that they get more help up front. The person taking the orders seems to also make all the drinks and it slows down the line tremendously."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The breakfast crepe was very good, as well as the salsa crepe. The locals in San Francisco really like this place. Weekday mornings the lines are out the door. They offer, teas, coffee juices etc. The potatoes were too dry and overdone for me, but everything else was pretty good. The wait staff is a bit gruff, but with lines out the door, they are trying to move people. I will say that the restrooms we're immaculate."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious food with great services. Breakfast Specials are must-try. Eggs Benedict with Potatoes was my favorite. Whip cream on Iced mocha is little weird but makes it unique taste.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We got the Belgian waffle, chorizo scramble and breakfast crepe and all three dishes were great! Long line (out the door) that took about 30 min but once we placed our order, it was ready in 10 min"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food and friendly staff but wasn't worth the wait. I waited in line for 35 minutes and waited for my food for 25 minutes after I ordered. Had the food been amazing I would have been ok with that because I wasn't in a hurry. But the food was no better than average. The crepe selection was very large though so I'm sure there were a few items on the menu that I probably would have been better than what I got.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is popular and was busy when I visted. They have a large menu with many options. I had the Crab Cake Florentine and a mimosa. It was delicious and worth the wait. I enjoyed the local feel of this place. I thought this place was pricey for brunch, but then again San Francisco is expensive."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!!! This place is absolutely amazing. Second time in SF, and second time eating at Honey Honey. From the staff being so efficient and quick and delicious food. Most amazing crepes in SF. Will definitely come back any chance I get!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"VERY BUSY, good food BUT you can find better if you have high standards or you care about the presentation of your food. They have lots of options and reasonable prices. Portions are fairly big. Their COFFEE is NOT GOOD/ they have fresh orange juice."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Extensive menu, reasonably priced, good coffee and not too long of a wait. We arrived at 8.30am and a line began to form after we had ordered."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A wide variety of breakfast type food and sandwiches. I can recommend the crepes, they were just the right thickness. Coffee was nice and it was well priced. It's a popular place however, so there was a queue by 8.30 on a Sunday morning, so it's not somewhere to go if you're in a rush."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Lovely family owned restaurant and beautiful people. Delicious breakfast Benedicts and pancakes of course 😊
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Set up is really cute, and there’s a wide variety of food. We went Saturday around 10:00, and it was crowded — so be prepared to wait or wake up earlier. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. Belgian Waffle was on point!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I'm an ""Eggs Benedict"" type of person, so I ordered the Benedict with ""Fresh Cab Cakes"". Honestly, I wasn't impressed. Something was off on the Poached Egg or the Sauce and the Crab cake was most definitely a lil off on the flavoring. The potatoes were tasty tho. Had coffee with my breakfast, sadly no one came to give us a refill. I'd go back if I'm too lazy to walk to Mama's (which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!)."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious breakfast selections, with large selection, including many reasonably healthy options, quick friendly service and well worth the wait!!!  My goto breakfast choice when I'm in San Francisco, staying near Union Square. You won't be disappointed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place had incredible food! I ordered an omelet and it was huge and cooked perfectly. They serve the freshest orange juice that is literally squeezed from a machine on the counter and you can watch it work, which I thought was neat.  The other reviews were not kidding about getting here as early as possible, because the line goes out the door and around the corner if you don't. I got there around 8 a.m. and the line was already out to the front door. Totally worth the wait in my opinion though. I probably waited 15 -20 minutes in line, and another 15 minutes or so for the food to be brought out.  Some advice for when you visit: know what you want to order before you get to the counter! They are so busy, there is no time to waste once you've made it to the front of the line. The employees are fast and efficient, and they run the place like a well-oiled machine.  I will definitely be back!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is the REAL DEAL! Be warned, the line really starts to snake out the door around 9 am, so make sure you get there early. Menu spans numerous styles and flavors, with daily specials as well. The sweet crepes are outstanding, particularly the Nutella crepes. My wife got the Breakfast crepe and it was fantastic. A little pricy, but worth it. Clean and tidy place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Tourist trap. They are capitalizing on hotels in the neighborhood. Locals are not going here. Food is mediocre, serving size is small, price is high and wait is long. If you are looking for something convenient, then by all means. But let's not pretend that this place actually deserves the attention it gets. Look at my images and ask if you would pay $15 for these plates."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"These people know their business! Fantastic quality, great coffee, swift and friendly service,  all top!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place was delicious!! Coffee was amazing & the service was quick. There are seriously some hard working women and men working here. It was super busy and they still kept up! 10/10 would recommend
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The line of other tourists wasn't too bad and the line moved quickly. The eggs Benedict were good, however the line cook needs to slow down. Jovan found egg shells in his. Elouise enjoyed her salmon eggs and potatoes with ketchup. I did a couple of sides of 2 eggs and sausage which were standard diner fair."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Had the eggplant crepe with a side of bacon because, well, bacon! It was delicious. We liked the fact that you order and pay upfront and can leave as soon as you are done without waiting for the check."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The wait wasn't too bad and totally worth it for the dulce de leche crepe with banana, pecans, chocolate syrup and fresh whipped cream. I loved the service of them picking it the table rather than looking to find one."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was really good! The pancakes and eggs were delicious. I was happy that they have the chicken sausage as an option! We ordered for takeout breakfast. The food was done quickly and the staff was very nice. I would like to dine in one day as well.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Form at the cost of substance.  If you’re looking for your next jealousy-inducing insta post but care little (or are unable) to distinguish quality, you’re in the right place. Every plate looks seductive and delicious.  But for a dish meant to be delicate the crepe was thick and chewy, with a soupy filling hidden inside.  The eggs Benedict are carefully shaped, arranged, and plated, but the hollandaise is a sheer coating rather than a true saucy smothering. And the ham! Think “can”, not “deli”.  With the plethora of delicious food in the area, I won’t be coming here again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent breakfast, really busy though Staff is super nice"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Their crepes are a must. There are so many choices. Eden and Suzzette were our choices, and we were very pleased."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was delicious! Ordered the salsa crepe with side of potatoes. Line was super long though. Waited about 30 minutes before ordering and sitting down.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The pastas and burgers are really good! Different choices on the menu! Good deserts options! Tasty food!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"There was a long queue but it’s valuable enough to wait! I had french toast, egg plant crépe, bowl of soup and granola bowl with yogurt! Everything was great! Highly recommened for breakfast"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great food!! Night club music from Sinaloa  at 7:30 in the morning is a little intense when you’re having breakfast with the fam bam.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The service and food here was top notch drink were made well and food arrived on time. The pancakes were just right and the fruit was very fresh.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was lovely and the service was really good . Definitely will come back again when I’m next in SF.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I have been ordering food from this restaurant for 5 years now . I really enjoy their Crepes of all flavors .
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was alright. Price too. But the place a bit noisy and messy
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I ate French Toast from here, and while it wasn't as flavourful as I would have expected, I still enjoyed it. And the portion was a good size."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Crossaint was way bigger then expected which is good especially since it was so delicious vanilla latte was bomb too
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,We had an American breakfast: pancakes with strawberries and bananas- really tasty
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Sweet baby pancake 🥞 heaven. My lovely grandmother Martha from Finland, would cook what she called ""swedish pancakes"", for me and me only. I was her ""Erki poika."" Which means good boy in Finish. I loved her and the huge, thin, sugar toped rolls of swedish pancakes she made with love. Honey Honey cafe & crepes comes the closet to my grandmothers delights. Delicious!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious food. Hot & served promptly. Went at 2:30pm on Sunday and walked right in with zero wait. Go at 8am and wait forever.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The long line and wait time makes me say this place should get 1 star.  It was decent food..nothing outstanding, but I give them 3 stars because they had something green on the menu- spinach to the rescue!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We had a party of 7 and we all got something different from the menu. Every single dish was delicious. Service was amazing. The restaurant was packed, but we got our food really fast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Wonderful place to have a nice breakfast or some tasty crepes! The place has cozy interior, beautiful old tiles on the floor. Food was delicious and staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The only good thing here is a service of a staff accepting orders. Food is not delicious and does not look good as well. The worst Greek salad I have ever tried, not even sure why doe they call this weird thing a Greek salad? They probably have another understanding of this salad. Probably crepes are good here, but my experience left me with never come back thinking."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I had the regular eggs Benedict and my wife had the salmon Benedict. Both plates good 4 out of 5. Their coffee however, is delicious! Due to Covid, seating is only outside. There’s a lot of homeless around this area. Needless to say, during our meal we had 2 individuals walk up to us and ask for some money. One guy had no shame, he asked for $50...lol... either way, I’m just visiting this area. I would try another restaurant prior to coming back to this one just to explore."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast, fast organized service. Already know what I'm ordering next time."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious, abundant and they are super nice people! Highly recommend it!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"My favorite breakfast spot near Union Square. Unfortunately nowadays too many people know it’s a great place so expect long lines between 8:30 and 10:30a, especially on weekends. Good news: a) it’s still worth it, b) you can go here for lunch or dinner as well! :)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I was overwhelmed with menu options. I was confused. I felt bad for holding up the line.  It was hard to see over the tables so preview menu before you go. I enjoyed my crepe and potatoes were yummy.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"There was a long line but surprisingly it wasn’t too long a wait. They’re really efficient, and even though it looks really packed, they somehow found me a table.  I got the salmon scramble with the strawberry kiwi banana crepe and OJ. The presentation of the salmon scramble was a little sad but it was good. Very generous portion of salmon in the scramble which made it worth it. But other than that, nothing too impressive or mind blowing. The crepe was a little disappointing though. I thought the fruits would be wrapped in the crepe afterwards so it’s at least a cool temperature. But the fruits are like hot and soggy, the texture was just not it for me. It’s also very sour but they do come with whipped cream or ice cream so that kind of balanced it out. I’m not sure I’ll come back for the crepe again, maybe something else… the OJ was freshly squeezed which was amazing but dang it’s hella sweet. Ask for ice to go with it to help balance it out a little.  Maybe I had too high of an expectation for the cafe before coming in, so it kind of fell short of what I would’ve hoped for. But overall, it’s good, but not like mind blowing good (at least for the items I got)."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,when i asked is any drink included in a breakfast he told me that no. but actually flavored water is for free. queue move fast. potatoes which goes as a side dish is overfried. toast overfried too. salmon was oversalted on my taste. maybe they used smoked salted salmon which became more salted after frying. if you decide to go i advise to order avacodo to toast. my experience was max on 3 stars
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Just left the hotel and stumbled on this cute cafe. I had the breakfast crepe. Staff is super friendly, ambience is great and walking distance from union square. Definitely recommend this place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Came here for the first time and the staff are friendly and get you seated as soon as possible. Ordering is quick and simple. The freshly squeezed orange is a big hit for me and the chocolate waffle was gorgeous. Will be coming back again
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,My FAV WAS THE FRESH SQEEZED ORANGE JUICE.  My husband got the burrito and it was really good. Mine was eggs florentine and it was very spinachy. The nutella banana crepes was amazing!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Underwhelming. Two out of the three crêpes we had were definitely sub-par. The savoury Salsa crêpe was nice because of the salsa itself, but the Torino (I think? It was feta, mushrooms & spinach) was bland and dry. The Blinz was the worst - half-baked and filled with sickeningly sweet strawberry and orange jams, no real fruit save for two lonesome strawberries that were put on as garnish. Cappuccino was poor, bit the lemonade was ok.  Also, I get they're keeping some sort of an image with the décor, and I liked the blackboard menu, but the rest of the place seems outdated and decrepit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Outstanding breakfast full of yumminess and seafood. Go here, but get here early. It gets packed and for good reason."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I love this place. I try to go here every time I'm in San Francisco because it's simply wonderful in one of my favorite locations in the city. Highly recommended that you get there early because the place does fill up and there will be a line that may go outside, but it does move fairly quickly. Seating is pretty good for the place as people don't stay much past their time- but just be ready to wait for a seat in some instances. Even with all of that still highly recommended breakfast spot, but be careful since it does close fairly early."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,First time in here..will definitely be last... Very musky smell when I walked in ...put me off my food... Hot drink was cold..food was cold too Ordered toast the butter did not even spread well
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The savoury Pesto crepes are quite big. Glad I got the bowl of fruit salad as the side. If you are very hungry then potatoes as a side, will fill you up."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Lovely place to go for breakfast with lots and lots of options. I had a pesto crepe which had cheese, tomatoes, avocado and pesto in it and did feel a tad overwhelming so some simpler crepe options would have been nice. The oatmeal was also a bit watery and service could have been faster. However, the staff were run off their feet by the number of customers which in itself speaks for this cafe’s popularity. Solid place and would come back if I were in San Francisco for longer."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Charming place. Loved the crepes and other breakfast combinations.  So hard to choose when everything looked delicious.  I'm guessing it's a family owned place as the service and quality of the food showed a well working group that take care of their customers.  Be warned, the lines are long on the weekends!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"On Thanksgiving day in SF we wanted to find an open restaurant for an easy brunch and found this around the corner from our hotel. It was packed. I don't know if it's always that busy or if it was because of the holiday. We were wondering if we'd have to battle someone to claim a table, but they set us up and soon we were seated with our brunch. They had special sunrise scramble dish that was basically chilaquiles; it was awesome. I hope they make it a regular menu item."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Tried the eggs crab cake Benedict. It was okay, I had better ones before elsewhere, wasn't impressed. You have to queue to order your own food ( and the queue can get pretty long during peak hours ) Staff did not informed that that there's extra charges for credit card usage, I only found out after I looked at the receipt, would have paid cash instead."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast. It gets crowded fast though, so be there early!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Super nice staff. Good menu. We split the pesto crepe which was very tasty. The line is quite long.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, and great prices for such quality dishes. If you are looking for a good breakfast or brunch spot, I highly highly recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Try to go early in the morning to avoid at least 30min queu.. breakfast are really tasty. I recommend the salmon benedict
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I like that they offer ice cream as an option with the crepes! I had an SBK crepe and they accommodated my request for Nutella which was awesome.  The only con is that the bathrooms were a little dirty and not well maintained.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Ate here for breakfast when I was on vacation. I seriously wanted to eat everything, the menu is huge and all the combos for crepes and omelettes sounded so good. The one I got had tomatoes, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. Omelettes also come with a side of toast (I got sourdough because, uh SF) and a small salad. I really enjoyed the salad dressing they used, it was light but had big flavor. I missed a big rush but the line was to the door most of the time I was eating so plan a lot of time if eating during peak hours. You order and then find any open table and they bring the food to you. Big groups might be tricky unless you're willing to split tables."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is a great place, good food, busy and happening.  Very reasonable, no nonsense.  Great"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Large menu with lots of options. Everything we tried was tasty. Good vegetarian options.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Just amazingly delicious! A little Cafè not far away from Union Square where you can choose from fresh home made crepes, pancakes, sandiwiches (sweet and savoury), carrot or orange juice,  great taste and beautiful presentation. The expresso was good as well. Latin colours decorate the cafe' and a queue shows you that you are arrived at the right place.  Do not worry....the service is pretty fast (probably better to be there before 8 if you want avoid it) but it definitely worth it!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is good for breakfast/brunch.  Beware there is normally always a line out the door. You might have to wait for a bit but it is worth it. I would suggest they open up a second register so people won't have to wait very long. We had French toast, pancakes, and the Miami Heat crepe. All of it was delicious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Love this place! It's a cozy little restaurant with great breakfast options. Instead of a traditional ""sit-down and order"" type of restaurant, you first order and pay at the cashier, then they seat you. I found this quite refreshing and different from other places. Would love to come back again ♥️"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very Good omelettes and potatoes. The crepés were no my my favorite but were ok. Fresh orange juice.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is my favourite breakfast place in San Francisco, everything I've tried was super tasty. Good portions and good price. Friendly and helpful staff. Good atmosphere."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was delish! I expected it would be given there was a very long line outside and an equally long line inside. They have a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu posted on the wall, and they serve breakfast until closing at 3pm.  It's a counter service set up.  The food was great! I will definitely return during my next visit to San Francisco!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Pesto crepe = Amazing! Was the first place we ate coming into town.  The cashier was only so-so. I seem to be distracted and in a hurry, even though there was no one else in line behind us. The person that brought us our food was very kind and personable.  My friend said her sandwich was pretty basic run-of-the-mill. But I say when you go to a crepe place get crepes!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Casual ambience, good location. Friendly cashier; Abdul was very helpful, he even recommended me some places to visit while I was in downtown. I had a salmon sandwich and it was good... kind of pricy, but I guess that's San Francisco."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Reasonable price and food in SF. There was a queue to enter the establishment to order food at the counter, which wasn't the most fun thing to do if you're hungry. I'd ordered the Two, Two and Two, which is pretty good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Decent food, worth going to if you aren’t sure where to go"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The eggs benedict were ok; there was a flavor in the hollandaise that I really did not like. The coffee was adequate. Others in my group really enjoyed their food. I would come back and try something different.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I got the ""blintz"" dessert crepe and added Nutella on top. One of the best crepes I had! I am not a big fan of orange marmalade but their marmalade is great! Blends well with the ricotta cheese.  I also tried their iced mocha and it's good. Coffee is not overpowering the chocolate nor vice versa; it blends well and gives a nice flavor. Although the service is rushed, staff were not rude and tried to accommodate as much as they can.  P.S. Definitely add Nutella on top to balance the taste even more."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Can't go wrong with their Sunrise Burrito.  Although some would wonder why I go to a place known for crepes, to get a breakfast burrito. The chorizo is delicious.  With that said, don't take their crepes lightly, they are outstanding."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I visited San Francisco last year, ate here and it was unforgettable. Visiting again recently and the year apart has not dulled the experience. Amazing food, lovely staff and reasonable prices for the quality of the food! 10 out of 10 would recommend and would love to eat here again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Fantastic food. Ate the eggs benedict and SBK Crepe desert. Awesome place!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food and service, love the cute interiors and their unlimited coffee refills. Usually a huge wait, so get here at off times if you can!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Salmon Benedict was silky and lovely. Best potatoes we have ever had. Salmon was fresh and yummy.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast place. The breakfast crepe is delicious, and the food portions are great."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"So we tried out three places for breakfast during our stay in SF. Sweet Maple, MyMy and Honey Honey. Honey Honey was by far the best of the lot. The food is amazing, tasty & fresh. The price can be a little high but less than other places. The service is very good and the staff are really helpful. The queue for this place says it all but don’t get frightened away by this. It moves quick and they have a great system in place. Unlike the other two place Honey Honey will NOT disappoint. If we ever come back here I’d be happy to eat breakfast here everyday."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Avoid. Upon first entering, a man rushes up to you and barks a question about how many people are in your party and assigns you a table before you've gotten to the counter to order. The menu is impressive, but the actual food is far from excellent—below the quality you would expect from a typical greasy spoon diner. The coffee drinks also are subpar. The atmosphere is offensive: not only is the speaker system blaringly loud, they are playing the most obnoxious, trite children's music with mistuned instruments. It's an assault on the senses."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I arrived on a Sunday at about 9:30am and the line was up to the door. Three parties had left before they had a chance to order. I came here  expecting more fruit crepe options, but decided on a Belgian waffle instead. It was exactly what I was craving. Would definitely come back again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"They don't take reservations, there was a 50 person line out the door on a Saturday, and the staff was not at all cool when we asked if our pregnant friend could sit down somewhere inside, so she wouldn't have to stand an hour in the rain to wait. Sorry, but no place with counter service is worth that kind of experience. There are a ton of places in the area that are far more accommodating. 🤷"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Loved the Banana Nutella crepe. The Miami heat savory crepe was beyond incredible. Definitely recommend having breakfast here.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Amazing selection of items to have an amazing breai in downtown San Francisco. However there's a long line of people waiting from outside during the weekend and hollydays.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Had breakfast here. It was OK, nothing more. Pancakes were a bit stodgy. Whole place a bit tired."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The place is kinda dingy. The eggs with toast were good. It wasn't a ton of eggs, which I liked. The pancakes & waffles were really soft and kinda plain tasting. No matcha. I wouldn't return."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The menu offers a lot of options, but unfortunately what I ordered was just OK. Ordered the Sunrise burrito with beans and a bagel which wasn't good at all that came with butter and jam. The restaurant itself wasn't as clean as it should be."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"There was a bit of a wait, and no wonder why, this place is amazing. Went here multiple times during a work trip to SF. The fresh squeezed OJ is excellent too!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Decent service. Good food. Get there early because the line is long
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is essentially a mom and pop crepevine. Looking at the reviews, I figured let's give it a shot. I came on Sunday and waited in line outside. While waiting in line, they assign you a table and you tell the cashier your number.  I got a savory crepe which was decent. The portions aren't as good as crepevine and the potatoes weren't as good either. Overall I probably wouldn't come back cause I don't think value for money is there. It isn't bad, just not as good as I was hoping.  Whitney S. Milwaukee, WI 154762 11/12/2022 1 photo Fun place for breakfast! They don't take reservations so get there just before opening if you want a table immediately.  Food was excellent. Medium on price. Our only issue was that they serve food as it's ready ...which means it's hot, however certain orders came out slowly and the rest of us were finished eating.  General vibe  Priyanka S.Elite 2022 San Francisco, CA 635112133 11/8/2022 1 photo I went to Honey Honey cafe and crepery with my boyfriend and got the nutella banana crepe and a blt sandwich both of which were solid but nothing amazing.  The nutella crepe was stuffed to the brim with nutella and the bananas were fresh, the crepe itself however was a tad soggy and not as firm as I normally like.  The sandwich on the other hand had very crispy bacon and fresh avocado with a light mayo spread, once again a staple BLT but nothing extraordinary.  If you are looking for good priced solid brunch food definitely check out Honey Honey!  Nutella banana crepe  Jared F.Elite 2022 Ontario, CA 77245410 10/5/2022 3 photos1 check-in My overall experience here was pretty good. The portion size for the price is good, and the menu is quite extensive. The inside is comfy, and the service is pretty quick. The drawback I noticed was that the potatoes were mushy and lacked flavor.  Order: I got the Eden crepe which was yummy but had an incredible amount of cheese in it  My mom got the chicken pesto crepe which was incredible and refreshing.  My dad got the Crab Cake Florentine Breakfast which was pretty good and large."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We arrived for breakfast and realized it was a wait. The line was out the door and down the street. However, we were seated pretty quickly. Once inside it was a little hectic. People were everywhere (those in line/customers/staff) and the place is quite small. The female cashier seemed to be annoyed. Due to us being first-time visitors and had a few questions about the menu. Our order consisted of three orders of pancakes and they only brought out three very small containers of syrup for three pancakes each order. The syrup that was delivered wasn't suitable for one pancake. Upon delivery of the initial syrup, we requested more syrup. Again they brought three containers of syrup. I had to ask two additional times for syrup and the hostess seemed annoyed with that as well. Let's get to the food. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. If I never visited this restaurant again, I would not be disappointed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food and atmosphere. Don't sit by the door, it always gets left open."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I had the Belgium waffles and it was perfect. Service was quick. I didn't have to wait in a line as it was a weekend but heard that there are long lines waiting on weekends.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Breakfast are good. Good and fast service. Prices are reasonable.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"At first I thought I was in the wrong place. Two different music tracks playing at the same time (kitchen & dinning area) in an open space. The food selection is pretty good, quantities are generous, average quality. However the place is very dated, and not kept very clean. Trash accumulated in corners and under the tables, windows haven't been cleaned in years. A solid 3 star experience."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Amazing savory crepes!! The food was the star!  Kinda basic inside and long line but well worth it.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Location - 5/5 Entrance - 5/5 Staff - 5/5 Quality - 5/5 Quantity - 5/5 Serving time - 3/5 ( Serving is slow ) - All crepes are amazing and worth a try.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I waited thirty minutes for my food even though tables were open and available. We came at 8:45 AM. Food and service was decent but not worth the wait
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, get there early when they open"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast spot! We stopped in for a quick bite and ended up sitting down to a great meal. My wife got a delicious crepe, and I got an omelet! Great portions and super tasty food. It got pretty busy while we were there, so arrive early when they open to make sure you get a spot! The service was also quick, so no worries if you have to wait in line.  Overall, highly recommend for breakfast in San Francisco!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"For years, we lived down the street from Honey Honey Cafe and never went because the line was always so long. Finally we were able to check it out on a recent visit to SF, and we were impressed! My husband got the Miami Heat savory crepe and I had the breakfast croissant sandwich. Both were delicious and worth the slight wait. If you're craving delicious breakfast and in SF, check this place out."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Fast and efficient service. Great breakfast
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food is super yummy. The tomato basil soup is the best I've ever had.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I love Honey Honey for breakfast. Their Crab Cakes Florentine are absolutely amazing!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I stopped by after work one day. The coffee was ok, a little watery. I ordered the Blitz crepe, and it was really good. Just a little cold. Might be better in the morning when everything is fresh!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Lovely crepes and crab cakes at a very affordable price! Recommend to all
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food is ok. Nothing amazing. Had the crab cake Florentine. Was bland. Side of bacon was ok, but like something I would cook at home. The cappuccino was not good. Maybe I should have gone with the crepes."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I had the Santa Fe scramble and my husband had the two eggs. We both liked our meal quite a bit. The eggs were fluffy, the bread was tasty and the hashbrowns were yummy. The food service was fast. The americanos were ok."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A different type of restaurant experience walking in, reviews were good, so my wife decided this is the place to go. Good food options, but I wasn't impressed by plating presentation at all. Salmon Scramble was salty as if cooked in butter, small portion for $14.95, and a plate of unseasoned, partially burned Home Fries 😳. Coffee was good, and the wife enjoyed her food. I just expected more after guy at register told me himself ""oh yes, the food is good, we have good reviews"" 😐😐"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing cafe. Friendly, clean, and quick service. They had a variety of options which was amazing. I loved their crepes! I would definitely come back when I visit San Fransisco again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A very comfortable place to have nice breakfast, love their crepes so much, many different types, sweet and savory, but don’t like the salad though. i’ve ordered New oeleans crepes, chai tea latte, sausage as extra side. That vibe here is super❤️"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Lots of options for savory and dessert crepes, the strawberry Nutella with ice cream was perfect!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Super yummy.. long super line, but it's how we knew it jad to be tasty, and it did NOT disappoint!! Mmmm mmmm..  i had two, two, and two (pancakes, eggs, bacon), with a side of potatoes (tiny hash brown type).  It was ALL GOOD!  Totally hit the spot.. some of the best pancakes i have ever had!  (And im from Louisiana, so the food bar is HIGH!)  :)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Expect a line when you get here, but the line moves very quickly and the food is worth the wait. The staff here is incredibly efficient and the food comes out pretty fast. The mimosas are made with fresh OJ and are very good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Love the concept and food but not the queue especially in the cold winter.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The first breakfast place I had visited in SF and it was magical. The Pan cakes were amazing and freshly squeezed orange juice. I would love to visit this place again.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Got huevos rancheros. The bean portion with it was maybe 20 beans. I had to ask for the coffee that I paid for since they forgot and once I got it it was decent until I got to the bottom of the cup it was full of coffee grinds. People that were behind us in line got their food way quicker than us.  It looks like the employees are working very hard, kudos to them with dealing with the lines."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Huge list of crepes sweet and savory, fresh juices, full Cafe coffees and complimentary cucumber mint water 😊"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Tried this place out for the first time. My favorite was breakfast crepe!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,There is a huge choice to eat. The food was average. Not poor but not great. The service was dreadful. You wait in line to order and the guy taking the orders is rude. Uncomfortably rude! Then we had to wait for part of our order which didn’t arrive and needed to ask three times before it arrived. The place left me feeling annoyed. I wish I went somewhere else
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We got the scrambled eggs with potatoes and sourdough, the nutella strawberry crepes and eggs Benedict. The scrambled eggs were bland and the potatoes were not tasty. The eggs benedict were not runny which is a huge negative and the nutella crepe was average… I’ve had so much better elsewhere. The line and wait was also too long and food was overpriced. If they focus more on bringing out better quality food then this place will be a better hit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Do yourself a favor and skip this place. It is definitely one of those tourist attractions that people hype up, but it is not worth it. We were fooled by the line that was literally in the street and great online reviews. We waited in line 40 minutes to order. The food came out fairly quickly but it was not worth the wait. The food was under seasoned (everything needed salt) and the breakfast potatoes were under done even though I requested extra crispy. The crapes were also very soggy. A friend had a sandwich that was decent. The pancakes were something you could easily make at home. Nothing special. I suggest MyMy’s over this easily!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is a local hot spot! The food was very good, and very fresh. Expect a bit of a wait time though, every time I walk past, there's a line -- totally worth the wait!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Savory crepes for lunch. Excellent.  Good service.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great breakfast diner. Great service and good prices. Food was amazing.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food here was delicious. The wait time was a bit long, but it was definitely worth it (We waited about 10-20 minutes to get in and order, but food came out withing 5-10 minutes). Only thing I would change, is make some of the crepe options come with a side other than whipped cream or ice cream"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, there’s a constant queue throughout, nice vibes"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The staff works like a well oiled machine and served one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. We ordered the sunrise burrito and the seasonal dulce de leche crepe. Both were absolutely phenomenal. Lovely atmosphere as well. The guy that took our order was also so pleasant and adorable I wanted to eat my breakfast with him.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Awesome place with great food and service. Would definitely recommend the California sandwich!👍 …
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place was delicious! Just look at our pictures! They provide seating inside or outside and they have the entire menu on the wall so you can place your order before you sit down. Staff was very friendly and attentive I Definitely recommend!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This eatery was a few blocks from our hotel.  The food was good.  The menu is very large and makes choices a little difficult, especially in a small cafe where people are waiting behind you."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Excellent place for breakfast with plenty of options and large portions. I recommend the crepes. Go early as it gets very busy and you could have to wait almost an hour on the weekend to get in
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The pancakes were pretty solid and the pesto chicken crepe was amazing! The mocha and chai, however, left a lot to be desired. I enjoyed the counter ordering/seat yourself atmosphere, but don't expect to have any wait staff come around."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really cool breakfast spot. Lots of menu options. Expect to wait in line to order, but then food comes out quick. Both the SBK crepe and the crab cakes Benedict were delicious. Highly recommend!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Funky and delicious. Quick service, try the omelettes. Fresh coffee and juice."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great food. Very busy. Worth the wait.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,If your in San Francisco this is a must go the staff are amazing I wish I di not live so so far Away Australia we are coming back at the end of the year .
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good sandwich made just the way I like it, over from the UK and must say liked the place, good menu and food was really good. Would recommend you try it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was great but service a bit off.  Weekday morning was very busy with a long waiting line.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Completely wonderful place to eat!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Best breakfast spot in union square a must every time we are in San Francisco
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food tasted great and portion sizes were good.  Service was fine.  Wished we had found this place earlier on our stay as better than some higher priced alternates
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Staff was very knowledgeable of the menu and The Baklava Crepe is amazing, The crepe they use is soft and fluffy, I would eat them plain 🤤 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fabulous food, service, and atmosphere!  We loved it!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food was OK, service people were not nice, not attentive.  Would not return"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I rarely rate below 5, but the tofu scramble was the saddest thing ever. It was an egg scramble with what ""seemed"" to be little bits of tofu. Maybe I could have read the description better... but I just assume tofu scramble means scrambled tofu without egg like every other place. But here it just means a regular scramble with tofu bits. Also the tofu, or whatever it was... was disgusting. I've been vegetarian 12 years and this was the most foul tofu/fake meat ever. It was a bit sour for some reason. Maybe I got rotten tofu... but I'm too shy to complain or tell them so I just put up with it.  It's a budget friendly brunch place for sure, but wouldn't go again sadly. 5/5 front of house service though, the lady was super efficient and kind! They just need to take that terrible tofu scramble off the menu because the other food looked decent lol"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Experience was amazing. We ordered one of their seasonal items, OJ, Nutella crepe, and Bloody Mary.  So good! Very quick service. Definitely recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Would of went higher but eggs were over cooked, everything else was good. Of eggs were correct would of been a 4 star place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We always end up here in union Square after a nice bike ride. Decent food, friendly staff and lots of options. Fresh juice, coffee and delicious warm food. They have an awesome coffee bar too. The service is quick and can get busy at the same time"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Staff complained in Spanish (I assume in a weak attempt to hide it) that we gave them a 15% tip, even though they provide virtually no wait service. Table was dirty, our food was held behind supposedly because of our small tip- we had 2 bagels delivered to our table that had clearly been sitting out for a while about 15 minutes after all the other food was brought out. Their asinine seating method is highlighted by the fact that they do not have enough numbers for their tables. Do not eat here, would not recommend. Wish I could give 0/5 stars."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Now I know why they make you pay before the meal and not after. Way overpriced and horrible service. 14 dollars for "" huevos rancheros"" which was literally two store bought tortillas made into a grilled cheese with an egg on top. Service was horrible. They brought two plates out (my husband's dishes) 5 minutes go by, my foods not here. 10 minutes go by, 15 minutes. My husband goes into to ask and the waiter says it's coming. Another 20 minutes go by and it's still not here. My husband already finished his food a long time ago. I would've asked for a refund and left a long time ago but my husband insisted on just waiting. I'd go somewhere else with better service."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent crepe, coffee, and service. First but definitely not my last visit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The crepes here are as good as the reviews suggested. We loved it so much that we had to order a second. Highly recommended.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great food and staff. Food was excellent price is good. The inside is comfy and the service is pretty quick. Thank you!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This review is purely based on whether or not going to this place is worth it. We went twice and the line is out the door. So you'll wait between 20-60 minutes just to put in your order. Then, you can wait 10 minutes or 20 to get your food. The food IS GOOD. But for the price and the portion size, not worth it. Spent $30 on two people and I'm still hungry after. The servers work hard and are nice as they can be in such a fast paced place. It's honestly a fine place. But again, for the price, wait, and portion size, it's not worth it. SF has tons of good food. This isn't the only spot in town."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Honey Honey Cafe was worth the uphill journey while visiting San Fran...This place has it all..The food was great..the pancakes were actually fluffy and light..the eggs (over easy not runny) great..not to mention the fresh squeezed OJ.. This is not your run of the mil greasy spoon. This guy cares and that is passed along in his food (the taste and presentation) and service. The music was on par as well.  You need to come..sit..eat...Then bring g your friends. NUF SAID
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Liked the vibe, food was ok at best. I ordered the eggs florentine with spinach but I found the sauce to be a little bland and the eggs undercooked —got a little grossed out to be honest. The home friends were tasted dry and stale as if they sat out way too long."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice place, love the fresh orange juice and coffee. Plus good music. I was disappointed by the strawberry Nutella crepe. Strawberries are cooked not fresh, not to my liking. The Belgium Waffle is good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I had pretty high expectations. Was keen to have a nice breakfast before flying back to England. The eggs were undercooked, pancakes were average and coffee was ok. Definitely not as good as other reviews, would probably avoid in future."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The potatoes were delicious and so was the omelet
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Pretty good crepes. I had the basic Lemon crepe and it was good but thats a hard one to mess up. My daughter had the strawberry Nutella and my husband the salmon Benedict. They both enjoyed their meals. The fries were nice and crisp, not dry or under seasoned. I would say the food is great, but not necessarily worth the 30 minute wait. I would go in less busy times though."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good Breakfast, no long wait, orange juice was amazing, decent black coffee. I got their eggs benedict and it was nothing special but my partner got a torino crep whoch was very light and good. Their potatoes on the aide where perfect, nice and cooked with a little crisp! Service was fast, food was good, and resturaunt was clean."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious. I had the iced chai and the Eden crepe. The iced chai wasn't too sweet in my opinion which was great and that made it easy to drink. The Eden crepe was lovely. There was a bit of a queue when I arrived and I can see why.  Would recommend!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Come early to avoid the long line. The food was ok, typical breakfast. The lady at the counter couldn’t keep up with the orders, flustered at 8am(please open earlier). There was kind of disorganized harmony, you can see the kitchen had their rhythm going but the counter person wasnt keeping up. A long line of waiting to order hungry people(snaking all the way to the street corner), ubereats/doordash on the side, then me(ordered online). The counter person had 2-3 support staff fixing all the orders for her. Organization and leadership will go a long way. You will keep people moving, get more money on the cash register that way, just a suggestion"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Crepes galore, any crepe you could imagine.  Sweet, savory, even plain. Plus burgers, salads and more.  My favorite part of my visit, though, was how efficiently everything was run. The line was long, but by the time I got to order, I had a place to sit and my food was brought fairly quickly. The staff worked to get spots clean and get customers what they needed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fast, furious and efficient is how I classify our weekday breakfast there. The place is bustling and noisy, so don't go expecting a quiet start to your day. Order at the counter and grab a number for your table. The food is basic but good diner-level fare  (complete with Welch's jelly and butter packets) - with crepes as an added twist. Espresso was thankfully good.  Noisy dining room making the loud pop music piped in quite inexplicable."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food. Many sorts of different dishes with great flavor.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Birthday breakfast outing... Should have gone to Jack in the box. Went in shortly after opening on 10/13. Bloody Mary was gross, veggies in omelette were way under cooked, egg was dry, counter girl seemed rushed or annoyed. Never got checked on as other people did, didn't get prebussed like other tables did. Overall I felt unappreciated/unwelcome or like I was being a bother. Was going to order a crepe for dessert to go but decided not to. The potatoes were great and the mimosa was amazing."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great crepe, fast service even with a line out the door."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious. Have ordered from them numerous times and, despite some issues with how things are holding up to delivery-person's handling, still great!  Had only recently actually gone to the location for brunch. The food is even more amazing fresh off the stove!  Would go again. Best crepes I've had in San Francisco."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great crepes stuffed with food. Bring your appetite.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Quick no fuss cafe with an extensive menu and curbside dinning.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A group of 4 of us went here for breakfast and the line was out the door. However, they kept the line moving and we ordered within 10 minutes and then within 20 we had our food. We were very impressed with the flow of the small place. The food was delicious and the size of servings were great. I would highly recommend everything about this place. Homemade and plenty of options."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious!  We decided to try Honey Honey due to several recommendations.  So glad that we did.  We had the Miami heat and Eden crepes.  They were scrumptious!  Employees are busting their butts.  Great mael.at great prices.  We will definitely return and we absolutely recommend this establishment.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was pretty good, but we weren't given our receipt, our order was not taken properly, and we were charged for three drinks instead of two.  When I pointed out the overcharge, the guy looked at me as if I was stealing food from the mouths of his children and shoved me the money from the tip jar.  The service is way below acceptable, in my opinion.  And I couldn't withhold the tips, since the payment is taken right after ordering."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really nice. Their crepes are excellent (both the savory and sweet) and they come with quite a hearty portion of fresh fruit / salad / potatoes on the side . Was honestly super impressed by how tasty and fresh the fruit was, especially in winter! Staff is also very nice."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Tasty!  The Breakfast Crepe was excellent.  If you come at breakfast, be prepared to wait.  If you have time - it is worth it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The place has a good variety of food from Italian to Mexican. I tried the huevos rancheros, the crean Benedict eggs and a crepe and I did not like any of them. They were fast made, careless and the flavor was not good. The servers are fast and friendly. I think since they have to many customers and they try to serve fast, the food lose quality."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"DELICIOUS breakfast, good prices!!   👍🏼☺️🥓🍳☕️🍞 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast spot while visiting the area,  large menu selection and incredibly accommodating staff if you have dietary preferences/ restrictions"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast joint, awesome crepes! Yummy pancakes too"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,A great selection of sweet or savory crepes along with more traditional breakfast and lunch options. Tried to get in on a Sunday and the line was out the door. Tried again Monday and I'm glad I did. The crepes were amazing! The house coffee is forgettable but not bad. A bit pricey for breakfast but portions are generous and presented well.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is OK, food is not bad, but the lack of good atmosphere make this place forgettable."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This review is from a visit in September. Long line and tight seating, but the food was well worth it. Although this place is best known for its crepes, I broke from tradition and had the Belgian waffle. Topped with whip cream and fresh fruit, it was amazing and one of the best I've ever had. Husband had a crepe he really enjoyed too. Also the orange juice is literally freshly squeezed!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good coffee, good food. Easy wait even if the line is at the door."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This was a short walk from our hostel and smelled so good from outside - we were not disappointed! Their crepes were fresh and delish. We had the strawberry/Nutella and the Torini crepes - so good and plenty of fillings. Also had the tofu scramble; also yummy. Food was prepared fresh and was exactly as ordered. When you order hot tea, you get the whole pot!! We loved the intercontinental feel/vibe of this place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is so popular. I got here for breakfast at 8 on Saturday, and it was perfect timing: a long line built up after me very soon. I ordered a chicken pesto crepe (came with potatoes) and a blintz. Both were delicious and so fulfilling that I did not feel hungry until in the afternoon. The service was prompt and friendly, and the prices were great. Certainly the best breakfast place in the vicinity of Union Square. P. S., pay with cash and receive a 3.95% service discount."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very hot, fresh, and excellent food! I loved that they had an excellent variety of breakfast juices and smoothies here! Even though the line looked intimidating, the staff here was turning the tables around very quickly. I was able to have a seat and have my food delivered to me in a reasonable time right before my way to the airport. The next time I visit SAN FRAN, I will stop by here again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The breakfast here was absolutely amazing! The waiting time was quick, and when we got our order the waitress was very polite and got our orders ready in no more than 20 minutes. Heh, I know you should never eat at the same place twice in San Francisco, but me and my party of 4 couldn't resist stopping by again during our visit. I'd definitely recommend for anybody stopping by in the Bay Area!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was great, the service was fast for how busy they are in the AM BUT the cleanliness of the place could improve a lot.  Overall, good place! I would return."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent menu. Pretty good price for the portions. Breakfast crapes, with the delicious pure-orange juice. $$/$"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, average prices, awesome service :)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was wonderful!  Very happy tummy!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious food at a good price. We got our table number as we were in line so we didn't have to worry that there wouldn't be a table. If this were in my home town, I would be there once a week!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very good and tasty. I usually go for a dessert crepe, but it was morning, so I decide to go for a savory breakfast crepe and it was very good. My husband got the two, two, and two, which is just as good as anywhere else. The crepe on the other hand was delicious. Hoping to go back before we leave and try one of their Nutella ones. Almost everyone sitting in the place has one of those. Definitely worth checking out."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very yummy sweet and savories. Miami Heat was great and so was the one crepe!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"So delicious! I went for breakfast and lunch and I'm not sure which is better! Definitely try one on the crepes. Even if you haven't had a crepe before, you will find something you like regardless if you have a sweet to our savory pallet. The portions are plenty to fill you up and while the line can seem quite long at times, their service is spot on to get you in and get you fed! It's even perfect if you are going stag or with the whole family."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"WOW! So this is absolutely amazing!  So many savory and sweet options (or both).  Group of four - we tried many!  Salmon Benedict, chicken burrito, crab cake Benedict, churrizo scramble, blintzes.  Limited bar menu.  Staff were hustling to serve people as quickly as possible.  On Sunday there was a good hour wait (they do not take reservations).  The line never ended when we were there! But the wait was well worth it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great place and lovely owners. We had a great chat with the owners and they are lovely people. The place is always busy and you should be expecting to stand in line to order. However, it is worth the wait. Their omelettes are really good and i recommend the Acapulco or Athens.  The place has a family feel which i appreciate a lot. The place gets really busy on the weekends so you better show up before 7:00 AM."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fantastic place, absolute must with nice seating and atmosphere, and absolutely unreal food, it's about 60 dollars for what you see in the below picture. Highly recommended!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very busy place for brunch on a Monday so we had high hopes going in. Ultimately ended up being a pretty average experience. The crepe I ordered was good, but nothing special and couldn't get elsewhere for cheaper. The sausage/eggs combo that my friends ordered was highly disappointing for the price and looked like something you'd order at a cheap diner. The service was a little slow, but not extremely slow to the point of it being frustrating. The one redeeming factor is that at least the staff were very friendly. Based on the reviews both here and on other review sites (and the prices), we were expecting a lot more, but got a very middle of the pack experience instead."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We finally went on a day when there wasn't a long line. My husband and I were not impressed with our meals. His salmon Benedict tasted wet and limp and my crepe was ok. A little too sweet for me. I've had a better crepe other places. I tried another visit to this place and got a ham, egg and cheese croissant sandwich and was still unimpressed. I've had a great ham, egg, and cheese croissant somewhere else for half the price. The service this time wasn't good even though there weren't many people in the restaurant. Don't know why but now I'm sure the long lines are from tourism and extra PR around hotels near Union Square."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"had the philly steak cheese crepe and crab cake crepe. One tasted like cardboard and the other fishy, wouldn't recommend. Potatoes were eh......"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Super yummy crepes! The line takes a while but it's not too bad. It was just going out the door when I went and I was able to order in 20-30 minutes I think. The food comes fast once you order. I had the Half Moon Bay (the one with crab cake). It was good, but the crab cake was very average, not too exciting. My friend had the pesto and really liked it. We shared a strawberry nutella, which was very tasty. Overall, I would recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent service.  Even though the staff was overwhelmed with people, they maintained friendly demeanor and professionalism.  Food was decently priced and very tasty."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing breakfast for our mini-trip in SF!!! Long queue but totally worth waiting !!! You should definitely try their crepes. The restaurant is cute and lovely. Lots of choices made us hard to choose, totally energized after that ."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was pretty good and they got through the VERY long line relatively quickly. You'll just need to be a bit patient.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Decent food, but the place felt a little dirty. Definitely not worth 4 stars but is a decent casual food spot."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Full with a line for a reason: great breakfast in a classic diner atmosphere.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,To be honest! I just love this place ! I’m so happy that I accidentally discovered it and fell in love with it the moment I walked in . Their food is just so tasty and finger licking good. The owner is just an amazing person who took the time to get to know us and even remembered our names the second time we came . She gave us dessert on the house and was just wonderful. I’m just happy that I found a place that has great food and amazing customer service in SF.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Waited over thirty minutes to place my order on a ""less busy than usual"" Friday 10am. Not that bad. But I was forced to wait twenty minutes for the food because the staff forgot which table the order went to. Instead of being proactive, they waited for the customer to walk up and ask where the order was. Thankfully they didn't apologize for the mishap on their part and the food was perfectly cold so that made up for it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great and tasty with huge variety of options. Good price to value
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Service and food was on point.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice local restaurant! The food was great but as mentioned by others the menu is a tad overwhelming to read and expect a long line! The dining area could be more spacious also..it's a little cramped. However, I found that regardless of these inconveniences it was still worth it! Our breakfast was amazing and I would recommend to anyone in search of a delicious meal!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Line goes really fast! First come, first serve!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food here is delicious! I had the smoked salmon omelette and a peanut butter crepe special which was to die for! You will wait in line for brunch, but one of the best things about this place is that they are EFFICIENT. They know what they're doing and the line moves fast. Highly recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food. Took my friend there for brunch. Don't be afraid of the long lines. Their service is excellent and lines moves fast, food delivery is quick. I got the egg Florentine and hot chocolate. Yummy!!! I want to try the crepes next time 😊 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Wonderful food that was made fresh!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"If you enjoy being complained about openly in Spanish-( Sweetheart, we can understand you) and  having your food delivered to another table to magically reappear at your table seconds after going back to the kitchen, then waiting over an hour for a bagel sandwich this is the place for you! If that’s not your vibe, go ahead and avoid this spot. A lot of potential, poor execution."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was ok.  Music kinda loud for a breakfast place.  Could not hear the person next to me talk. Music also inappropriate for kids.  May just pick up food for takeout next time.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It's pretty basic chain food. The good thing is you can get dinner pretty late and when they messed up our order they gave us a second one for free. I ate the wrong order and my friend ate the right one. They serve breakfast late into the night and close at about 10  The place looks cute and the layout is nice and open, fun music mostly from the 90s. Servers are good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very delicious! Good music and good service!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice little place for breakfast and lunch near Union Square. They have a lot of crepe/breakfast and sandwich/salad choices and the food is very good. Lines can get long. They could use two people up front for sure (one on the register, one making drinks) so it can take a while to get your order placed and seated. Family and I had two different kinds of crepes and the breakfast burrito. All of it was very good. Crepe texture was spot on. Light and crispy edges. Toppings had excellent flavor. Burrito had flavorful chorizo, eggs and cheese.  Now, why the 4/5 stars? Value for the money.  I KNOW it's San Francisco, I KNOW it's the most expensive city in the country to live in, but....but.... $8 for one crepe......ahhh.....geez.....OK. Whew, I had to get that off my chest."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Was in San Fran for 3 days and ate here to of them. Amazing food! The only knock is that the line is always out the door so they need another register. Worth the wait though.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"From the east coast, by far one of the best pancakes I had in my entire life. Everytime I visit San Francisco, I always go out of my way to visit this place once during my trip."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good crepes, tasty house made citrus water, and nice atmosphere. Even though the dining room had a dozen open tables one night we were there, the waiter kicked us out because we had been there too long according to his judgement. We had been there for over an hour and a half, so it wasn't the end of the world, but his attitude was a little abrasive considering how much food we had ordered and how empty the place was."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"One of at least three times I've been to this nice restaurant. I always get the California or grilled chicken sandwich. The menu, posted on the wall to your right as you walk in, is fairly simple: crepes, salads, sandwiches, soups, and desserts. I am sure they're all good, and all items come out of the kitchen quickly. This isn't fast food, however. It's good food, prepared speedily."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Long wait. The crab cakes were delicious.  Only reason I️ didn’t pick 5 stars is they lost our order and we waited 40 minutes for our food. Besides that I️ would say it was very good. If you try the honey honey cake, make sure they warm it up for you. It was great with coffee."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Do not get confused by the ratings. The only good thing about this is the price. Not too expensive. We ordered food and when we received it came on chipped plates and not very appealing presentation. The cooks in the bag are sweating and not using hair nets nor gloves. My friend found a hair in his food and got reimbursed thankfully. The food is edible, but cold and you can taste the lack of quality ingredients. I would suggest another brunch place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food! I loved the Milano omelette and fruit cup. Long line but it moved fast. They are a well oiled machine with orders, finding you a table, and getting food out quick."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I live near SF and have found this to be one of the best crepe shops there. Started with their dessert crepes, which are nothing short of exquisite, but after having several others have found this to be a restaurant good to bring my visitors to when they're viewing the city. Never had a bad experience so far, and the resteraunt has a really cozy feeling that leaves you feeling as warm as their fresh crepes."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I strongly recommend this place. Amazing food and friendly staff. Since I can not drink any dairy, I asked one of the staff names Hinda if they have Turkish coffee.  She said no but then she told me that she has her own Turkish coffee with her and she offered to make some for us. After few minutes, she came out with a pot of Turkish coffee in hand. I couldn't believe it. We asked how much we owe and she refused to take any money.  Then she went inside and came back with a bag of coffee and she gave it to us. She went above and beyond and made such an amazing experience for us. Thank you Hinda for your beautiful smile and kindness."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We arrived around 10 am and there was a line that almost went out the door. Surprisingly it moved fast and most people ordered to go. We got a table for four and one of the servers/cleaners told us to sit by a table next to the door. We waited for her to clean it but she never came so we decided to sit at a different table that was far away from the door and wind. There aren't any hostess for you to sit, it's like a Starbucks but more spacious and of course better food."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really good for breakfast, went multiple times when in town.  Savory and sweet crepes I tried were all good, as well as the croissant sandwich and omelettes. Get there by 8a to avoid long lines, it can get crowded pretty quick.  Seems expensive but really on the lower end of SF prices.  Order at the counter but delivering food to the table can be a touch slow and have seen some orders getting mixed up."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Had breakfast at Honey Honey.  Very busy and a bit noise but your in the heart of San Francisco.  Fresh orange juice was really good but the food took a little long to get out.  Food quality was good but my college had the pan cakes and it was under cook.  Over for a decent breakfast not a bad place to go but not a memorable experience.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was wonderful ! I would certainly recommend this place for a good breakfast !
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Ate here twice for breakfast in the span of our 5 day span in San Francisco. Place is always crowded with a line out of the door for a good reason. Food is absolutely delicious, and you have to try the orange juice. Pretty fast service, and free refills on coffee. Cannot recommend this place enough."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I gave this place 4 stars.  Great atmosphere, available tables indoor and outdoor, food came out fast, and server was on top of things.  The only thing I didn’t care for was the breakfast menu was limited, and the food was so so."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Came here under recommendation from our hotel concierge, for a quick breakfast before we left San Fran. We had to line up for about 10min to order at the counter. We weren’t too happy about that but it was so busy we thought, this must be worth it..! I had a very delicious iced latte and a savoury ‘Torino’ Crepe, my daughter had a delicious bowl of porridge with fruits, and husband was pretty happy with his avocado bagel and freshly pressed orange juice. I’d go back!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is known for long waits if you go during prime time, but I understand why people wait in line.  The prices are great and they have a vast variety of breakfast options including crepes, both sweet and savory.  We tried both and enjoyed them.  The coffee was delicious also. It was slightly confusing for first time guests when it came to figuring out the table situation.  We opted to wait until we got to the register and were directed to a newly opened table with our number. I Noticed others confused about the tables and some tried to take them while waiting but were directed to wait.  Definitely go early! It starts to really pick up at 9 am."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Crepe was of good quality but the wait was insane. There was one large table ahead of us but we waited at least 30 minutes for two crepes. It smelled like dirty dish rags in the restaurant which always makes me nervous. Ok, but needs improvement overall."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Don't let the line scare you away! We waited approximately 40 minutes to place our order & pay. Crepes were totally divine. I got the breakfast crepe & my daughter got the Nutella crepe. We shared as they were a perfect complement to each other.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Get there early, even before they open if you can, this place gets busy fast. Food was really nice and filling. Good way to start the day"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Long wait on a Sunday which is typical, but pretty delicious food that was worth the wait! If you order the Blintz crepe, it's definitely insta-worthy, but the inside was a bit too runny for my taste. The crab cake eggs Benedict though was delicious, and the potatoes were cooked perfectly! They also have freshly squeezed orange juice which is a plus. Giving it four stars though because I ended up finding a hair in my crab cake and they took a long time to make me a new one (or just forgot until I had to go back up there).. other than that though I would definitely come here again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Best eggs Benedict ever. Crepes and Italian soda are good as well. They really hustle here. WORTH THE WAIT. The line was out the door so we almost left, I’m glad we waited."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious food, great service. The dulce de leche crepe is soooo good ! Recommend this place !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,It gets packed but the staff efficiently seats and cleans up after customers. You have plenty of time in line to review the menu so you can be prepared when you make it to the register to order. The food is well worth the wait and the latte just hit the spot for me.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Spent a week in San Fran and this became my morning stop, lots of options for breakfast! Loved starting my day here."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Large menu had everything we wanted. Outdoor seating during COVID. I had a chocolate strawberry crepe and mocha. My husband had eggs, bacon and a waffle with fresh squeezed OJ. My son had a chocolate waffle with milk. Delicious. This will be our go to breakfast spot in Union Square."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good food, a lot of variations in the menu.  It looks busy going in but tables clear out quickly and line moves relatively fast.  We had a party of 5 and a stroller and the guy seating people ensured we got a table big enough and with a lot of space even though they have mostly small tables."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Plain crepe with syrup was good. Waffle was great. Avoided the coffee based on another review. Staff was attentive and helpful. Busy in the morning, but tables free up frequently, so you don't wait to long. Good breakfast stop!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, there was a line on a Monday morning, i would suggest arriving before 8.  Food took a while but worth it.  Burrito was good but only had a teaspoon of sour cream at most, I would suggest asking for extra sour cream.  Don't sit on the benches if you're tall, or you'll be reaching down to your plate at your knees."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was really good and came out fast. The only reason why I’m taking away a star is because I think they need to do a better job cleaning their water cups and utensils.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,2 stars because my wife liked her crepe. otherwise this place is total chaos and the food is not worth the hour wait. my omelet was overcooked and portions are small. saw 2 groups of people get their food before us even though we ordered 5 and 10 mins before them. no line then eat here. if there is a line then forget it.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Went in for some crepe desserts at night after dinner while walking around town. Atmosphere was quiet and cozy, staff seemed busy cleaning for the end of the night. We ordered the BLINTZ CREPÉ it was Delish. Food came out quickly, and was devoured even quicker. Decided to have some flavored water. Very refreshing, not too much flavoring, just right. Could see other customers happy with their food as well."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Small place but clean, very organized,  friendly happy stuff"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"So I've got to say I don't understand the hype for this place!! Waking up later than usual on a Sunday, this was not our first choice; however, the reviews brought us here. There were 5 of us, and since the place was really busy, I asked my friend to find a table while we were waiting in line to order. One of the staff members came by to her and told her that she needs to get up and that seating can be only assigned once we've ordered!!! Well, 10 minutes later we ended up getting the same table. Now on to the food: The food was just ok.. My potatoes were under-cooked while my friend's potatoes were over-cooked. Just your average comfort breakfast food... I really don't get the hype.. The staff turned out to be friendly at the end despite the initial encounter."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good food but expensive.  A full breakfast with OJ and coffee costs $20.  I was a tourist needing breakfast in downtown San Francisco, and there seemed to be very few choices within walking distance of Union Square.  I tried Honey Honey and ordered the 2+2+2 platter -- 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 slices of bacon.  The orange juice ($5 extra) was fresh-squeezed on the spot, and was delicious, but it was served at room temperature, not chilled.  I was satisfied with the breakfast, very tasty, but wanted to give a note of caution about the prices."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,We went here on a Saturday morning. It was mobbed. The staff were a bit short with everyone.  A long line trailed out the door. The music was really loud so everyone was shouting at each other. The noise level was ridiculous.  The food wasn’t good either. The blintz was nothing like a blintz. The bagel stale. Sigh.  And it wasn’t very clean and the pain was coming off the walls in places.  Meh
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Affordable breakfast in the center of San Fran. A little bit loud.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The crepes are a total treat. I tried the savory ones. Friends tried french toasts, waffles and fruit platters. All delicious and generous portions. Great place to have / pick up brunch. Extensive menu options."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Standard American food. Florentine eggs weren’t bad and Belgian waffles just okay. Wouldn’t come back. Ambiance is also not my kind of tea with chart topping songs and families.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A very long line and crowded ambiance. The food is very good, I recommend getting the salmon Benedict."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"There was a huge queue to get in, then another queue to order. Overall it must have taken 45 minutes to order. I am not sure if this is because it was a holiday, or if it is like this every weekend.  There is a good selection of vegetarian options, although too much avocado for my liking. Still it wasn't hard to find something to my liking.  When the food arrived it was tasty, although a bit on the cold side. I might have gone for some dessert, but that would mean queuing up again. You have to know what you will want when you first order."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We had a party of 7, cafe was full and the host/busser found space for us. Efficient at getting guests seated and priorities and let's you know there will be a space for you."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The wait was long. While we waited a couple asked ""why are you waiting in this line"" we didn't really have an answer besides our friend wanted to eat there. After dinning though I can say we waited because... 1. Staff was very helpful and friendly. 2. Seating was very quick and easy... the staff move tables around and make tables work for the next person in line. 3. Food was very good.  Only reason I give it four stars is cause the price is a little high for what you get and the process to get a refill is a little annoying."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is ok, but super overrated. The line is long and moves somewhat slowly. The crepes and other dishes I've tried are average. There are a ton of options, so it's a good place to go if you have picky eaters. They do have really good fresh orange juice. Seating for large groups is limited. Cards, cash, and NFC payments are accepted."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Not the best service, but proper cups and no throwaway trash!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I've visited San Francisco the past two years and this is my go-to place first thing in the morning. I'm vegan and they offer soy milk, granola, fruit, and/or oatmeal which were perfect for me. I would like to try their Tofu Scramble but it (very oddly) has eggs! Go figure. Bustling but efficient and the food is tasty and filling. The staff is friendly and they even gave me extra fruit at no cost. Yes, it's pricey (granola or oatmeal with soymilk & fruit is $9.45) but it's San Francisco so that is not a surprise. Opens at 7:30am every day so get there early or you will be waiting in line, but even the line moves fast. You order your food, they give you a number, and bring your food to you. I'd return again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Worth the wait. This was our first time to San Francisco, and I read good reviews about Honey Honey. We did have to wait about 40 minutes to order, but it was worth it. It's a fun atmosphere, and a unique experience. They have a GIANT menu to choose from, but I don't think that you should leave without trying one of their crepes, it's like breakfast heaven."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It’s not bad, but it’s just kinda meh. Chorizo scramble tasted like frozen chorizo. Crab crepe tasted very fishy. Latte was chocolate flavored without telling me that (yuck). Just not for me."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Pretty small place, long line, and food was just ok. My sister got her phone swiped and she and the busser had to chase the thief down."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious variety of food. My partner and I were feeling something sweet and savory so we got and shared the French toast and the salmon Benedict. The French toast was to die for!! The potatoes were nice and crisp. Our friend got a breakfast burrito which he also greatly enjoyed. Affordable, fast, and scrumptious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is a perfect place for an inexpensive, uncrowded dinner downtown.  The food is good, especially the potatoes, and the service is friendly.  Reasonable prices, plus counter service only, means your wallet gets a break.  It is open til late in the evening, but the crowds are there only in the morning, and they have plenty of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and soups to choose from."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,My girlfriend and I waited for 30 min in line and another 20 min for our food. She ordered eggs Benedict with potatoes. They were ice cold. I ordered a Belgian waffle with a side of eggs and sausage. My eggs came out first and were  cold and my waffle and sausages never came out. I let the manager know and he was unprofessional and initially didn't want to give back my funds. Terrible experience. Don't go there.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great breakfast place in Union Square..wish I had more time to enjoy it..crepes were delicious!!!! Great customer service
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food was good, took forever to even order our food. Line was to the door and they were training someone.  She had no idea.  I think when its as busy as it was judgment should have been used and training should have commenced after the rush was served. By the time we ordered and sat down and got our food, we didn't care to taste the food.  we were so hungry we inhaled it. I'd recommend the coffee.  I enjoyed that."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The best breakfast crepe ever: cheddar cheese, ham, onion, bell pepper over egg and wrapped in a delicious crepe.  And for dinner, a chicken pesto crepe: swiss, tomato, garlic, pesto, fresh basil, and chicken breast wrapped in a delicious crepe.  I used to go every morning when I was going through the credential program at San Francisco State back in 2001-02.  Abed, you’re a good man.  Thanks!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Decent way to start the day.  Ordered the crab cake florentine and was left wanting. The crab cake was tasty and offered a nice crunch, but one of the eggs was overcooked. My chai proved a light way to start the day and the potatoes were the highlight with a perfect amount of herbs, cooked perfectly to soaked up the extra hollandaise.  Also swapped with a friend for one of his salmon Benedict's. The salmon had such nice flavor and I think it was better than the crab cake one. The salmon, tomato, and english muffin left a textural gap though because everything was soft. The muffin probably just needed to be toasted longer.  My friends also had crepes, a strawberry-nutella and a an SBK. Both looked good and they told me it tasted good too."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Came here based on the reviews that I saw. It's above average in my opinion; amazing selection of sweet or savoury dishes but the interior just felt a bit dated. I visited towards the end of the day so there weren't any big crowds and no waiting in line to order. Staff weren't the friendliest but they weren't rude eiher.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great service. Great food. Not the cheapest food you can get but the food price and quality matches the service. Amazing. It's not quiet though. If you need a quiet space to work, or are doing a phone or video interview, it won't be sufficient. The music will be blazing. However, the music choice is eclectic so it's nice"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Crab cake Florentine is amazing. Potatoes fresh and not greasy. Good atmosphere and friendly staff
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Order yourself, average food (not everything seemed to be freshly prepared). Very relaxed atmosphere."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Soooo good! Very helpful for our party of 6 and got our food out faster than I expected. I had the Baklava crepes and it was good!!! Would definitely recommend and come back again.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Come here for the chicken pesto crepe (or any other crepe for that matter) and the fresh squeezed orange juice. The normal dishes were good, but nothing special.  Don't be surprised if you have to wait in line for a bit to order your food, and or if table space is limited. The service is also not overly friendly or attentive."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We enjoyed the food here.  I found the menu, while offering a great selection a little overwhelming with the variety of choices.  The food was enjoyable but did not stand out as anything special.  As a counter service restaurant, the service was okay but, unfortunately, slower than I would hope."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Line was out the door, but moved pretty quick. You order at the counter, pick a table, and someone brings your food out. I had the Eggs Benedict - pretty good serving size and came with potatoes. The potatoes were spicier than I expected for breakfast potatoes, but still good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Let me just start with the bad things first....... LONG LINES!!!!!! Honestly, its not a restaurant for a quick grab... lines could take up the whole block sometimes... and they way it works is that you go in... find a seat then get back in the line to order, but what irks me is that most times a table isn't ready so even if your food is done you would still have to wait till you get a table, and by the time you get to your table, if you need something else, like another hot chocolate... you have to re enter the whole line to get something, because there is nobody walking around asking, ""is everything alright?"" But the food is very good tho... fluffy waffles, AMAZING HOT CHOCOLATE!!!! And absolutely beautiful crepes!!!! Other than that, they are a 3/5 for me!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"If you want an unrelaxed zoo, come.  Otherwise, I don't recommend it at all.  The food is meh but inexpensive.  Perhaps the draw?  The menu looks to mimic Creperie. And don't worry about showing your vax card...they don't ask."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Tons of choices for everyone!  Great vibe, very efficient and friendly service.  Best coffee I've had since we arrived.  Only downside was my poached eggs were not quite cooked - do be sure to ask for them ""medium""...will definitely be back when I return to San Fransisco!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, prices ok."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Theres a line to order on the weekend, but the quality of the ingredients is great. A fruit cup is fresh fruit is literally fresh and appetizing. The potatoes were my favorite part, they a just right and add a bit of a crunch which I really enjoy crispy potatoes."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the crepes was actually good. The strawberries weren't fresh and it took over a half an hour to get our crepe. We were one of 2 people that ordered and the people that got here 15 minutes after us got their crepes first.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place is amazing. It gets really busy so come early or with time to spare. It’s worth the wait.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good food but it's so so busy. Make sure you view the menu to know what you'd like before hand because you won't have much time to dwell on it. The food itself is very good and they treat you as best as they can with the rush of customers, they even find tables to accommodate for you so no need to worry about swooping in for a table. A bit too fast paced for my dinning preferences."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Huge wait, uncomfortable tables, mediocre eggs benedict and over-peppered hash browns. No thanks."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good menus and tasty food, but the long lines to get in could be vastly speed up by better workflow. If cashier were not also responsible for preparing espresso-based beverages (maybe use a second person who could deliver them to the table the way the food is delivered), wait time would be seriously reduced and more than a third of the tables wouldn't be empty, waiting for their future occupants to get through the line."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A small corner café with a great menu! It gets really crowded and has limited seating so have someone in your party grab a table as soon as you see one! There was a line out the door when we arrived and it never got much shorter. Quite a variety on the menu plus they will try to accommodate special requests, like putting your favorite omelet into a crepe. Yum!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Busy, but quick. Delicious food, helpful staff."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great casual place for crepes. We went evening but there was a queue outside for breakfast / brunch too which seems to be popular. I had the pesto crepe which was lovely and my husband had a breakfast crepe which he enjoyed. Very informal but great food.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Nice food and surprisingly not so oily. Go early to avoid long lines.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Awesome staff, great food. Place is super busy. Wait times about an hour on weekends so get coffee and get in line. You'll thank me later 🤗 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious breakfast crepe! We had the fruit as our side and a pot of Earl Grey tea. The fruit was a small bowl, but it was fresh.  And the tea was not very strong, so that would be the only reason for not giving 5 stars. We actually shared this and it was enough for both of us. Would definitely visit here again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The line is long but they hustle through it so that there are constantly seats coming open as you order then they help you get seated. The food is really good, the crepes are tasty, the blintzes great, and everything else good, too. Be patient."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I was just looking for a quick bite near the hotel... WOW! This place is great!  The Dungeness are in season, so I tried the Crab Cake Benedict, but this is also a crepery, so my companion feasted on a Mediterranean Crepe chocked full of olives, onions, artichoke hearts, cheddar, feta and avocado. Both dishes were accompanied by the best home-style,  fried potatoes I've had in years.  This is a wonderful find in the Theater District near Union Square (and within the shadow of San Francisco's original Trader Vic's on Cosmos which closed in 2004). The sandwiches look great too, but breakfast is served daily until 3 pm."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Fresh orange juice is always a treat. My eggplant crepe was fine. Big portions but fairly greasy as it was heavy on the cheese. Not Sure If the crepe was totally cooked through
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We are on vacation and found this place for breakfast.  So amazing,  went back.  I'd eat here every day,  it's so good! Had the Breakfast crepe... delish! And Belgian Waffle. Great taste and texture, and tons of whipped cream!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Hard to go wrong with crepes. Great selection and variety. My breakfast crepe was delicious and the fresh squeezed orange juice was a huge plus! Definitely reccomend.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Only one main complaint about this lovely place is their prices . $40 to $55 for a delivered meal.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really delicious pancakes, quick and nice service!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,So thankful for the kindness of the staff. They helped me when I was about to pass out due to pregnancy and were SO gracious. Plus delicious food!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing food, great selection, service was prompt and friendly. I will be stopping here again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Had the honey honey cake with some coffee which was very yummy but make sure you like really sweet food. Both the sweet and savory crepes are great. The service is quick and the servers and bussers are nice and efficient and helped us get a table once we were at the counter ordering.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Nice atmosphere but the food wasn’t great. I got the eggs Florentine which was soggy and I’m not even sure the English muffin was toasted. The egg whites were a little runny. The fresh squeezed orange juice was good!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,It was so good! The restaurant is warm and cozy. Good prices and good service!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really great breakfast place but they leave the door open and cold wind blows in the whole time, youre basically eating outdoors on cold days if you get stuck near the door"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, absolutely delicious!! So many different crepes to choose from, I got one with crab in it and want even disappointed! The line gets long in the morning, we even got there what we thought was early, so plan on having a bit of a wait"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I was excited to try this place until I found out they do not serve plain fruit filled crepes. I settle for there 2,2,2; 2 pancakes 2 eggs, and 2 breakfast meats. I subbed the meat for potatoes. The potatoes where burnt, the coffee was burnt, the eggs were greasy and pancakes were pasty and topped with cheap syrup. I sure they have great dishes but the simple dishes need a lot of attention"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,If you order the BLINTZ ....although VERY GOOD.... the stuffing is runny....not thick and creamy like an authentic German BLINTZ.  THE FOOD IS GREAT. THE SERVICE VERY WELL ORGANIZED. long line but it moves fast..so don't walk away just because the line is out the door.  Crab very fresh....duhhhh. Fruits are really tasty also.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Absolutely delicious!!! The Chicken & Pesto Crepe and Mimosa were amazing!!!! We had a mis-understanding regarding my order and they went out of their way to make it right and even brought a delicious pastry to my table. It's a busy lil' spot... as I sit here typing, the line is out the door,  but I can understand why... it was DELICIOUS!!! 👅"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Amazing meals at a great price. Huge selection of items to choose from.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Have just walked out of this place, I ordered the crab cake Florentine, the hollandaise had to have been off. I had to scrape it off my eggs, the taste was rancid, not palatable at all. I asked the wait staff to check with chef, who then went off and didn’t return to us. As we were leaving we had to go to the staff and ask what was going on with the hollandaise which he replied “they are going to switch it (the batch) with another one”. Pretty poor form after spending over $30 for 2 breakfast and 1 coffee."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Given all the rave reviews I expected more. The line was crazy long but you eventually get there. Food was good but not out of the ordinary. Better than fast food by a long shot. Prices were decent but just be prepared to wait.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food but busy. One out of two orders never came after an hr. Had to get a refund due to not having meal ready at all.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food here is average to very very slightly (""above average"" Some Dishes) I walked by this place on a Sunday. The line was super long and the inside was packed. I told my group that I was walking with we have to come back to try food from this joint. We all came back during to week. We ordered 5 different dishes from breakfast to lunch to dinner stuff, breakfast stops at 3pm. We all thought it was, just ok, not bad but just ok.  This Place is way too expensive for average at best food. 3 pancakes are 10 bucks lol. They weren't even huge. A side of bacon (3 Strips)  is almost 5 bucks plus an OJ and tax, thats over $20 for just ok food. Crepes are ok, chicken is ok, etc etc. The staff is super nice tho, service was good as well.  If you cant find or know of a place that's better, stop in. But those who are in the know or know great food when they taste it, pass on this place!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Situated on the corner, you usually wait outside and then wait to order before you get seated. Overall I waited about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The restaurant still had a line when we were leaving at around 10:30ish. Their menu design is the same as the one at Crepevine and Whispers, but they definitely have a different variety and more crepes options! Pretty good portions like most breakfast places. I got the chorizo scramble and the Nutella + banana crepe. Super full afterwards, but very delicious. Would recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent place for breakfast ! We waited a long time but it was worth it ! Very well organized, the waiter is preparing tables as we order at the counter, no waiste of time. And it tastes so good. Their crepes are amazing !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really great cafe. The crepes are delicious, and very large portions. Extensive menu selection. The staff is terrific, excellent service every time I have been here. Great local spot unique to SF"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It's good food but the hype is more than reality. The burger is tasty, but not anything you will remember after a day. The crepes are very good, especially the sweet ones. If you have to choose, go for the sweet ones."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The line was quite long when we arrived but loved relatively quickly. Orange juice was delicious and food was good. I had the eggs benny and it was a good dish. Not my favourite eggs benedict, but quite good.  Service was excellent."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Love the crepes here. Whether is the savory ones or the sweet ones. And don't miss the freshly squeezd orange juice!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I've been here multiple times and it never disappoints. Expect to wait, but they move the line along pretty quickly. I've only ever gone for breakfast, but enjoy it everytime. The lemon crepe is delicious!!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Top chocolate waffle. Bottom left Miami heat crepe. Athens omelette.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great variety of breakfast menu! European, Mexican, vegetarian, I think it covers most tastes. Service is fast and efficient, table is assigned to you while you wait in line, according to number of people, before you reach the cashier to order."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Seems everyone wants breakfast here the day before Thanksgiving. All seats are full. Line out the door. I feel lucky to receive my eggs benedict immediately after finding a table for one. Potatoes were a bit over & dry, but the benedict was perfect. Good coffee, but the free water is PERFECT!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food is good and the location is great right in the heart of San Francisco, but their service is kind of a mess.  Feels like they need another staff member or two.  The service was pretty slow both of the times I went.  I'd eat here again, but I don't think the wait matches with the food quality.  This place is good not great."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very busy location, prepared to wait in line for about 10 mins. Food items between $11 - $18 range. Coffee and beverages under $5. Great service, and good Chai!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Pretty good place for breakfast in Union Square area...
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was really good and the seating was handled pretty professionally, but nothing about this place really stood out. They have a huge menu full of good things to eat, but the line to order was horrible the day we went (took almost an hour) and the food wasn't that good. I recommend this place if you are a local and if the line is just right (not down the street)."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"When you walk to this place in the weekend during breakfast/lunch hours, you'll probably notice a long line outside. That's too bad, but it does show the food is good and it also is fairly priced. Look at Google Maps to see how crowded it is at a certain time and day, because a 'quick breakfast' might not be possible (due to the line)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great variety of dishes to choose from! All of our food was good, and the atmosphere was cozy.  We had the Florentine Crèpe, Migas (which I can't seem to find on the menu now), and  Salmon Benedict. All of the dishes were tasty, but I'd definitely switch from my crèpe to that Benedict next time... it was wonderful."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,We got the chicken pesto and strawberry Nutella crepes. They were absolutely delicious! Great place for breakfast or lunch
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Had breakfast here on our last trip to San Francisco. Very convenient walk from our hotel. A little busy but service was still good and the food was great. Loved the croissant sandwich!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Friendly staff, yummy crepe, good breakfast potatoes, nice atmosphere. However, really long lines, mushrooms in the North Beach crepe underdone, chorizo scramble too spicy, chai way too sweet (was it made with syrup?). Maybe the staff is too rushed? Would recommend trying a dessert crepe instead of savory."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Really good crepes here. I really liked the pesto crepe plus the mocha. They have an extensive menu so it is hard to choose :D
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Worst dining experience of our lives! Would NOT RECOMMEND.  A group of 8 of us from out of town decided to stop here for a weekend brunch, which of course is going to take more time, but we decided to wait. They make you stand in line for about 30+ minutes without a list you can put your name on or anywhere to sit. Which sucks, but we could have lived with.  They served our coffee boiling hot, and curdled the soy latte drink that 1 person ordered. When they tried to return it the barista said there's ""no way to not curdle soy"" and to just drink it anyways. Refused to accept it back. No one would seat us, and since everyone behind us in line took the tables we had to crowd 8 people around 2 small 2-person tables at either end of the restaurant. Of course once we were done eating they sat the group of people behind us and set some tables up for them.  When we got our food they left an INCH-LONG METAL SHAVING sticking out of the potatoes! When we tried to return it the owner of the restaurant laughed in our faces, threw us a $10 bill out of the register (NOT a full refund for the meal) and said they wouldn't do anything about it.  The drinks were boiling hot, the food was half cold, the service was beyond terrible and insulting. I'd recommend finding another brunch spot."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"So, we used to love this place, but a recent experience made me feel like I should leave a review and stop frequenting this establishment. My partner and I called in an order and walked the couple blocks from our apartment to pick up our order. When we arrived, we were practically run over by someone that looked to be a manager with no mask nearly pushing us out of the entrance that we were trying to enter, who gruffly told us, ""We're closed!"". This person was obviously much more concerned about the person that was trying to collect a few scraps from an abandoned meal than he was about health and safety, or just even feigning politeness. While we were picking up our order, this man walked back in with the meal he had taken back from the person that was simply trying to collect what someone else left behind. I stared. I really didn't event know what to say. We picked up our order and left, deciding that this would be the best way to call them out on this poor behavior."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The line out the door tells you everything you need to know! I tried the special of the day which was a Philly Steak Crepe. The Crepe itself was perfectly cooked and the dish was fantastic overall. Definitely recommend this place to fellow Crepe lovers
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Our family enjoyed coming here twice in four days. Can be a little loud aking with the music  but the quality of the food is great. Grilled chicken sandwich was a favorite as were the huevos rancheros which had a homestyle and rustic flavor to it.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"A fantastic, hidden gem which serves good portions of breakfast, lunch, and a huge selection of crepes. The service was quick, the food was fantastic, and I have marked this place in my go-to spots when I return to SF."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place was right down the street from the hostel I was staying at, and boy, I'm glad I stopped in. They had an overwhelming amount of sweet and savory crepes (in a good way), and lots of different coffee beverages to choose from. The food was delicious! Would definitely recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Torino and eggplant crepes were acceptable but the place was a dump. 75% of the tables hadn't been cleaned and in the half hour we were there, only a couple of them were bussed. The ones that were bussed just had the plates removed; they weren't actually wiped down and cleaned properly.  I grabbed a water cup and it had lipstick stains all over the rim. There was a large clump of hair on the floor a few feet away from our table. The place looked like it hadn't been swept in days.  Will definitely NOT be going back here."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I don't know how this place got a 4.1 star overall review. There is nothing special or outstanding about this place. An unfriendly lady at the counter, making sure she doesn't smile even once and no friendly word. The atmosphere in the cafe is cold, a place you don't want to stay for long. Nothing cute or cozy, which a real creperie normally feels like. The food was bland. It was okay, not bad not great. Hot chocolate was good. If you know good creperies in other cities and are visiting the city to look for one (like we were), try to find a real French place. This one isn't it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Incredibly long line and the took over an hour to get an omelette and sweet crepes. Wasn't  even worth it! Omelette had chunks of raw onions and the crepe was bland and mediocre. Overall, save your time and money and have a better experience elsewhere"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent service, great food, low prices for high quality dishes. I always get the Union Square Burger (add avocado) with curly fries. Can't be beat in this touristy area. Great crepe and breakfast options as well."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is so good and they have a nice selection for breakfast. Lots of choices, but you can definitely find something good. Eggs are stove of the best. Crepes are excellent. Staff is very helpful and very cool looking atmosphere."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, fun menu, but what I lived was the welcome and the warmth. I am on a mobility scooter. I'm used to getting cross looks when I show up needing help with the counter service. Here I felt welcome. Thanks, y'all!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Cashier/server was frazzled, even though there was hardly anyone there. She punched in the wrong order but replaced it with the correct one without charging me again.  Food wasn't bad. Large portions. Coffee was no good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,It was good not the best breakfast. Owner was cool though but eating on the sidewalk was the best and worst experience. Peopl walking by passed too close when we were eating.  I guess the risks you take eating outside in 2020
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great food, long lines. (our wait time appx. 45 min., get there early) You have to order before you sit down and you are not allowed to save seats, they are for customers who are ordering food. A waiter/bus person gets the table ready for you as you are waiting in line and then tells you the number table to go sit at when you are ready to order. Loads of items on the menu to choose from. Filling and delicious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Ordered a salmon bene and this is what I got.. eggs were over cooked. Very disappointing
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Went on a Saturday, and waited in line about 30 mins. It went by quickly! Once we sat down, it was worth the wait. We shared the Nutella crepes, and sunrise burrito. Both were delicious!! Would definitely go back!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Fairly lively and open late. Got a chicken pesto crepe with fruit salad. Would think that a place specializing in crepes would be able to make a good batter without overcooking it. The filling was fine. Fruit was cut but stems still on it
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Love this place! Wonderful breakfast choices & the most amazing orange juice I have never had. Be sure to have a look at the specials. There is a line in the morning, but it is worth the wait. And it give you time to make your mindon what to eat!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Part of the joy of traveling is discovering places like this. Great menu for any meal of the day. I popped in for a late breakfast and was completely delighted with the Cable Car omelet. Ate every bite and now need to take the long way around to the hotel to pay for the indulgence. Will be keeping this on my list of places to revisit.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The queue was massive, but the wait was well worth it.  The food was delicious (I had a chocolate waffle with bacon on the side) and the service was great.  Would definitely go again for sure."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great place for a crepe. I personally loved my crepe with strawberries, but the lemon crepe my friend ordered was way too lemony (super sour). He couldn't finish it because of that. The other crepes were good, however."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food. Restruants needs updated.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"As long as you go in knowing you're going to wait in line for a while, this place is a-ok. Good, not great, food at a reasonable price for the area. If it took a little less time to get your grub, this would be a 4-star for me, but the food's not quite good enough to justify the wait time in my opinion."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Breakfast was great, customer service was good also. Just make sure to get there early to get a seat because it gets pretty busy."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great place for breakfast. Tasty food, huge selection, fast service, good price."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and waited in line for a good twenty minutes (the line was out the door!). It’s the only place I have found with a huge array of breakfast items (crepes, omelettes, eggs, French toast, everything...) in the area. Not particularly special but, one of those places that just hits the spot."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I'm so glad we stopped here for breakfast! I seriously miss the food here. Their food is delicious and with just the right amount of seasoning! Definitely going back if I ever come back to San Francisco.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great crepe and amazing waffle. Be inside sharp 7:30 AM if you want a early breakfast to start your day otherwise their is always a long queue cause of tourists and its amazing flavours.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Was our first time in San Francisco, Honey was the first place that we visited and our experience was really satisfied!! The food is really really good, the service is exceptional, the prices are fair! In overall was a really good experience!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food here was generic and disappointing given the wait. This is basically no different or better than getting run of the mill diner food. The Crepe was overcooked and the eggs needed salt. I would not come back. There are many better options in the area with similar or shorter wait times.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious selection, fresh ingredients, tasty coffee (per my hubby). On a Friday the service was very quick!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,When we walked up and saw the line outside the door we knew there must be something special about this place. Crepes were good. Coffee was so so. Service was good. Overall a nice experience but unfortunately we’ve had better.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Pretty good food! Gets very busy so be prepared to wait! Food was alittle cold when it finally got to our table that's the only downfall but it was still good. I just hate cold breakfast food when it isnt suppose to be.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Slow service, terrible atmosphere. Food took forever, staff complained about ""only a 15% tip"", held back our food, and terrible system of serving. Dont go. Honestly worst part of the day was eating here."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We came in with high hopes based on some decent yelp and Google reviews. We waited for about twenty minutes outside, but the real wait came after we had ordered at the counter and PAID for our food. Not unusual to see people that order after you served before you, but we inquired anyway. Four different staff told us they would check but never came back. Remember, we've already paid. Finally I go to the counter prepared to make a scene and finally get to speak to someone who appears to be in charge. He says ""sorry"" and says he'll get our food out right away. Order came out wrong and was mediocre at best. They refused to refund our money. Absolutely horrible experience. AVOID THIS PLACE!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really good food, but it was all brought together by the staff. They were busy but still friendly and helpful. Extra kudos to the man wearing a gold necklace who was serving; he was very aware of what the customers needed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food is really good. But definitely get there early. The orange juice is amazing!!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Love the food and the menu had great options. Didn't have to wait a long time for my food to come. Customer service was good and welcoming. Will come and visit again soon.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"decent food, but service was bad, they make you stand in line to order, while tables sit empty, instead of jut seating you and taking your order. all the staff I interacted with seemed very rushed. prices are ok I guess. food was good, but nothing to write home about. coffee was pretty good. can't recommend honey honey with how the ordering process currently is."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I usually don't find restaurants giving good food near humdrum touristy areas because they know that they will get business even serving below average food. This place was impressive. Plus special mention to the hostess who was cheerful. That is unusual too for such high footfall areas where one usually gets snobbish arrogant hosts.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Had high hopes given all the high reviews. But found the savory crepes lacking flavor and the sweet crepes way too sweet to eat as a meal.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This is a no-nonsense place with great food! Fantastic staff that really helps to make you comfortable while they serve as much people as they can.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Overpriced and overhyped. The pancakes were definitely made from Krusteas just-add-water mix, and the ""whipped cream"" on the crepes was actually Cool Whip. Considering that breakfasts started at $8 for two eggs, I would not recommend this place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We had a great, late breakfast here; both waffles and crepes were delicious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food was amazing! Great service, even though the queue was long, it went by fast and the food came out quickly! We had the ""Miami Heat"" and ""Breakfast"" crepe. I HIGHLY recommend this place for breakfast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I think this is the Best breakfast place in San Francisco. Surely you have to wait in line to place your order at any time of the day. But it's totally worth. I usually get Sunrise Burrito with hot beans and side of home fried potato.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very cute and easy spot for a breakfast/brunch spot. I went at 1pm ish on a Friday with no wait. We tried to return Sunday for a quick bite and the line was outside and around the corner. Food was delicious!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I'm a tourist, and i strongly recommend this place!!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,First breakfast place as tourist in SF and enjoyed. Well recomended ;)
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Spanish style crepe place. Nice vibe on the corner.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great service and a lot of delicious options! We went here for breakfast for with a group of 11 people and everyone had a great meal. Eggs, french toast, fruit, crepes, waffles, and potatoes were all outstanding!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Was excited by the menu.  The staff COMPLETELY RUINED IT.   While sitting down we were stopped stating to try to find other seating in case.  The gentleman who stopped us was assumably going to help us find said spot but instead ran off to the back while a different group of 4 took THE SAME SPOT.  The owner gave out half our order to the group that sat down next to us 20 minutes AFTER we ordered.  When even attempting to get his attention he stated 'It's coming out!'..... Well it's now been 15 mins, half the party is done eating.  Bottom line: the wait is fine, I'm willing to understand that for some places the wait is worth it, but the disorganization is an absolute killer"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Absolutely scrumptious. There by 9 am on Friday waited only 30 min amazing the line moved fast. Eggs Benedict perfect Lox and bagel a winner Huevos rancheros scramble savory and delish Great speedy service Super clean
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good crepes, lines can be long when it is busy, but worth the wait!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food is delightful! I enjoyed the iced chai tea so much I had one to go. My mom felt the chicken sausage needed more seasoning but I enjoyed it. Good place!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"One of the best breaksfasts my wife and I have ever had!  Delicious!  We are in SF on our honeymoon and can’t recommend this place enough.  Prices extremely reasonable as well, which is incredibly difficult to find here."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"You’ll have to wait 30 mins to 1 hour for brunch, which is normal for a weekend brunch in SF. The scramble was cooked medium-well and tasted ok. Maybe some sauce would have spruced up the meal.  I’d just get the crepes or the specials. The mimosa and bloody mary were good, tasty and worth the wait."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Exactly what I was looking for, a quick place to have a good, non-fast food breakfast.  I had the crab cake florentine: eggs were perfectly cooked though the crab cakes were a little overdone, still quite delicious.  Iced Americano was a bit bitter at first but ended up well.  Overall a good local breakfast place (and less than a block from my hotel, too!)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Beat menu at really good prices. Also the cashier Elena is a rock star. I left a key behind at the restaurant and she helped me find it. Would highly recommend
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The menu is not descriptive regarding their ingredients. I originally ordered chicken parmesan which is usually made the same no matter where you go; however, here it is completely different. The chicken was not breaded and it was spicy. It also had mushrooms which is unusual for chicken parmesan. However the French fries are really delicious. The Nutella crepe was also good but would have been better if the waitress had brought the ice cream with it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I can't comment on their whole menu, which is quite extensive, but the Strawberry Nutella crepe was spectacular! It was stuffed with fruit and nutella for a yummy combination. It was quite empty at night, but open until 10pm so it was a good stop for dessert. Not too far from Powell shops."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Cozy restaurant but seems big enough to fit larger-sized groups. Order at the front and take your number. The food came out fast and is reasonably priced. Minus one star because there was no AC when the weather hit 97F.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Cozy cafe with menus on the walls.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner served with a good variety.  They also have specials listed.  Like the crepes served with potatoes, salad or fruit.  I had the fruit and it was wonderful..bananas, strawberries and apples.  Friend had tomatoe sauce spaghetti with shrimp and it was a large serving with garlic bread."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is one of my two favorite crape joints in the city. I haven't tried much more than crepes on the menu, but when I go with Friends or Family the other food items they order look wonderful and from bits and bites I ask friends for, I haven't tasted anything I haven't liked. I'm a very picky eater. My Friend ordered Salmon once and I couldn't try that (hate fish) but she said any Salmon eater would be impressed. I usually order the Strawberry Nutella Crepe. It's absolutely Devine. I've also had various omlett crepes. The line is rather long, depending on when you go, but it moves quickly. And from order to serve is extremely quick, and a welcome unexpectance. You can also order for delivery."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Had a catering order for about 12 people early in the morning and Abed made sure we were taken care of. Never did i have to worry if the food would be ready. The service and food was great. Came back to order from them about 5 more times and always will if I’m back in the area.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Ok food with an ""affordable"" price. It was still quite expensive for me but compared to the area's prices, it was pretty average.  We got there just after 8 am, the staff was not courteous and there was a bit of a line and the restaurant was quite full. We were lucky...Close to 9 am there was a line that reached outside the door.  Thank food was ok for a breakfast. Two plates of eggs woth toast and two OJ was around $20.  Price 3/5 Place 3/5 Food quality 3.5/5 Service 3/5"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Our favourite breakfast spot while staying in San Francisco. The queue gets long but don’t be put off, the food arrives quickly once you do get your order in."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This is a really fun place that is jam packed every time I walked by, but I finally tried it and was really glad that I did. Crepes were so delicious, great espresso and very fast service once you get past the line. Great place to bring kids, or a family."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great salads and tasty sandwiches. Word has it that the Belgian waffles are good as well. Our Tuesday lunch spot - order ahead for take out, as the wait time can be long"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Order and pay at the counter, then food will be delivered to your table by number. Good savory and sweet crepes. A little on the loud side, between the breakfast crowd and kitchen noise. Like others said: don't be intimidated by the line."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great food and service. We were impressed by our crepes and the shockingly good latte for under $4. Would definitely eat here again.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,There breakfast croissant is a must while in San Francisco!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I would not come here again. I ordered Lox on an everything bagel. They brought me a plain bagel, with no explanation! The lox was in a glob and the center was the gray-brown fat layer between the skin and the flesh. I brought it back and the manager argued with me. Reluctantly she gave me more salmon just again to include the same gray-brown fatty fringes. Meanwhile the bagel became soft and soggy, she scraped that on a new plate and I was left without onions and capers... not accommodating, not nice people! Also, the prices in the restaurant are about $1.50 per item more then posted on their website… And there's no air conditioning, it's hot and muggy…"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Haven’t even had a bite yet but the OJ is amazing and the music is fire. Staff is friendly and attentive. 10/10 would recommend!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Tip: Arrive as soon as doors open. Line quickly formed. Great Breakfast
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"As the first time to visit San Francisco near Union Square, and you are looking for a nice and quiet place to have breakfast and brunch. Honey Honey Cafe is a good choice. It has delicious pancakes, waffle, apple sauce sausages, and fruit.....etc. Will visit again. 😄 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"TO OWNER: COOL WHIP is just cheapo hydrogenated vegetable oil. It's disgusting and it's bad for you. Don't use it as whip cream on your crepes.  TO OWNER: The blintz crepe was gross. It was a soggy mess of sugar and something else. Barely any blintz like features. Unrecognizable. Don't call it a blintz if it's a soggy sugary mess. And it was $9.  TO OWNER: You packed our tea kettle with three times as much tea as it should have. It was like drinking pure bitter. Nice job!  OTHER THAN THAT, Breakfast crepe was good, but vegetables were not cooked?? Uncooked onions?  Crepes were soft and moist though.  This place could be great if they fixed these details."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Outstanding crepes!  Loved the Nutella Chocolate one.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good breakfast, we had the breakfast crepes, eggs your way and the SKB sweet crepe. The sweet crepe was ok, not many kiwis. The breakfast crepe and the eggs were delicious. Good coffee, fresh squeezed OJ. Normal SF prices (a little higher than Portlabd)."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I came by one morning to order their crepe suzette with a side order of vanilla ice cream to start my day, only to be greeted with a crepe drowning in freshly squeezed orange juice. The overbearing tartness of the fresh juice created a pool on my plate where the buttery flavor of my crepe drowned in. Seeing as how this place is supposed to specialize in crepes, this certainly did not make me want to go back to try out their specialty again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"For those of you from Sacramento, this place is VERY similar to Crepeville. In fact, their items on the menu and the chalk drawn menus themselves is almost a mirror image to Crepeville.  They have a large variety of crepes. We have ordered many things from the menu, never a disappointment. Food is delicious and comes out fast. My husband and I always order the Pesto and Eggplant crepe. Just be sure to avoid rush hours, as a lot of the tourists like to go there as well."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The menu choices are extensive for breakfast and lunch. The selection allows for something sweet or savory. The ordering process is a little slow and the tables are small but the food is good. We had lunch and would go back to try other menu items for breakfast.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Visited numerous times for breakfast over the course of our holiday. Great selection ( even for a vegi ) of bagels, omelettes and other breakfast food. Fast, effecient service. Just remember to order first then find a table."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good breakfast but too much. Excellent fresh orange juice. Good pot of tea
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious for kids and adults! My hubby forgot to order my breakfast crepe without bell peppers and they remade it even though it was our fault. Next time I'm in the area for breakfast I'll be back!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Tasty food, excellent honey cake."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Long line but good food, right near hotels for an easy breakfast within walking distance."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Overall disappointing experience. We ordered a salad, a breakfast crepe, and egg scramble for three people, with a Nutella strawberry crepe to split. Also ordered two teas and an orange juice. The salad had a nice presentation, but you can tell the ingredients are less than quality, and it seems almost lazy. Presliced cheese, deli meat, cherry tomatoes sloppily chopped in half, and shredded carrots over lettuce. I was particularly with my breakfast crepe, which had very few eggs and way too much cheese. I ended up just eating the eggs out from the inside. My brother seemed to enjoy his scramble, but I tried it and found it strange in consistency. Luckily the Nutella crepe was actually quite good, but then again it isn’t difficult to put Nutella and strawberries on a somewhat average premade crepe batter. I would have honestly been fine with this experience if all that didn’t cost 60 dollars, the inside of the restaurant didn’t feel so cramped and unclean, and it wasn’t supposed to be one of the best breakfast spots in the city. Would not go again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Another super popular and crowded brunch spot for tourists. The crepe with pesto is good. My friend ordered crepe Miami or something but somehow it has the flavor of alcohol .
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I ate here a couple times. I had the savory pesto chicken crepe, the nutella crepe, and thre cobb salad. The salad was my favorite but all the food was good. I felt like it was a little over priced but I guess that's just Dan Francisco"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very popular! Queue to order. No table service. Loud music; cheap speakers. Espresso coffee tastes like drip coffee. Tasty scrambled eggs. Ok prices.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Coffee was wonderful, great chicken sausage, peanut butter crepe was perfect, Belgian waffle was good but not amazing but the fruit and whipped cream topping was indescribable. Definitely worth the line."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Got the breakfast crepe, they messed up my order, didnt say anything about it and brought my food out late. When I got it, it wasnt what I asked for (light cheese, just not as much as normal, I'm lactose intolerant, and they put extra), and the extremely large pieces of bell pepper and onion weren't cooked, they were raw. Wont be back, but I guess it was worth a try."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Friendly place with a wide variety of crepes. Had a savoury and a sweet crepe. Seems like a go to place for tourists.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Quite a treat awaits anyone visiting this little treasure, tucked away at an unassuming corner just down the street from SF's Union Square. Great breakfast, friendly service and even WiFi. Not only is the coffee barrista level, but if you like crepe, this place is a must.  The line speaks for itself, but is well worth the wait."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Loved the food, very good portions and tasty."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The number of good reviews brought me to give it a try. Tried their pesto crepe. Just not bad, in the end.  Overrated as I expected high of the restaurant.  And they're kinda under-staffed undoubtedly so service and speed is so-so."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Walked in for breakfast, walked out seven minutes later after being told we weren't in the correct line (when there had been no outside line before) and we needed to go wait outside.  A better wait system would be helpful. The Starbucks around the corner fit the bill."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is a hidden gem. For the price, the food was delicious and quick to arrive. As a visitor, I would be fine with breakfast here every day but I want to try out other businesses!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good service and pleasant,busy setting. Had basic dishes - cheddar cheese omelet, apple cinnamon crepe and coffee. All was very ...basic. A lighter crepe and more syrup from the compote would be good. Food is filling."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Honey Honey has a great variety of crepes and they always update their menu! My new favorite is bounty crepe ( coconut and Nutella I think)! Also they make good chai late! However the portion size is not as good as some other places around, food needs a little bit more ""decoration"" and seats aren't that comfortable. In overall the place is totally worth checking out!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Went on a Friday at 9.15am.  When you enter, there is a sign that says wait to be seated.  There is a line that everyone is queuing.  I joined in anyway for a while to see what the system is.  Anyway, you order over the counter, take a number and then pick you seats.  All in all, 15-20 mins already passed.  Fortunately, my food arrived within 10 mins of ordering.  I had a 2+2+2 with the bacon and a latte.  Latte was awful.  Asked for tomato sauce and the lady just pointed to the side table (where the spare condiments are located).  I was seated at a bar because I didn't want to take a 2 seater table as there are sill people in the queue.  Most tables had condiments in it, except mine - hence my question, I didn't know where they were.  Food was so so.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong item.  I think the savoury breakfast crepes would have been better.  If you are reading this, I would suggest not paying the tips when ordering over the counter.  Pay it later if they deserve it...there ate minimal service anyway."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was really good!! The food was delivered less than 5 min of being seated. Service was pleasant. Overall good experience 😊 …
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We don't come to SF often because we're not big city lovers, but when we do come we stop at Honey Honey to have Bfast. Their Eggs Benedict, country fries potatoes and bacon are my favorite and don't forget a crepe for dessert!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Best crepes in town! Staff is very nice. Lots of food options,and drinks. Eclectic decor. Plus freshly squeezed OJ any time. A must when in San Francisco."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This place is very busy in the morning, so go early! By 10 in the morning, there's already a line outside the door. There are a lot of options and it was hard to make a decision :) But I had the Miami Heat, and it was delicious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,They have a huge selection of crepes and other food. It is all done really well. I love the cable car scramble it is my favorite thing. The coffee is really tasty as well
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Rolled up on a Sunday morning to a long line  out the door but the lady behind us said she'd been the day before and it was worth the wait--and it was! The line moved quickly, service was efficient and friendly, the portions were huge and delicious 😊 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We had found another place to try, but when they were out of several menu options we walked back down to Honey Honey.  No limits on their menu and everyrhing was delicious and served with a smile.  I especially enjoyed their herbal tea selection and the blintz was expertly prepared. A great find!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,We were group of 5 and we ate twice in it during our trip with different orders each time everything was delicious. Line is long especially if you come late. Friendly staff Highly recommended
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Crab cake sandwich. Amazing. Dessert crepes were also excellent, wish they were open later than 3:00 but it is the perfect brunch spot!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Was entertaining guests here from out of town on 12/29/19 @ 8:30 am and the the food was excellent, the service was lackluster at best. The greeter was an ●●●● and we waited a week of sundays getting our food as a local I will not be returning wow!!! What a fail!!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast, looks busy but was able to find a seat easily after ordering. Worth making the stop for breakfast! Made our own omlete and tried the crepes."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice staff, nice food!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Lovely little cafe, quick service (even despite the line) and great food!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Waited so long to order and then at least half an hour for food. Then the side dish was wrong and I had to wait again. No apology, service was barely friendly. It's just such a waste of my time. Food tasted decent at least. I would not go back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I ordered the pesto crepe and it was absolutely incredible. The ingredients complemented each other very well and tasted very fresh. Would recommend for sure.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,My favour place for breakfast in SF. The breakfast is amazing specially egg omelet. The orange juice is really fresh.  The pancake is great also. I could go there everyday for breakfast
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Amazing place to have breakfast in San Fransisco to be able to walk for a long time their up and down streets. Not so expensive for the quantity and quality they offer you. I will repeat again when I come back to SFO.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very busy but I recommend arrived very early. Good food and I live the music.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good place for breakfast. If the line is to the door, you're looking at about a 20-25 min wait. Had the Croissant Sandwich and the Two, Two & Two. Both were really good and filling."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The chicken pesto crepe was pretty bland and the waffle was the plainest I've ever had in my life. BUT, I'm going to try to go back bc the crepe itseelf was perfectly cooked and I think with something different inside it would be incredible."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This is THE spot to go to for a delectable brunch in the city!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,It’s really good place !! I love it !
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I had the crab cake Florentine. It was blan and the crab cakes were burnt. The potatoes were good. I would give this place a 2.5 but I don't have that option. I would get the crab cake Florentine again. Maybe I should just get there crepes.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good for a hearty and no-fuss meal. Excellent quality, fast service, & decent prices."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The Chocolate Nutella Crepé was to die for!!! Being so close to the downtown area we managed to find this place fairly quick and my family loved it so much!!! Will be back very soon!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious! great menu options, friendly service"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Blant food, super expensive, super loud pop music, nice interior, but everything else is one star, my Milano ommlet supposed to have basil(seems like they have only one leave which they shred it to make looks like some basil), but I did not feel any taste of basil. I had to ask staff to pour hot tea for me, because teapot was broken and hot water pour all over the table, no paper napkins in room given except one together with fork. Staff are trying to be helpful but they are not friendly, understaffing is the obvious problem. Consider that I paid $20,35 for not tasty small size ommlett, burnt to black wheat bread, hot tea and 20 tips, I don't know how it's possible to have 4 stars rating for this place. The only plus is nice looking interior, nice name and nice looking attractive exterior.((("
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Not many breakfast options on a weekday in SF, but this place was worth the wait in line. Like everything in SF it was slightly higher price than it should have been, but the food was good!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Found this place through Yelp cause we're craving for something sweet after the strenuous shopping in downtown (on a Saturday evening). No food service at 9:30pm Saturday although door sign and Yelp indicate business hours up till 10:00pm. A group of patron was finishing up at that time. We walked in and immediately told, ""take out only (f*ckers)!"" So much service for a banana Nutella crepe which takes less than 10 minutes to make. Nasty rude European female cashier (with tee and long uncurbed hair) who kicked us out (with her death glare) the minute we walked in. There ain't no honey in this joint, just bitterness..."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very happy with this cafe.  So many really good sounding items to choose from I could not decide.  I did settle on a California sandwich and the chai tea was Soo good.  When I visited it was not as busy but service was fast and staff was pleasant. Very happy to have stopped here.  I will visit again if I can.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Excellent food and excellent customer service! Very busy Sunday morning, long line, but we were seated and eating breakfast less than 30 min after walking through the door"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Honey Honey Cafe delivers delightful simple breakfast and brunch. The extensive menu covers all the classics from eggs and Benedicts to French toast and crepes. I appreciate the fast service  and back to basics menu (refreshing in San Francisco).
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Took us about an hour to get thru the line to order, get our food, and eat. Not bad for 8am. I had the Chorizo scramble, it was pretty filling and tasty. I'd get it again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Waited 30 minutes in line to get our order in. After putting in our order, we waited another 20 minutes. We finally decided to get up to check on our food. Turns out the waiter had lost the number so didn't know where to bring our food. When we did get out food it was cold. We didn't get an apology or anything so I know I won't be going there again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"It wasn't apparent from the start, but this place is a nice little haven in an otherwise unfamiliar neighborhood. I ordered from the specials menu and enjoyed my meal with a glass of fresh-squeezed OJ. The city noise asserts itself from time to time, but it's an adventurous backdrop."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,It was a nice place! The girl behind the counter was nice and they had a big selection. I was happy with my chicken sandwich and the coffee was pretty good.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fantastic place to go for dessert. We had the crepes and it was delicious and for the price, pretty well portioned. Definitely would go back when we visit SF next time."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We make sure to eat here every time we're in SF. Love the food and location, and the service is great. The line to order might be long but it'll be worth it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very tasty fresh orange juice, cheddar cheese omelet was delicious as well as eggs benedict with salmon. Takes some time to stand in queue but the quality of food is very good and the price is right."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Like the idea of a crepe place in my neighborhood, disappointed with Honey Honey.  Sloppy service (idling instead of taking orders or busing tables, order mixup), and the food is overpriced (read: close enough to Union Square to charge a premium).  Fast and always oddly convenient, though!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Loved the place, good for breakfast, a bit overpriced for this type of food, but thats San Francisco 😜 There will be a line, waiting will take in average 5 minuets(thats the time you read the meneu), the food came 3-4 minuets after i ordered. …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Nice little corner restuarant, ample room with good self-seating area. Menu was huge with diverse offerings. Had the chix burritos , quite savory, wife had the nutella banana crepes which she loved. Semi-table service setup. No dedicated server, just staff floating around, bring food to table and clearing dishes."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Fast service. The huevos rancheros was sub pair, sloppy, and way to soup like. Very disappointed.  Crepe was adequate."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Looked at this online before we got into the city on vacation. So glad we stopped, the eggplant crepe was awesome! The line was long, that was the worst part, but the food came out quick once we ordered"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good food but they seem disorganised. They charged my card the wrong amount (the cashier noticed after he'd swiped the card noticed). When the food came, we didn't get quite what we ordered.  Note: long queues (30 min+) to get a table."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,It's not the most comfortable of settings to eat breakfast - the decor could do with a bit of a lift but the food is well worth the visit. Chorizo scramble was delicious and pancakes are good as well.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I got the SBK crepe and it was delicious! There was a small problem with my order but they were so fast to fix it and very apologetic. Everyone was super friendly and courteous.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,A great breakfast experience in SF financial District
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was okay. Got the crab cake Benedict and regular Benedict...it was luke warm and the potatoes were cold. Coffee though made fresh was only warm. Wouldn't go back or recommend.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food and friendly service.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious egg benedicts, nice environment. I especially like their wavy tables. My wife loved their hot cider with cinnamon. Oh, and I had to refill my cup of coffee - its good!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The bearded guy working the register was a total jerk.  This place was headed for 1 star until I had the Miami heat...by far the best crepe I've ever had.  The take service was good as well,  which redeemed it a bit more as well."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Don't be put off by the line. It moves surprisingly fast. Eggs Benedict / florentine and Potatoes were great. The Nutella crepe was delicious too (make sure to get it with their ice cream!)
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Great food. Good wifi & busy at weekends for breakfast. Staff are lovely & menu is extensive. If you don't like it here you're spoilt or there is something wrong with you.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"This has the look and feel of the local ""Hole in the wall"" eatery.  Walking distance from O'Farrell, this is a place frequented by the locals.  Food is fresh and cooked to order. The service was great and everyone was very intentive. Great place!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"tasty. In door spaces out seating. The tuna sandwich was delicious. The crepe my husband had was ""ok"". The spinach had stems."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Don’t know what the hype is about this place, but the food is just tasteless. Our eggs benedict where a big disappointment. The muffins were dry and over burned, there was barely any sauce and the potatoes were undercooked and chewy."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food. Coffee was solid. Fast service and fast table turn. Definitely would go back.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Nice little cafe in downtown. Loads of places to sit and a large menu.  I got the chorizo sandwich and oh my... I was blown away. So delicious.  They serve beer here as well. Worth checking out.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great breakfast as always. Three very cleaned plates when we were done! Eggs Benedict, Chorizo Scramble, and Chocolate Waffles all vanished in no time!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,If you don't mind standing in line the food is yummy. Is it worth there wait? Depends on how hungry you were when you got in line I suppose.  I had the Belgian Waffles and a Chai with no complaints.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food is very good and the service is great. The only thing missing is more options for morning dessert menu.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. This really feels like the Denny's of Crepe places. Very lackluster and not super high quality ingredients.  Just go to Crêpevine instead where you get twice as much food that is way better for the same price."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"They publish they are open until 10 pm.  I showed up at 9:31, and they wouldn't take my order.  The person in front of me got there just ahead of me and they took their order.  And its not like there were 50 people behind me either. Disappointing. They should update their hours to reflect when you can *acquire* food, not when you can eat it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Saw lot of tables with food left over.. kinda off putting. Can't blame the service, there were only 2 of them there looking after the whole store. Crepe was average.. Chai Latte was average."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Great place, we couldn't even eat all we ordered. Very delicious. Friendly Staff including Ukrainian Girl. It was worth waiting 30 mins to order. Thanks from Polish tourists"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Super duper busy, but we were able to get a table somehow! Good service and amazing food; I recommend the Belgian waffle and their lattes!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,A delicious place for brunch in the city. You'll get the millennial vibe as you enjoy brunch with snapchatters and instagrammers getting those money shots of dishes that actually deserve a post. The eggs Florentine and huevos rancheros were cooked to perfection and the baklava crepe was a uniquely tasty treat.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Crab cake Florentino was very good.  It was worth the wait of at least 30 minutes.  The potatoes are excellent much better than traditional hash browns.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious and many options for a perfect breakfast
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"One of the best meals in San Fran. Busy, but the staff does a good job moving ppl through and making sure everyone has a table."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I got delicious breakfast here, reduced 1 star because the table and chair was not clean…"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very crowed place but seems to be a hip location. A broad menu (breakfast, lunch, snacks...) offers nice food for sb's liking. In the morning (weekend) very much people, so we waited 30 min to order our breakfast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Just what I expected, great crepes! Expect to pay a little over $10. They offer more than just crepes, but I only had a dessert crepe. The place is much less popular at night. Take out is an option."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I usually like to find a place close to the hotel on Sunday’s and with this spot being a couple blocks away with a variety of healthy options for me I couldn’t resist a “repeat performance” and I didn’t have to have to same thing twice! Mimosa’s on deck as well and they’re always on point 🥳 …
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very good breakfast! Long line out to door, but staff is very efficient and wait is not long. Definitely will eat there again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was delicious.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We had the salmon and crab Benedict’s, and a dessert crepe and it was all YUMMY!  When we arrived the line was to the door, but service was expedient, staff was helpful, friendly and fast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good for breakfast. Pankaces are tasty, cappuccino was good. Recommended."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Delicious!!! Amazing crepes. Great customer service, line moves fast if thier is a wait, but we'll worth it. Enjoyed the fruit infused water."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Birthday breakfast = crepe suzette.  Very tasty
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good food, but not worth the wait considering all the options around. It took almost 30 minutes just to order; and this was at 9:30 am before the town ""woke up"" as we were told."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"French toasts lacked some taste, but pancakes were good. Not the most friendly service, but they’re polite."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,A lot of breakfast options. They have savory and sweet crepes and look wonderful. Service is very efficient with some smart options like ordering before taking the table.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,My wife and I had breakfast and thankfully got there before the long line formed. The crepes were excellent.  So many choices. She had the breakfast crepe with potatoes and I had the sbk.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good food. Really nice cause we had our two kids with us and they were nice. We had a good meal and we really didn't have to worry about our kids being loud as the place is noisy. That helped us. Week be back.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really solid crepes with a variety of flavor offerings, with extremely ample fillings. It's a hefty breakfast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Worth the wait. The ""Half Moon Bay"" crabmeat stuffed mushroom crepe is delicious. Fresh orange and carrot juice plus bloody mary's too. Just go."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Menu has a good selection. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was good. I would recommend if you are ever in the area.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Really good sweet crepe, I got Nutella and strawberries and they offer either whip cream or ice cream. Friendly staff, free WiFi. A little pricey for a crepe but it's also the neighborhood. I would return!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Best fresh juice ever but food and coffee were very okay okay, would definitely go for the juice again and again but not for anything else"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The food is disgusting and the staff is really rude inside, very dirty, I definitely do not recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious food. Lots of people here for a Sunday lunch compared to empty places nearby. Good range of food from pancakes to burgers to huge salads. Very impressive
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Me and two others are currently having mouthgasms. I feel like I haven't tried a real crepe until now. Sex and food now make sense together. Our mouths and tummies are beyond satisfied. From mimosas to savory crepes to dessert. Omg
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I had an excellent Breakfast Crepe. The location is slightly small but I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and was still able to carry a conversation despite the hustle and bustle.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was so good! Eggs Benedict were perfect. Cinnamon french toast had just the perfect blend.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Line is out the door during brunch. This place has amazing food and small restaurant charm. If you can stand the wait, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic experience."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Very good crepes and coffee.  A very long line the day we went but was handled well. Our only complaint was that the music was too loud to talk.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"SBK crepe could use more sauce, it seemed a bit dry. The pesto chicken was delicious and you should definitely try their freshly squeezed orange juice !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"We are big fans.  There is something for everyone who loves breakfast.  The savory crepes are special.  There is often a line to get in, but the wait is worth it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very nice for having breakfast. Be aware with the potatoes. If you don't like the taste of Thymian with your potatoes you better maintain it. Nice place, nice service, good food. Prices are reasonable."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Our experience at Honey Honey Cafe was not very pleasant. Maybe we hit them at the wrong time but all I ordered was a burger and I couldn't even finish it. It was greasy and lacked flavor.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Tasty place for breakfast/brunch! We had a 45 min queue but at the end understood it worthed it since the food was really good! Recomment this place for a breakfast in San Francisco
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Not bad, it’s what you would expect out of a regular brunch place. Definitely go for the crepes as the specialty menu item, although the omelette wasn’t bad either."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Savory crepe uses regular sweet crepe instead of buckwheat. Was thick, doughy and oily. Also had eggs Benedict, eggs were slightly overcooked. Latte was weak."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was delicious.. home  made orange juice ! was really good and fresh! The waiting was about 30 min to an hour but it was worth it.  Anyways just keep an eye on the bathrooms 😔 .
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"While a bit loud at times, Honey Honey is an incredibly delicious crepe and sandwich experience.  Inexpensive but very well prepared food.   I would definitely eat here again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Crepe SBK was not good. The bananas were brown, and strawberries were soggy. The whip cream was delicious. On the other hand my husband’s dulce crepe was very good.  Their chai tea latte was good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Regular American breakfast/brunch kinda place. (Question: why do these places all have the same kind of menu art and fonts?) It was not the best but good and definitely not bad. 🤗 …
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good place to begin your afternoon. Inexpensive and not a whole bunch of atmosphere but good food.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Loud music detracts from the good food and conversation.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Took an visit here while in frisco and enjoyed it. I ordered the pecan pancakes with bananas, potatoes, some chorizo among other things. Definitely recommend to try"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food compensated for the other not so good things. It opened at 11am which it usually does not. And then there was water dripping from the ceiling in some parts. The food taste and quality was really good otherwise
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The wait was 45 minutes. The people weren't very nice. The food wasn't worth the cost or the wait. It came out too cold.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Good food and location. Only taxes and charges are not clearly declared on receipt. Whenever i pay by card, it only says „service charges“ on the receipt afterwards but i still pay like 10% extra even if i did not select any tipping"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Came here for breakfast as it seems to have a lot of good reviews. I got the breakfast crepe, which was nice but honestly was nothing spectacular. However, the price is great and it's certainly set me up for the day!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food is good. However, I found a hair inside my meal, disgusting. Since it was a take out order I just threw away the rest.... Almost done by then."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Food was good. Had an omelette.  Was there on a Saturday. Therefore the queue was long. With the time it grew till the entrance. Another star less because its very loud and echoeing.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Went on Saturday morning, it was quiet and relaxing. Had the eggplant crepes which were great. Washed down well with a nice mimosa"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Busy breakfast place, always seems to have a line."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The food was great but the place was kind of messy.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Naah not to my taste... i hv no idea how this place so good review. Food are pretty standard but expensive. I order pan cakes, it was so dry.. there is a spoon fool of cream they served. I mean a teaspoon. I'dnt go there..."

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good spot for breakfast or brunch with decent food options and prices. It is also a fine place to come with kids as long as you avoid the popular weekend times when the line can be out the door.

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Ate here twice while visiting San Francisco on holidays and was pleased with the variety of menu options. The queue sometimes spills out the door so expect a wait to be served.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Nice place !The food was delicious and the size of servings were great. I would highly recommend everything about this place. Homemade and plenty of options.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Small and popular corner breakfast oriented  restaurant. The staff will find you a table while you wait in line to order. There are a lot of options to choose from for drinks and food, most of them geared towards breakfast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Very good crepe, omelette and overall breakfast place which is extremely busy but moves the crowd efficiently so that one is not in line long to order at the counter and be subsequently served at the table."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Unpretentious diner with a huge selection of sweet and savory crepes and breakfasts. Low service, casual atmosphere. Order at the counter and your food comes out at lightning speed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The line moved smoothly and service of the waffles was fast. You can't really go wrong with waffles, but they were fruity and not overly sweet, and excellent for breakfast."

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Hidden gem of a small cafe. Quick service, good food. Somewhat typical creperie-style fare plus sandwiches, but it's simple food done well."

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"If you are going on the weekend be prepared for a long line. Nevertheless, the food is great and the staff works really fast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,The tables weren't clean and the place wasn't organized either.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I was walking by this place and a little homeless lady asked me if I'd buy her a cup of coffee. Why not? I asked her what she wanted and then went in. At first, they told me that they didn't have what she wanted - a caramel latte - but apparently I just had to ask for it the ""right way"". It was almost like the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld, if I didn't ask for exactly the right thing the way that they wanted then they were going to throw me out. It was an odd, surreal experience. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. I think they even charged me an extra $1 because I know tax isn't 30%."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"I came here expecting great crepes, I was very disappointed.  Thick and tasteless."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Had to wait almost an hour. The menu is huge, plenty of choice. The staff work really hard to keep up and are very polite and helpfull in explain the choices and making recommendations. Highly recommended"

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food was OK, good service, but the place is not clean, restrooms are gross, one of our plates was super old looking dirty, even one cup still had lipstick on it. Disgusting."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Came here with my brother and we both loved the food! The Belgian waffles are great
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Precooked eggs, barely heated raw vegetables, some diced sandwich meat, stuffed in a thick doughy crepe.  upon raising concerns I was told 'it depends on the cook'.  Yuck."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Good place to have breakfast. You line up and order.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Delicious! We had the eggs benedict and crab cake Florentine and they were amazing. A bit pricey for breakfast - but the food was definitely worth it.

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,I ordered banana chocolate crepe and it was delicious! Pancakes and coffee was good too! Def my fav breakfast spot in the area.

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Long wait. Food could be ok, but got some one hair and in the dish. Prices are a bit high for what you get. There are better places in town."

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing buttermilk pancakes, beautiful fresh orange"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Miami HEAT! This savory crêpe had an amazing Cuban spicy sauce which needed no Tabasco enhancement, even for this spicy food lover. The soft chicken was well balanced by avocado and scallions, and the crêpe itself did its job well. Rest of the meal was good but nothing to write home about: OJ was ok, wife's pancakes were ok, chicken sausage was quite good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"The creeps were delicious! Great for breakfast, awesome for lunch. Dozens of choices. Reasonable prices. Best breakfast place I tried."

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Food was fantastic, however removed one star for how inefficient the process to get a table is. Waited in line for 45 minutes to get to place my order and then get seated even though there were many tables available."

Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,"Amazing food - particularly the breakfasts, huge portions and they have fresh squeezed orange juice available 😍, all in a relaxed atmosphere. …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,This place looked good when I walked in. But as I sat down I seen the lady cleaning the coffee stand and dropped the honey cap. SHE looked around and just put it back on the honey as if nothing from the dusty floor is going to stick to the honey that I just used🤢 …
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,Omg the food and service was amazing order the egg benedic bagley 2 cups of amazing coffee. And every thing was delicious
