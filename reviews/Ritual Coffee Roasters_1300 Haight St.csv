Réveille Coffee Co.,"01/08/2023  Went there around 10am! Ordered iced coffee, Mocha ☕️, avocado toast, and breakfast muffin.  Our order came in a few minutes 4-7 minutes even though it was crowded!  Everything was soooo delicious and yummy!  For the ice coffee, I wish they had creamers like vanilla or caramel instead of only half-n-half. But still was good 👍🏻  Overall, it was good experience and highly recommend it if you like to sit by the window and see the life out there ❣️"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I normally don’t get food at coffeeshops since often they reheat a pre-made sandwich, but this place has an actual kitchen and makes everything to order. Great spot in north beach for a more “modern” coffeeshop.  The house made hot sauce is awesome too, make sure to ask for it with your breakfast 🙏🏽"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Cappuccino is amazing! We are visiting this place almost every day! Also, avocado toast is just from different planet! Amazing!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great, warm, and fast service. Small but mighty menu. I loved the breakfast sandwich!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,A cute little coffee at the corner. They have nice coffee and nice interior design that matches the area vibe. Great place to have a coffee break while walking around with friends.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Found this coffee joint on google and let me tell you it was amazing. Sitting here waiting for my food felt like I was in Europe so many foreigners come and go. This is why I love SF cause of the hippie culture and European tourists. I ordered a platter potatoes, eggs, bacon and sourdough toast. It was just the perfect amount and the coffee was delicious. Great staff and their cook is a beast. The home made green salsa is crack! Recommend."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Their matcha latte is 🎯 airy and well-lit with windowed-walls, great for feeling a part of the neighborhood while enjoying a cafe vibe. …"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"amazing coffee, food, location, service.  their avocado toast w a poached egg is exceptional.  and breakfast sandwiches are out of control 🔥 good seating options outside and in."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Delicious food and tasty coffee but unfortunately everything was served in plastic/disposable containers. Seems weird in this day and age when we know the impacts of plastic waste and disposable coffee cups, and also made it harder to eat because the plastic fork kept breaking!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,I really enjoyed the modern and clean atmosphere and friendly service but my latte and flat white were a bit weak and could be hotter. Unisex restroom through the back requires a code.
Réveille Coffee Co.,We came here for snacks but somehow the shelf was almost empty but 2 pieces of bread which was a disappointment. Had a mocha ☕️ but wasn’t that great. The location was great. Better luck next time?
Réveille Coffee Co.,"No disrespect to all the shops that carry coffee near Chinatown.  Didn't want watered down coffee nor milk tea.  Went to Chinatown to get some food and was planning on getting some coffee in the Mission.  Forgot that there was this coffee shop on Columbus St. Parking was difficult.  Went in and ordered my Sunday usual- 1 espresso, 1 coffee, and 1 latte.  Very cool shop shaped like a triangle.  Modern and clean.  Cute blue tables outside that would be perfect to enjoy on a warmer day and people watch.  Large windows and seats by thr window inside. They also offer some breakfast items but I don't usually eat breakfast!  Good coffee and reasonable prices.  Will definitely be back when it's safe to dine in again!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Little coffee place with good breakfast options, their bread was so good, it has a layer of cheese in it, crunchy on the outside and soft inside, french onion soup was good but not as warm enough. Overall good."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Very nice staff. I had a lovely americano with steamed milk. They also have a nice selection of pastries. I had a chocolate chip cookie that was great. I think they make them with brown butter and/or mix chocolate shavings into the dough.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great food, healthy options and a kick-ass avocado toast. We tried the Shakshuka, yogurt, eggs & bacon and the avocado toast with friend egg. Prices match the nice food. Great ambiance and right next to Chinatown. The staff is friendly. Their coffee and tea is really good and we would come back and definitely recommend to friends."
Réveille Coffee Co.,We went because they have gluten free options. Apparently they have several locations in the Bay Area. Many people frequented this coffee shop every day we went there. Their coffee options are good and they have many breakfast options.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"One year ago I stayed in SF for a week and got avocado toasts in here every day during my stay. However, they changed recipe since then.. avocado toast has way less avocado and weird sauce on top… I had terrible stomach ache after eating it.. haven’t had this issue 1 year ago! Something has changed and I am very sad not to call this place a must-go location in SF anymore"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great little modern corner Coffee House in the heart of San Francisco.  The cup sizes are perfect. Not to small like some of my visits to France and not to big like most American Cafes. While visiting I stoped for a cup of Soy Mocha and a healthy dose of Avocado toast. It is so nice to see more cafes carrying healthy options, so Cudos for the toast it was tasty.  There are a nice amount of windows in the cafe and some outside seating for all the sun you can handle. The decor simple and modern with wonderful staff. Great place to take a break from the rush if your in the City."
Réveille Coffee Co.,One of the best coffee in the area. Cappuccino is always awesome! Very much recommended.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Went here for the cute drawings on the lattes I had seen on other reviews, however, I don't know if they have a new barista, but my latte came plain...the beverage was okay, but nothing remarkable. I was expecting more as a coffee lover. The pastries seemed to be from the day before, it was 9am and they didn't look fresh. The almond croissant that I had was really good tho, despite not being freshly baked. Maybe it wasn't the right time to visit, due to covid adjustments. The toilet is not open, so have that in mind."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Loved the breakfast sandwich (with the “works”). Tasty pastries from The Midwife and the Baker, and superior latte art."
Réveille Coffee Co.,This rostery / coffee houses has just the best tasting coffee and they can prepare it right. Can’t recommend enough!
Réveille Coffee Co.,"We had a great time when visited Reveille for breakfast. We found delicious pastry, breakfast sandwiches, and great coffee there. The view from inside and outside was stunning."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Fantastic breakfast sandwich with what I believe was like noodle kugel instead of egg… SO tasty. Coffee very good as well.
Réveille Coffee Co.,Really nice coffee with great coffee. Both the flat white and expresso were really good
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Proper barista, coffee light shade bold chestnut taste ... my favorite cortado/gibraltar is yummy.  Wifi and restroom with code available.  Limited sloped (not flat) outside seatings available about 5 tables 2 seats each, happy turquoise color.  Inside seating along the windows, mostly singleton professionals with laptop.  Across Station Cafe across the street, another great coffee place with fab breakfast!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Good coffee, unfriendly service. The cafe is worth a visit for the interior alone, nestled into the point of a classic SF building. It is a great spot for studying/work since it is primarily bar style seating- but no plug ins. You shouldn’t expect friendly service however, the hipster baristas are too cool for a smile or quick small talk."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"After becoming frustrated at City Lights bookstore we decided to get a drink and were amazed. Great service, clean building and wonderful coffee!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Bored at work, at home or in school? Grab your laptop and spend your day here! Make yourself comfortable either inside where the modern interior and unique architecture fulfills the cafe with daylight or outside where you can charge some vitamin D while getting your work done.  In case you’ll get thirsty for strong and good coffee or hungry for a healthy lunch - no worries, they got you covered! Wi-Fi is available.  So what are you waiting for? Go and check it out! 😉"
Réveille Coffee Co.,I’ve come by a few times to get coffee/tea for myself and coworkers and every time it’s been a wonderful experience. The ambiance is inviting and the employees are really friendly.
Réveille Coffee Co.,Great coffee and their pineapple danish is heaven.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Rude cashier. Gave me a smirk and she looked away; didn't say anything when I said thank you. Is a 10% tip too little? She might just be having a bad day but when the customer behind me tipped $2 or 3 for a cup of coffee, she lit up and said thank you loudly and was smiling.  They left my drink on the counter without saying anything. Didn't realize until they called out the customer behind me. What's going on with the cashier and barista there?"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Awesome experience here. Great latte and super patient barista working on his own today with no help. Even with that, he was amazing and made a very delicious drink for me!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Really nice coffee shop!! Only point of improvement would be the take-out boxes you get even when eating inside.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The sticky bun was quite good and crunchy caramelized. I ordered a cortado which is a strong drink with little milk. It was good. The other pastries were interesting, but the breakfast sandwich was just right."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I came for a pour over, but got drip instead. Wasn't disappointed. Came back 3 more times during my stay in SF.  My wife enjoyed her latte as well. Simple the way it should be."
Réveille Coffee Co.,The coffee here was delicious. The food was so healthy and filling! Loved it.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Make sure you arrive well before they close. They don't take any last-minute orders. Blue Bottle is on the next block and open later if this happens, so all is not lost in your caffeine journey."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"A long line on Saturday morning waiting to get delicious breakfast. Food taste good, and  relatively cheap. Not enough space but you can definitely fit in. In summary the food here taste great"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great vibe and great location. Found it online and went in due to the reviews. It was clearly a hot spot with plenty of virtual workers.  Frankly, I was left with much to be desired with my cappuccino, as well as my wife and her latte. Our coffees were both really watery. I don't know if they had a new barista or someone who likes muddy water, but I ended up chucking my coffee 1/3 of the way in. Wish I had gone somewhere else. :("
Réveille Coffee Co.,In love with this cheese and avocado toast!! And cappuccino is great here too. Highly recommend
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I used to like this place but once they changed the menu the quality of food has gone down significantly.  My partner and I ordered açaí bowl, kale salad, and breakfast sandwich which got us food poisoning.  Coffee is still okay but avoid food items."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Coffee was really good and I love the vibe. I ordered the home style breakfast and it came in a to go box that was pretty hard to eat out of considering it was runny eggs and crusty toast. The potatoes were a let down so if you’re a weirdo like me and get excited when you get breakfast potatoes - don’t get your hopes up. You could taste these had been reheated.
Réveille Coffee Co.,Such a cute cozy spot! Loved the pear tart. The yellow vanilla custard was so lovely.
Réveille Coffee Co.,Cleans s modern coffee place. My Almond milk latte was delicious. Minimalistic decor.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Definately not the best coffee I have ever had.  Ordered a mocha, my mistress a latte. Both not amazing like everyone says so. Will continue to explore the coffee scene. The almond pastry they have is amazing though."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Avocado toast was good, but the bread was hard as a rock. Sad because the rest tasted great, but the bread cutting into your gums kinda takes away from it 🙁 …"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The only good thing about this place is probably the location. Otherwise, the coffee is very light tasting, I thought I ordered a glass milk. The toast is brick-hard and almost broke my teeth, and potatoes are colorful in appearance but bland as dust. If you are looking for flavor, turn left to Chinatown."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I didn’t have coffee (wish I had), but I did have a chocolate croissant.  It was good."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Had breakfast here today. The atmosphere is pleasant, in the morning the sun shone very nicely into the café. I had an avocado sandwich, which was super fresh and delicious. I had a side salad with it, but the dressing was very sour (lemon) and unfortunately oversalted. That can happen. Otherwise, the coffee was really fine with oat milk and also the service was friendly. So if you are looking for a healthy and freshly prepared breakfast option, you will find it here!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Amazing avocado and toast! :)
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Loved that a dirty chai - a small quirky outlet at the triangle square in North Beach area. Opens up early, ok-ish crowded. Please try."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Decent food, not much atmosphere.  Outside dining, good coffee!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Good coffee. Great avo toast. Nice vibe and clean.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Ordered a pourover and the barista left a ton of room in my mug. Looked over and realized he had put the remainder of the coffee from the kalita wave into a paper cup and was drinking it himself. Only cafe I have ever gone to where for $6 they don't give you the full pourover pot to refill into your mug. Coffee had a good acidity, but unfortunately the flavor notes did not poke through as the water used was too hot and the barista didn't allow the coffee to bloom. Nice atmosphere and friendly service, though I still cannot believe the barista drank part of my order! I usually don't leave bad reviews but wow."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Oh we had no idea what we were doing. We looked up coffee and the reviews were nice so we stopped by. Coffee? Really good and beautifully made. Breakfast sandwiches? Awesome. Now we know what we’re doing and will come back. ☕️🤩 …
Réveille Coffee Co.,This was such a great place to get breakfast. I just loved the atmosphere and if you get there early enough then you can beat the line.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"We stayed for five nights in San Francisco and found this Café on our first morning. The cappuccino is brilliant and the mocca is delicious. The food is brilliant, too. The sandwiches are made with great bread. The breakfast here really made my day while we were in San Francisco."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The staff are lovely, I must have a delicious dirty chai with oat milk when in the area, they always pull 2 shots 😻☺️ …"
Réveille Coffee Co.,A nicely decorated cafe with good food and coffee. The tomato based breakfast stew (terrible description) in my picture was fantastic and definitely the best menu choice.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Had a smooth, silky, delicious vanilla latte and an almond croissant. The croissant was fresh and airy. Awesome little coffee co."
Réveille Coffee Co.,We came for a quick ☕️.  I will try their Cafe au Lait next time
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Really good place for a brunch. The food was really good (and vegetarian friendly), same for the beverage (not too much sugar in the Chai latte for once) . The staff is really nice."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Really great coffee shop in North Beach. Amazing coffee, great food, and plenty of seating."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Not environmentally friendly.  You are forced to drink from a PAPER cup, while sitting in the place.  Coffee is super acidic.  Not recommended!!!  Also, slow and they have no idea what a macchiato is, unless it’s a tiny over milked latte, not!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Happened upon this place while visiting from out of town.  Ordered a regular latte with oat milk. Presentation was great, coffee was extremely tasty. It was so good I came back the next day and bought a bag of their coffee to take home. The breakfast sandwiches are also good - egg and bacon or egg and kale available for grab and go. The atmosphere is also very nice and clean.  Super friendly and accommodating staff.  Will definitely return the next time I'm in SF."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I love coffee and seeking out new places, especially when visiting a new city, so when I came here one morning to pick up an iced coffee and chocolate croissant, I was not disappointed! It has a modern interior and the coffee was great, so I had to go back again! The barista, Tommy, was awesome and we chatted, along with a few other customers and employees, about traveling and different experiences, so it’s a great place to meet new people and socialize!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Really good coffee. But the competition in the area is REALLY stiff. The location and the space itself is spectacular, but again, LOTS of stiff competition in the area.  The almond croissant tasted okay but wasn’t texturally satisfying enough (very little crispy/flakiness) to be worth getting again."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Nice interior but they serve coffee only into takeaway cups. Coffee didn't have very fruity flavour. I was bit dissaponted.
Réveille Coffee Co.,This place has good wifi and plug points. I really like the coffee here and the avocado sandwich is pretty bomb.
Réveille Coffee Co.,Nice coffee shop and friendly staff. However it will be better if their coffee is stronger than this .
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Definately not the best coffee I have ever had.  Ordered a mocha, my mistress a latte. Both not amazing like everyone says so. Will continue to explore the coffee scene."
Réveille Coffee Co.,One of my favorite places in San Francisco. Very cozy place with nice music good breakfasts and  coffee. It's also great for an afternoon coffee
Réveille Coffee Co.,Probably the best cappuccino in Bay Area. Reminded of seattle :)
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Stumbled upon this modern coffee shop; nicely presented, delicious food and good, strong espresso."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"It’s a great third wave, hip coffee shop… they have food which I haven’t tried, but it’s popular so I imagine it’s good. You can only have one local spot, this is more my feeling fancy jam."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"My favourite Cafe of all time! Super nice staff, great coffee and a good place to get some work done. It's most of the time quite well visited but there are plenty of seats and almost every seat has a socket outlets so you can charge your laptop. Free and very fast WIFI! The food looks fancy and tastes delicious, it is fairly pricey though but worth it.  I come here all the time and I love it!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Excellent. The place is beautiful, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Espresso is 👌 …"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Beans taste burnt. Place looks good but the coffee is a major disappointment. I'd advise blue bottle over this place and even then I'm not a major blue bottle fan.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I love the coffee here; I've never gotten the food, but I'll have to stop by for some breakfast soon. The lattes are delicious and I'm a sucker for the latte art :)  Great, friendly service with a good number of counter seats (2-3 tables only). It's a good spot to grab your coffee to go or hunker down with a book/laptop and your coffee!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Super friendly staff and great coffee! Its also a really good place to work as they have super fast WiFi.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"After getting lured into the ball of grossness that is Brioche next door, i happened to mistakenly walk into Reveille and have the authentically delicious pastry and coffee i was looking for.amazing staff and amazing pastries..will be back for breakfast proper!!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Okay, for customer service price and taste it's okay. Nothing mind blowing, nice atmosphere and a good selection of coffee options."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great little coffee shop just outside Chinatown. I only had time to stop for a quick Americano. It was delicious. The food in the case looked amazing, but again I was in a rush. The staff was very friendly. The vibe was ""downtown SF chic"" but not too hip if you're concerned about not fitting in. I will definitely make it a stop again next time I'm in San Francisco."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Really busy hip cafe. The food was decent. But the staff couldn't care less. The cashier was so aloof and unfriendly. There was zero customer service because why bother when they have a line up out the door. It's a shame because my egg sandwich and latte were pretty good. Not worth lining up for.
Réveille Coffee Co.,As good as it gets for a local coffee shop. Quality coffee and very decent eats.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"This coffee is amazing! Great service and wonderful options, good prices too—I came in super late and had a ripped $5 bill, I felt super bad! Nonetheless, the barista was so kind and made a wonderful drink."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Great oat cappuccino and avocado toast. Lovely service.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Probably the best coffee we had in our 2 month road trip around the States. Very tasty food. Modest portions, but that was actually a relief given how huge most servings were on the road. Quality not quantity! Definitely recommend Réveille..."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Awesome place to grab a coffee or matcha. Atmosphere is great. Highly recommended.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Nice staff, decent coffee & food. Open & bright environment. The food from the kitchen can get too strong it obscures the coffee's aroma."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Very Nice.  A great place for a coffee and breakfast.  I ordered a pastry that I was disappointed it was not made at the shop, but it was very good and I must say they pick their suppliers (from Oakland I was told) very well.  Coffee was great and the egg breakfasts I saw come off looked great.  A very nice room in North Beach and would definitely recommend for breakfast."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I found Reveille to be a bit pricey, even for San Francisco, but you can't argue with the quality - the coffee and tea (and food!) are on point ;). This Reveille is located on a busy intersection in North Beach, so it's such a transformation to walk inside into the warm, cozy (and sometimes quiet, but sometimes loud-ish and busy) environment... Or you can feel free to take your treats outside to hang out in their outdoor seating section, just off the main street and perfect for people watching on sunny days. The staff are friendly and helpful and can give suggestions if you're stuck. Great experience(s) here and already looking forward to my next visit :)"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Oh my goodness! Sooo delicious. This place is the bee’s knees. They made me an iced vanilla latte with almond milk that was so delicious and creamy that it tasted like real milk. Service was great. The atmosphere is so clean and full of natural light. Definitely a new favorite!
Réveille Coffee Co.,To the coffee here is trash. That being said it's a cool place.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"This place was not good. My friend and I came to try out this place for a casual breakfast and coffee. What we got was mediocre food and bad coffee. We got their breakfast plate which consisted of two average eggs, overcooked brittle bacon, some normal toast, and, actually, some very good potatoes. So if you want to spend $15 on breakfast and then only want to eat potatoes then go here. The espresso was also very, very bitter. Nothing else came through. To sum it up, I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great place to work/study, but they do play loud music. All drinks and food are good but can also be pretty pricey.  Overall, I've always had a great customer experience and all the employees are attentive, engaging and responsive to my questions."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"It was a spur of the moment call to stop here but I'm glad we did. We got 2 cappuccinos - one with whole milk and one with almond milk. Everything was great, except the drinks could have been a bit warmer. The whole place is cute though, and a great spot for people watching."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Good spot for a coffee and avocado toast. Chai is only ok. No indoor seating at the time of this post but there's a parklet and a couple of two-seater tables available -- metal seats so best bundle up if it's a cloudy day.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Can't speak for coffee, but the black tea they use is tasteless, and was definitely not earl grey... Also cream is not the same as milk. Please do better! Location and seating were fine and service was pleasant."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Their coffee's great. I've had lattes, drip, pourovers, and cold brew, which have all been a coffee snob's dream. The fancy toast is a little overboard for me. But the space is cute and relatively well arranged. The only bad thing is when the sun's shining in, the place can heat up like a greenhouse!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Fantastic coffee, great location, friendly staff, chill atmosphere. Loved it all!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Really cool coffee spot in a nice part of town. The staff were friendly and the coffee and food were really good. Not the most overpriced (also not the cheapest), but it really feels like you get something for it. High quality coffee and foods!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great coffee, friendly service and nice minimalistic decor — a wonderful place."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"NB's coffee options are NOT GREAT. The third wave didn't seem to have arrived here yet, NB and coffee... it's kinda stuck in time.  Réveille to the rescue! First of all - location. On the corner of Kearny and Broadway, with tons of natural light. The store design is kept bright which adds on the welcoming and clean ambiance.  I always enjoyed their coffee - I'm more of a pour-over drinker, and their choices don't disappoint. You'll pay your $3-$4 per cup but hey, third wave.  Worth it."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"If you like coffee stay away, americano is literally water with a touch of coffee, asked for a croissant, they served it cold. They only make coffee and sell croissants. There are better places out there"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"After searching hi and low for a good flat white, Reveille didn't disappoint. Great coffee! Their food is also impressive. Simple but tasty. Definitely worth a visit when in SF!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Decent coffee, but the best reason to stop of here is because they filmed Star Trek 4 outside. Geek alert!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Nice coffee place with okay coffee. Coffees were wonderfully done just alot of acidity for an espresso
Réveille Coffee Co.,"New favorite spot near downtown / North Beach.  Everything you need to park and be productive.  Great wifi, good seating with a nice window line and handy plugs.  Brilliantly executed coffee drinks - the basics, not the frappissimo junk they peddle at Starbucks.  Excellent sandwiches.  It's a limited menu, but the kind of place that does what they do *very* well, and a real haven in an otherwise barren and mediocre section of San Francisco.  Oh, and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Thanks!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Really nice coffee shop. The coffee was good, not the best but still good. There’s a nice sitting area outside with tables and benches. Very cute neighborhood. Kinda hard with parking though so just be prepared."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I was a bit disappointed with dirty tables (and table configuration). My place was with crumbs, and something sweet poured on the table. Only two ""normal tables"", the rest is a bar table around the room, where people ""blocks"" multiple places with their stuff. But I'm not sure if the area could be solved in a better way... Coffee was good!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"A charming, corner coffee shop! I got the $4 iced coffee and it was fantastic. The space has good indoor and outdoor seating. I am totally making a note to bring my laptop back and work from here sometime."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Cons: average coffee (Blue Bottle it ain't), no public restroom, stifling hot interior.  Pros: buzzy location, the outdoor seating along Kearny street provides for a good perch from which to view the urban beauty that is SF."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Love Réveille. Situated on Jackson Square, this coffee shop and cafe has floor to ceiling windows, letting in lovely light and even better views of one of SF’s most picturesque neighborhoods. I always get matcha with almond milk. It’s sublime, smooth, lightly sweetened, and the perfect temperature. The staff is quirky and engaging, and stopping by after a day at work is an awesome way to start my evening. Highly recommend to anyone in the area."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The coffee cafe/bakery I like is BRIOCHE, just a bit down @210 Columbus Ave. This casual spot, with sidewalk tables service, does a killer breakfast that straddles 7am till about 3pm.  Omletes, Easyover eggs, scrambles.. they make almost any breakfast dish you request, for just a $1 custom item charge. Since BRIOCHE is also a bakery there's a array of delicious, fresh pastry. Chocolate chip cookies in several varieties. Try the raspberry-filled croissant type crescent, fresh dusted w/the perfect amount of powdered sugar.  Prices are very reasonable...and you can grab your baseball cap + shades, pop into this easy-going spot and be incognito."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Young inexperienced cashier/baristas that have no customer service experience, could be better. They like keeping their back towards you."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Last time I visited here I really liked it. Cool space with decent coffee. I came back now and the staffs are “too busy” chit chatting and not brewing coffee. It took exactly 9 min to get a cup of pour over. Other drinks might be okay, but PLEASE DON’T GET THE POUR OVER. Not worth the money and time"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Cool place, but.... Coffee is weak. Not worth $3 for a mug. Tastes like diner coffee. Food was pretty good though. Food is served on a flat piece of slate. Seems cool until egg runs off the edge and makes a mess.  I guess that's why they invented plates with lips back in the bronze age."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Not great coffee at all, much better options in the city. One staff member was very polite, while the other was really grumpy. Telling me off for using the cream that's right by where they give you your coffee, because that's ""staff use"". Pretty stupid having it right by where you're given your coffee then."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Quality coffee in an iconic spot in the city. Very cozy inside and such a vibe overall. Wish there was more seating though, service could be better too. My favorite drink is the Matcha Latte."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"It's a little bit pricey, but really great!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"8.8oz bags of coffee?? Common guys, this is out of hand.  Yes shrinkflation is a thing but this won't even get us through the week. Sell the same 12oz bags as everyone else even if you're charging $24"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Reveille Coffee is a local coffee shop so popular it has several locations. This particular location is in between Chinatown and Telegraph Hill on a beautiful corner of the city.  The coffee shop itself is well designed so get your phones out to snap a photo for Instagram. They have a variety of pastries for breakfast. I recommend the banana bread. It's perfectly dense.  The baristas are a little snobby here, but they do make a good latte.  There's seating inside around the walls, in the back, and there's outdoor seating along the street.  I recommend grabbing your coffee to go and walking up Kearny Street to Telegraph Hill for beautiful views of the skyline."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Really good coffee. The baristas do an excellent job ensuring quality with each coffee. Don’t go here if you are in a rush though. There is often a wait and no one is rushing to get orders filled.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"San Francisco has a lot of great coffee options, and this place should be one you try. It's a small space so there are not a lot of seating options, especially if you're with a group, but the coffee is very flavorful. They have a limited food menu and kitchen, which I think is unnecessary given the small space and lack of seating."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"This is my favorite coffee shop in the city, and I've taken it upon myself to test as many as possible!  Skilled baristas will take care of you.  The espresso is topnotch. double ristretto pull.  value for you money.  The baked goods are out of this world.  You won't be disappointed."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Amazing meal. Absolutely delicious.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"One of my favorite coffee places in San Francisco. Great coffee, places to seat with your laptop inside or outside, healthy breakfast options and snacks. The best part, when it is warm outside you can enjoy the fantastic view on San Francisco at the outside seating."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Interior is pleasing to the eye and there's plenty of bench seating along the walls. Without a queue, it took about 20 minutes at 3pm on a weekday, to get an iced latte and espresso to-go. It appears seeking perfection is a value at Réveille Coffee Co."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The coffee is fine, but hardly worth going out of your way for. The location is truly great, the folks working there are nice enough, an amazing bathroom by San Francisco standards, but a great parkette just outside the doors makes it all worth your while."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Signature latte is so good here. Are you sure you didn’t add cream? Love they order the flower arrangement as well, good to see some fresh flowers for starting our day."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Good smooth and rich cappuccino. Only problem, wish they served coffee in ceramic cip."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Reveille Coffee shop also serves delicious, savory fare at a great price. Be sure to come hungry. Here, you'll see a very stylish clientele of paralegals and professionals from the offices surrounding this corner of Pacific and Columbus avenues."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"It's nice, great rock and roll music, the coffee is good (almond latte) and the banana bread was ok (either a dry recipe or yesterday's product). Will revisit if in the area, but likely won't go out of my way."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Good expresso and I loved the almond croissant!
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Love the coffee, including their matcha and chai lattes. And the food is also incredible, I had 2 delicious vegetarian meals here!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Great breakfast over here
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The coffee is excellent, hands down. Awesome place to meet up and hang out. Try to be there in the morning for their breakfast which is phenomenal, particularly the one that comes with an egg in a hole in a bread."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Everyone there made me feel really welcomed and thanked me for coming back, which was a super kind gesture. Awesome coffee and food!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Coffee was subpar and the service kinda sucks. My half and half kept curdling when I added it to the coffee - this generally means the half and half is old and/or the coffee is too acidic. When I showed them that it was curdling the woman working there kept acting like it was my fault and I was intentionally curdling it or ""doing something wrong."" Super weird and off-putting. Blaming the customer should probably be not your first response to carrying old half and half that curdles when you add it. In a city that has amazing coffee everywhere, it's surprising this place is still around."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Not sure in what world it is OK to charge extra for iced coffee that is literally just the pre-brewed coffee poured over ice, meaning you just get watered-down lukewarm coffee for more money. Lattes are fine (if spendy), but honestly this place is a bit overhyped: usually crowded and takes a while to get anything."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"This is a good coffee spot, with good atmosphere."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"It was 20 mins to their closing and I asked to get my coffee not to be in a paper cup, the server said okay but they put the coffee in a paper cup and they didn't tell me that. I understand that washing dishes before closing is hard, but I wanted to drink my coffee fast to give them enough time to wash the cup."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The slow (upwards of 6 min) pour-over is really really good. I would describe it as tasting like wine, with layered subtle flavors. The only problem with that description is that I had a cup of the ethiopia wato at reveille the other day, and then 2 hours later i had a glass of wine that tasted like sour dirt in comparison. The wine wasn't bad wine, the coffee is that good."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Jus decent coffe with a small number of options for pastries. The location and the atmosphere are good and justify the visit. Nothing is especial about this place. The service is average. Parking is complicated as everywhere else in the area.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Just ordered a vanilla latte and an americano with vanilla. Lady let shots sit for over 30 seconds after they were poured. ""Killed shot"" still served us the coffee. Tasted like absolute garbage. Threw away and went across the street to the station"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I really liked this spot. Had a very good sandwich a.k.a. 'brunch-burger', while chilling outside, enjoying the busy crossroad from my table. Also, served on a funny platter, an eye for detail!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"My espresso cup was cold, so my espresso went cold after three minutes. They can not do this basic things right. The pretty writress was talking with a clint for ten minutes and ignored me who standing there, I had to cut in rudely to make my order. The waitress was very unprofessional even she was pretty. If she wanted to find a date or bond a closer relationship with her clint, please do that after her work."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Whenever I need a break from work, I come here and pick up a latte. The also have lunch wraps and salads. I highly recommend the kale Cesar salad. I wish it had a little bit more of protein, tasted great though!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Coffee, toast, pastries and matcha latte were all delicious."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Nice decor. Coffee so so.  The baristas are extremely ignorant about coffee. For example, they don't know anything about Kalita, the brand name of the equipment they use. They thought it was a cheesy Spanish word. Unbelievable!  To owner: please hire some educated baristas."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Nice spot, seating is limited. Coffee is great and the breakfast option s are different and delicious. I had the toast and avocado with fried egg."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Had an espresso that was too bitter to drink. When i asked the barista if this was normal for them he drank out of my cup and said it was abnormally bitter. He didnt offer to make me a new one or refund my money. So, i just walked out in disbelief. Very bad experience. Will not return."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. period. so great. I could go on, but it would just be me repeating myself about how damn bomb the sandwich was. do yourself a favor and eat one."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Want the most SF-like vibe in North Beach? This is the place. The impeccable interior makes me feel like I'm in Tokyo, with some of the best coffee (Four Barrel) in town, served by the chillest baristas ever."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Came in here for an ice coffee. Liked it, was refreshing. Coffee shop looked pretty happening. I noticed it felt pretty hot inside. Maybe no AC. If you're in the area looking for coffee and a place to hang, this is a good option."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Best coffee in San fran hands down. From Sydney and have been searching for good coffee. Food is excellent. Good service. Came back from Sonoma just for the coffee!
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Good coffee in cool triangle building on the edge of China town, north beach, and financial district."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Great place to work from - very sunny and bright and the coffee was fantastic. The avocado toast was decent - not the best I've had, but enough to get you by."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Note: This rating is for the new Castro location on 18th Street, which hasn't yet been added to Google+ Local. Opening day activities were executed flawlessly, with adequate staff, attentive service, well above average food and warm beverages. The lattes, which are not a bit acidic, are priced comparatively to Philz across the street.(Note: Reveille charges $0.50 extra for soy and almond milk  - Philz does not.) The goat cheese salad is a steal at $7.50. It's generously sized and includes a large, browned slice of goat cheese to smear on the included flatbread."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Lovely breakfast and friendly staff. Well priced for their quality and service. Latte was amazing, ready to start the day now!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Cool coffee shop with decent seating. A bit pricey, and the selection of teas is lackluster. Their espresso is very good though, will return"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Avocado/prosciutto toast is of good quality but coffee is super bland.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Stopped in for a latte and avocado toast before a big Saturday shopping day. It was fast, easy, and delicious. I'll be back next time I'm in the area."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Lovely cafe with outdoor seating. Coffee is great. They have breakfast/lunch menu with pastries and sandwiches options.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Training a new barista during rush hour is not idea (10min wait). Also, when the trainer hands you a cold coffee, you wonder how good the coffee made by the trainee will be."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Dry potatoes, dry tomato, cold poached eggs. Service was unfriendly. But the bacon and the toast was good. Not worth it for 13 dollars though."
Réveille Coffee Co.,I didn’t really like their coffee. I could be really attached to styles like peets but it was also 50% more for a cup than the chains.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Excellent place for breakfast. I came two days consecutive. Coffee and food is amazing, the staff is super friendly"
Réveille Coffee Co.,Best coffee ever. Creamy and NOT at all bitter. I had a soy latte and my girlfriend had a regular skimmed milk latte. Perfect :)
Réveille Coffee Co.,"This place is delicious.  They have almond milk for my latte, and incredible almond croissants.  I love this place - and plenty of seating, too!"

Réveille Coffee Co.,"Nice design and concept. There is a large sunny terrace outside. The food quality is not very high, but the prices are actually quite high."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Nice place, nice coffe and PERFECT FOOD. I had to go back several times to try different edibles and all of them were an +A."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"I took their hot chocolate, and it was one of the worst one I have had in a while. It was very bland and cold."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Breathe of fresh air to find cafe's like Reveille!  The La Marzocco was again a perfect guide to finding great coffee, friendly people, and good food."

Réveille Coffee Co.,Great coffee and breakfast. Very friendly staff. Slight delay in the breakfast so they provided another excellent coffee on-the-house.
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Amazing pour over coffee here. Smooth fruity note, soft caramel sweetness, and sophisticated coffee aroma make my visit here a wonder experience."
Réveille Coffee Co.,The egg sandwich with Bacon was not a really great sandwich. There was too much stuffs and no taste except pepper.  The place and staff are really nice though
Réveille Coffee Co.,Add in an extra tax without letting customers know. Just include your healthcare cost in your price like all your other expenses . Otherwise its dishonest
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Healthy kale, quinoa, avocado, etc. Didn’t have the coffee. The tap water was really good."
Réveille Coffee Co.,The food was excellent and reasonably priced. We had two of their salads and a sandwich and it was all delicious. There's also outside seating.

Réveille Coffee Co.,"Good coffee for an Aussie's standards.. and anyone who knows us knows we have high standards when it comes to coffee ;) Good atmosphere, friendly staff AND good music played 👍🏼 …"
Réveille Coffee Co.,We stopped for a quick coffee on a rainy day.  The service was dreadful and the coffee was average.  It was definitely style over substance.

Réveille Coffee Co.,"Visited May 6, 2023 After lunch, I was looking for a cafe, and I was drawn to this cafe after seeing a higher review than the nearby Blue Bottle and photos with a hip atmosphere.  You can order cafe and simple brunch meals. As soon as you enter the entrance, you will be greeted by 2-3 coffee-makers, and in the back, there is a kitchenette where you can make brunch. There are not many seats. There were so many people that there were only a few seats left. It would be good to refer to.  The coffee was very strong, so I personally liked it. I ordered a warm latte, and the latte art was pretty and full. Cookies, muffins, and simple breads are also sold. I can't remember the name of the bread, but the outside was sweet and crispy, so it went well with coffee. However, be careful as the bread is a bit sticky. The bathroom here is also locked with a password, so it is managed more than normal. However, my husband can't drink coffee, so we ordered hot chocolate. The art was really pretty, but the taste was bland, which was a little disappointing. But if you like coffee, I recommend you to visit this place."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Good cappuccino, good matcha in a very nice location. The possibilities to sit on the street round off the café perfectly. Absolute recommendation for SF!"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"A good brunch shop. If you visit in the morning, you can drink a cup of coffee comfortably while feeling the busy streets with people going to work. Coffee is also very good. Maybe because of the atmosphere, I personally enjoyed it more than Blue Bottle."
Réveille Coffee Co.,"Good location, very popular. The coffee very rich. A bit noisy for the amount of people."
Réveille Coffee Co.,👍❤️☕️ …
Réveille Coffee Co.,It's the same chain but with a smaller menu than the local one in Mission Bay. It has less space inside but more hours of sun on the terrace. The machine coffee is very good but I don't like the drip at all. I miss the acai bowls and some options on the menu. The service is friendly and the neighborhood is very nice.
Réveille Coffee Co.,The vegan avocado toast and the oat milk latte are excellent! It is not to stay very long on the spot but the time to swallow your bite the setting is very pleasant! Good place to start a day of urban exploration when you don't want to take too long to eat in the morning.  Good for vegans and those who love their classic latte!  PS: the staff is dog friendly and those who came to take their coffee to go with petou had success :)
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The food is boiled. Cold and tasteless. They waited a long time. The cashiers don't know what they're doing in the kitchen. Yes, and the coffee was not made correctly, altered, made cold. Uzhaaas. I do not advise anyone"
Réveille Coffee Co.,"The cafe is ok. It's possible to sit outside, the tables wobble a bit, but that's more because they are on the street and uphill. Of course there are also cakes and cookies, not a large selection, but okay. There is also a toilet, you need a code for this, which you have to ask for at the cash desk."
Réveille Coffee Co.,Good for a simple breakfast.
Réveille Coffee Co.,San Fran Local Famous Coffee Shop! Highly recommended! Especially the latte or cappuccino is delicious.
