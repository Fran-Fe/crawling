Fresh Brew Coffee,Great service and a wonderful menu selection. I was very comfortable in this cozy quinta space. The employees were very helpful and made my experience the best one since I was in San Francisco. It's on a block lined with trees and no homeless people around to spoil your eating experience 😉. The service is amazing. You're giving a number after you pay and place your order. There's sitting outside and inside. It is small but cozy and the food is amazing. Price are inexpensive 😄😄😄. I love this place and recommend it if you're in the union district or willing to travel 🧳.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Been going here frequently for over a year and this is an establishment that you’ll feel great about supporting! The owners are so friendly, and really add to the neighborhood with their coffee shop and amazing Banh Mi sandwiches.  Everything is very fairly priced, the banh mi’s come with the best toasted bread I’ve ever had with these type of sandwiches (only around $8 too)! They have all day breakfast as well, and lots of coffee options.  These types of bodega style shops are rare outside of the east coast, so SF is very lucky to have this local hidden gem. I Love the bacon avocado Banh Mi the most 🥓. Stop by and see for yourself! 🥪"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Amazing price and food. It is very cozy and relaxing you forgot you were in San Francisco. Best customer service. In and outside sitting. A bit small but very welcoming 😊.
Fresh Brew Coffee,This little hole in the wall has some excellent Vietnamese style sandwiches. Took awhile but its freshly made. Cash only.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This place was great. Very small and not too many tables to sit at but the food was delicious. very friendly staff. Got the turkey and veggie breakfast sandwich. Ingredients were fresh, took a few minutes to make it, but I'm happy to wait for fresh and delicious food. Vietnamese coffee was really good, nice kick in the morning to start your day. Highly recommend, inexpensive. They even let me order before they were officially open."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Been here 2 days in a row on my vacation and will probably stop once more before we leave. The owners are so nice and attentive! Such great Vietnamese coffee (9/10) and their bagels (8.5/10), I know basic, but are so delicious. As someone who goes to Dunkin' for their bagels, FBC’s cream cheese and bagel itself, are very good and way better than Dunkin’s! Their pastries (8/10) are good too and sandwiches (8/10) are delish! Definitely recommend.  *They take cash (preferred), Venmo and CCs!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Excellent breakfast sandwich and cappuccino.  Very busy which is always a good sign.  Small location and only a few tables and chairs but it's breakfast that can be ate while walking down the street.  Friendly service.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Best bahn mi I’ve ever had. Balanced flavors, the bread is perfection. Crispy but not hard or chewy. Breakfast sausage was on point. Vietnamese coffee wasn’t too sweet or too bitter, just perfect. We paid under $20 for the sandwiches and coffee"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Walked here from the Fairmont during our last stay for breakfast sandwiches and smoothies. Great food. Much better than what Fairmont had to offer for breakfast. We liked it so much, we ended up going back for lunch. The owner was really kind. My wife forgot to ask that her latte be made decaf, and he re-made it for her. It’s not fancy stuff, but it was just what we wanted. Hot, fresh, good quality, excellent service. This place earns its high start rating."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Worst Vietnamese iced coffee. Very water down. Not sweet, no strong. Disappointed for Asian ran shop. Their sandwiches looks great! Didn’t get a chance to try."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Top 3 Viet sandwich I’ve had all time! Family that runs it are so sweet! My go to when I’m in the area now!
Fresh Brew Coffee,They have a great American style sausage egg n cheese bfast sandwich that is perfect for quick tasty fuel.  But someone recommend me the combo; now this is all I get. Say yes to the jalapeños.  The prices you cannot beat. Love these guys.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"One of the better banh mi I’ve had outside of Vietnam. Baguette was crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and served warm. The filling was solid, and you could taste a good amount of pate and vinegar from the pickles. Will def be back"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"EXCELLENT spot!! Extremely inexpensive for quality food. I can’t speak to the bagels (we’re from NJ so we don’t get bagels in other states) but the breakfast platters, hash browns, bacon, coffee, and espresso were amazing. There’s seating if you want to eat in. Very nice people working there and a lot of locals who you can tell love frequenting this place."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Nice little place with an asiatic charme and great original cambodian Sandwiches (Banh Mi) but also American breakfast items. Cappuccino is great and nice conversation about Cambodian travels, experiences."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Very very nice latte which is best I try in SF. Fresh and so delicious snadwitches!!!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This mom & pop coffee shop is the spot to go to for a quick bite.  Been coming for at least 7 year before the pandemic and their quality hasn't changed since.  They did upgrade the inside so it looks a lot nicer.  The couple that runs this spot are so sweet. I highly recommend you coming here if you're in the area.  Today I had their chicken & Avocado viet sandwich with extra Jalepeno, with a chai Latte with oat milk!  Probably the best chai latte I've had to date.  Come you won't regret it."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Avocado bacon,my favourite one! Great place to eat breakfast"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Went there every morning for my last stay in San Francisco. The Vietnamese sandwiches are really tasty. The coffee isn't the greatest but gets the job done. The Avocado Báhn Mì is AMAZING! And it's really affordable aswell.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"We woke up craving Vietnamese iced coffee so we found this hole in the wall coffee shop and it was a great choice! Super friendly service and delicious banh mi (among other things!)—probably the best banh mi I’ve had, ever, and that’s saying a lot! The French bread is warmed up and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside 😋 The Vietnamese iced coffee is very good also. Very small with 3 small tables inside and two tables outside. Looks like a small family owned business, definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"I absolutely adore this mom and pop shop! When I used to live in the neighborhood (while being tight on budget) it’d be my weekend ritual to go there and get a freshly made bahnmi as a treat! Compared with other “hip” bahnmi place in SF, FBC’s bahnmi has simple ingredient and toasted-just-right baguette — which makes it really tastes like home 🥰 (for this reason, it’s my favorite Bahnmi place in town).  Most importantly, the owners are super nice and attentive! Always with a big warm smile.  I still make sure to stop by whenever I am in the area not only because the food is good but also because it is the type of local business that I would like to support💕."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Came here for mochas and was pleasantly surprised. It is quite small and looks family owned. Menu was quite extensive including various coffees including vietnamese ice coffee, lattes, boba, baked goods, and banh mi. There little tables for seating indoors and out front. It was roughly $4 for a medium mocha, watched as they made it with generously scoops of ghirardelli chocolate with milk foam on top. Great spot to do a bit of people watching. Was quite busy when I went as there were people dining in - which is always a good sign."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great service, delicious food, and cheap!! It is cash only but you pay less than $20 to feed two hungry munchers. My favorite is combo pork banh mi. Chicken meatball banh mi is also delicious. Their breakfast sandwiches are good too but banh mi is the way to go."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Cute Vietnamese coffee shop. Solid takeout variety. Try grabbing a bite and sitting to eat in Union Square a few blocks away.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"What a hidden gem! Their banh mi is definitely top tier.  The vibe of the cafe feels like visiting a family friend’s house, lively and lovely. Highly recommend to stop by whenever you are in the neighborhood :)"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"$20 for a ham egg & cheese, a meatball & avocado bahn mi, can of soda, and large chai latte. Sandwiches were sooooo good. Bread was super fresh and filling was great. Friendly staff in a cute little place with 3 tables inside."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Really great breakfast items. Loved the breakfast sandwich. My wife thought the coffee was very good.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Probably the best breakfast bagel I’ve ever had. Chewy, toasty bagel with super fresh just cooked eggs, runny but not messy, tons of cheddar and a seasoned and salty sausage patty. Please go to this little establishment!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,One of the best Bánh mì in da world! I ordered the pork combo instead of other breakfast sandwich in the early morning! And IT'S SO GOOD! The bread is so crispy. The meat and veggie taste so rich! I love it!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Best breakfast in the city. Eric is a delight and always remembers our order.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Went there before heading out to Alcatraz, Chai latte was very flavorful and my wife love their white mocha latte, cheese Danish was magnific."
Fresh Brew Coffee,The best BBQ chicken Bahn mi I’ve had in a long time. Fresh bread and super tasty. Sausage and egg bagel was also delicious
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great coffee and sandwiches. 😍 I especially enjoyed the crunchy bread 😋. …
Fresh Brew Coffee,We had delicious and affordable breakfast sandwiches and coffee as well as a fun conversation with some regulars here. Highly recommend it!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Amazing little breakfast place! Great prices, wonderful food. Biggest bang for your buck I’ve had in a while."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Absolutely awesome Bahn Mi sandwiches. The staff is very friendly and immediately made us feel welcomed. I highly recommend the bacon avocado Bahn mi with egg for breakfast!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great food. Fast preparation speed. Mango smoothie is really good. Nice choice for grab and go breakfast.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Visited from Toronto & stayed in union square. BEST BREAKFAST PLACE EVER. & only affordable place in the area. Food is fresh and tasty. Service is great. Recommend the croissant with egg and cheese + the strawberry and banana smoothie … We ate there every day. Perfect place to fuel up in the morning before touring the city. Also has cute but limited seating so you can get an authentic feel of SanFran culture.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Cozy little cafe with great coffee, sandwiches and Bagels. In love with the Vietnamese iced coffee!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Best banh mi I’ve ever had. Family owned, veggie friendly. Tasty, worth every bite. Will be going again."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"The sweetest family runs this small breakfast and sandwich shop. The owners are so friendly and energetic and make really great banh mi. I get the combo with extra veggies and it's so filling that I split it between breakfast and lunch. They're open during shelter in place, and just updated their hours so they're closed on both Sunday and Monday now."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Amazing little caffe!!! Great Vietnamese sandwiches, smoothies and coffee and pastries!! Pastries run out since they only have enough to have fresh every morning!!!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,The highlight of my trip to San Francisco was stumbling across this lovely place - a very reasonably priced spot run by lovely people.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"I ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee and combo banh mi on a Sunday afternoon. A few folks were standing around outside waiting for their food. Most people took their stuff to go but I snagged one of the two small tables out front. The coffee wasn’t as sweet or creamy as I prefer but the sandwich really blew me away. The bread was warm and fresh—just crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The sandwich fillings were tasty, generous, and in perfect proportion (though I could have done with a touch more pate). I’ll definitely be back to try more!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Reasonable prices, good service, strong caffee, the food is good but I had better. 4.7 stars"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Good Latte , using credit card need 50 cent fee . But still kinda cheap ."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"If you care about having fresh coffee, come here! Bagels were also really nice"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Stopped in here a couple times while I was staying nearby, simple quality breakfast fare and decent coffee, served with a smile.  What more can you ask for?"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Best Vietnamese sandwich in the city . I usually order the BBQ pork with jalapeño and extra cilantro
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great breakfast sandwiches. Nice people. Highly recommend. Not expensive at all.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Best breakfast bagel! Had the bacon, egg and cheese with avocado on a sesame bagel. Highly recommend for anyone visiting or locals in the area 😃"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great cup of coffee, vietnamese style. So definitely has a good kick to it. Enjoy!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Very casual family business with yummy sandwiches. I love their banh mi and highly recommend you to try it. The owner is super friendly and happily customized my order. Prices are cheap for the quality. They have many drinks which I like to try.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Small hole in the wall, family owned sandwich shop. Best bahn mi. Get combo. No doubt its worth the walk up."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"It's crazy how cheap banh mis are here for how good they are. Combination pork + pate (no cilantro 😎) is my go-to for lunch here, and the green tea boba is the best they have in my opinion."
Fresh Brew Coffee,I'm new to this neighborhood and Fresh Brew Coffee Cafe quickly became my go to spot for breakfast. Coffee drinks are on point and I've liked everything I've tried from the food menu. Friendly staff and reasonably priced. I highly recommend.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great coffee, food, and service!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great place...good food at reasonable prices. Had the combo and coffee.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Vietnamese iced coffee was nice and strong, not too sweet. Banh mi was okay, bread-to-filling ratio was a little heavy tho tbh and BBQ pork didn’t have a ton of BBQ flavor"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Love this place, the people who run it are so nice, the service is always really quick even though it's always busy.  Love the bacon egg and cheese breakfast croissant sandwich."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Strong coffee but lacking finesse in taste. Good muffins and very friendly people.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Bagels and coffee are awesome! Affordable prices!
Fresh Brew Coffee,I am visiting SF for a week and discovered this place. I will probably be going here for my breakfast everyday. Loved their chicken sandwich and everything bagel with cream cheese and avocado and mocha. So friendly and professional family is running the business. Stop by and say hi!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great food, great prices, and great customer service. I eat here several times a month and it's always delicious."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Best BBQ Chicken Banh Mi in the world. Looking forward to next visit. This place is definitely on my revisit list of Top 10 things to go for in SFO. Greetings from Munich
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great food, coffee, smoothies and boba! Fresh ingredients and you can tell it's made fresh to order. But what really stands out about this place is the happiness the owners put out, especially the gentleman who seems to be usually at the register helping customers. I was only in SF for two days with my partner and we went here for our breakfast both mornings and next time we are in the city you bet we will be returning. The world needs more people like him. He gave me and my partner a happy start to our day. The owner's smile and happiness is contagious. I couldn't recommend this place enough. Even if you just want a coffee and are in the area, try the Vietnamese coffee, it's delicious! You won't regret it because it tastes so good and you won't have a nicer experience in any other cafe or sandwich shop around."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Very good Balles at a reasonable price!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Such a wonderful place. You can just feel the love from the owner and the people who work there. The sandwiches are unbelievably fresh and incredibly delicious. My go to is the BBQ Chicken or Chicken Meatball with pate and avocado added. I can’t help but go at least a couple of times a week. The beat part is the reasonable and inexpensive price for what you get. I’m totally grateful for such a great place and great family run business right around the corner!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Sleeper bahn mi, one of the best I’ve had, legit contender for best in the city. Combo was amazing— perfect ratios, warm bread. Tried a bite of the bbq pork and it was bomb as well."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Delicious vege Banh Mi. Could have used more sauce but falafel and baguette very good. Pickled veges quite sweet but delicious nonetheless. Overall a good experience.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Amazing coffee and the best sandwiches in the city!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Love this place. Fast, friendly, attentive service, delicious, well-made food and drinks, clean and cozy environment. Perfect little neighborhood stop for your breakfast or lunch, with delicious banh mi to boot!! Lovely family owned business that makes this corner of Bush and Taylor feel like home."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Such a charming mom and pop sandwich shop! They make delicious sandwiches with fresh ingredients, and their Bahn Mi is second to none. Be sure to stop by!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,My favorite place to grab coffee and a sandwich before work. Their Falafel and Vegetable Bahn Mi is amazing!  The people who run it are also very friendly. Stopping here always brightens up my morning.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Was staying at a hotel nearby and found this place on a whim for a quick breakfast. Solid coffee and breakfast sandwich combo for under $10. The owner is sooo friendly - clearly loves what he does + his staff. Please support this local joint!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Best banh mi in sf! Such fresh bread!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Admittedly, the convenience factor for me is quite high, given that it's on my street, but I absolutely love this small shop. I'm not even a coffee drinker, so I'll stick to my sandwiches -- their breakfast bagel sandwiches have been a huge part of my weekend routine...if I woke up early enough during the week, I suspect I'd eat them even more. Run by such a sweet, respectful family. It doesn't look like they need this review, as they're often busy when I'm there, but just wanted to say thanks! Sincerely, Sesame, bacon, egg, no cheese, and avocado."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Tiny little café with great sandwiches and smoothies at an unbeatable price. The tuna melt was awesome.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great place to get banh mi at an affordable price... they also offer breakfast sandwiches. They tend to be quite busy in the morning and around lunch time. The location is pretty small and can only fit 3 tables of approx. 2 person each but the owners are extremely friendly and nice.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great place and friendly service. Vietnamese sandwiches are some of the best I've tried in the city and the American sandwiches are good too. Personally I get the Club all the time. Breakfast sandwiches are on point and the coffee hits the spot. Also go for the fruit smoothies. I'm a frequent customer - great place.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Bopped in from a nearby hotel for coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Great coffee and an AWESOME breakfast sandwich at a fantastic price! We will come back. Also, they were VERY efficient. I was in and out with a fresh made sandwich in less than 5."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Delicious bahn mi. I got the BBQ pork and it was great bread, meat and veggies. Also got a mocha frappe which was phenomenal."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Get a cup of coffee in two minutes  nice place cool customer s and cool employees
Fresh Brew Coffee,One of the best breakfast sandwiches we've ever had and a great pork sandwich.  Went back several times during our trip to the City.  Of all the food we had on this trip this might be the most memorable and that is saying something.  This place is definitely a gem.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great little find tucked away. Solid coffee and some of the best breakfast and Vietnamese sandwiches. Went multiple times when in town.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great Vietnamese sandwiches! Space is VERY limited and lines occasionally get long, but it's always been worth it. My recommendation is the Super Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"a lower nob hill family owned staple for breakfast or lunch- their banh mi is delicious and notably different than other banh mi in the area. Crunchier and lighter bread than spots like Saigon Sandwich (which is also great), but the banh mi here is crispy and saucy and delicious. Their bacon egg and cheese is also great and a very fair price!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Super friendly owners and affordable prices.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great Vietnamese sandwiches and great service. No nonsense, clean place. Cash is preferred but they accept cc’s also for 50 cents extra. 5 stars"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Owners are always friendly! This is the most value for money deli in the area. I've tried around and haven't found anything better. Bahn mi, vietnamese coffee, smoothies are all good."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Loved this little cafe! The owner, Jacky, was extremely friendly and really made sure every customer was satisfied with the food. I had the breakfast sandwich with egg, avocado, and tomato, and potatoes on the side - so yummy!! Coffee and bah mi were great too. Price is very cheap for the neighborhood. The breakfast combo was around $6 and portion was generous.  You know it's a good place when you keep hearing Jacky greet his many regulars while dining there.  Definitely go visit Fresh Brew Coffee for breakfast/lunch when you are in the area!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This place is why small business needs to continue to exist.  This mom and pop place was absolutely amazing, EXTREMELY friendly, they remember who you are, what you ordered, they had people orders ready before they arrived to order.  So I ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich with a cheese bagel and they gave me an everything bagel, the next day I ordered the same thing AND SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE GAVE ME THE WRONG THING THE DAY BEFORE!!!! Who does that?!?! These are the type of people that deserve success in life, if you want a delicious cup of coffee made to order the way you want and tasty breakfast sandwiches, please patron this place.  The world needs more people like these!!!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This place is my favorite cafe local cafe. They're the earliest place open near me, and they keep a loyal crowd of regulars. All menu items simple and you consistently get exactly what you order, with great, high quality ingredients. What I love most about this place though is the customer service. After coming here, you can't help but start your day off happy af. The man and woman that work every morning I have ever come here are a tag-team of unicorns. They secretly make your food and drinks with love and happiness that we have all been missing this entire year. I'm not going to lie, I woke up sad and dragged my feet over to Fresh Brew to fill myself with caffeine, yet I left feeling like I just hugged a giant, fluffy teddy bear. This place needs an award for for civic duty, for keeping the neighborhood alive and for having a lasting impact on everyone who enters. They're a gd neighborhood treasure."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Absolutely the best spot in SF for breakfast/lunch. Friendly and helpful staff, amazing sandwiches and perfect iced coffee."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This place plays host to some of the best banh mi sandwiches in SF.  Cheap, authentic, and delicious.  If you're in a rush you can call ahead for the order too.  I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken and the BBQ Pork, while the paté is probably the most authentic to what I've had in Vietnam.  The shop itself is unassuming and simple, in the best kinds of way.  With decorations from the shop owners young daughter it adds a great feeling of them welcoming you into their home and making everything for you.  I can't recommend this place enough!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This is my husband's and my go-to place for a quick breakfast or lunch. Finally a place where the food isn't SF expensive or some overrated tourist trap restaurant or in a sketchy area! It's just an easy going hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in Nob Hill that serves great Banh Mi sandwiches (you must try one!!), breakfast sandwiches, and boba drinks that are all delicious. You can get a sandwich for less than $7 which by SF standards is super inexpensive. It is also a family-owned restaurant and they are so friendly to us and everyone they serve. There are certainly perks to living so close to this place. We highly recommend this place to anyone!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"I've walked by this place countless times, but only recently stepped inside. The sandwiches were freakin' amazing. We tried the chicken meatball banh mi, the combination pork banh mi, and a toasted breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, and turkey on an everything bagel. The owner was super friendly as well. Also, everything was super affordable--I don't think anything on the menu was over $8."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Breakfast sandwich was good and fair pricing. Coffee was ok. Nice place.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Went here every morning of our trip and loved it!!!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Stopped here while on vacation for breakfast and this place did not disappoint! I actually came here like three times because their bagels sandwiches and iced coffee was that good!! I will miss them dearly once I depart San Francisco!
Fresh Brew Coffee,This place is unassuming and a true hidden gem. The owners are super friendly and half the reason I come here. The banh mi is delicious and cheap (I highly recommend the bbq chicken) and I’ve come more often than I’d like to admit
Fresh Brew Coffee,I visit my brother who lives on Bush Street. And I have been coming to this breakfast/sandwich place every time I visit. It is run by a family and they are very sweet. They care about their regulars and personally make delicious food.  I love coming here because I always come in hungry and walk out full and happy grinning ear to ear.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Vietnamese coffee and sausage/egg/cheese bagel were delicious! I want to try the banh mi next.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Came here with my coworker and we split a couple banh mis. They were pretty good and also affordable. The bread was nice and crispy and the filling for the meatball one was very tasty. The owner is really friendly and goes out of his way to make everyone feel welcome.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This is a hole in the wall--don't think I actually saw a sign with the name of the eatery on it.  Breakfast was outstanding, hot & fresh.  While breakfast is not very Vietnamese, the lunch menu sounds great.  Jackie, I assume the owner, was very friendly and helpful.  Inexpensive too, for San Francisco."
Fresh Brew Coffee,I came here because a co-worker raved about their banh-mi sandwiches. I remember coming here a while back from time to time because of their donuts and coffee never realizing that they even made really great sammies & breakfast items. Will definitely return! Really affordable prices too!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Simple but amazing breakfast sandwiches. I get the bacon egg and cheese on everything breakfast sandwich a couple times a month. Bahn Mi is also delicious. The owne and employees work super hard and make sure you have a good experience.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Possibly my favorite banh mi ever. I got the BBQ chicken. The veggie falafel was strange but I liked that too. Super kind service, and a sweet little place in general. A real gem!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"I had a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on an English muffin. I thought it was very good.  The coffee is awesome"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"One of the best bahn mis I've ever had in my life. The service here is super friendly and the person running the place is so courteous and generous! I feel seen as a person when he interacts with me. HAH. Super dramatic, but the food was THAT good to make me like him so much. The BBQ Pork was tender and just super flavorful. The bread was crispy, but not so crispy that it hurt my mouth. Amazing. I wish I would have lived right next door!!! I would eat this all day everyday. The viet ice coffee is also amazingly strong. Gets me so hyped!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,My favorite breakfast place in the world. Period. Amazing breakfast sandwiches. The family that runs this place is a gem of Nob Hill. Definitely recommend.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Good food, good coffee and friendly service."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Hard to tell from the pics but banh mi were small - skimpy on the meat as well. Friendly service, though. Location was right for our stay at The Fairmont - beware: steep hill down Mason St!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Absolutely great.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Amazing family owned business!!! Always super friendly, super yummy food, and fast service! Im an art major and it’s always nice to see the little girl be drawing there and she’s super friendly! Must visit!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,I had a great Vietnamese iced coffee. The sandwiches looked good too. The prices are rather low and the place feels very local.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Came here for a lunch.  We enjoyed the lunch offering here.   Loved the fast, efficient preparation and interesting selection of offerings.  They tasted great and would recommend coming here for the food.  Unfortunately, the coffee and tea offerings are nothing special."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Fantastic fare and customer service. We stayed at the Scarlet Huntington up the hill and had breakfast here for each morning of our stay. I strongly recommend their food, particularly the bacon avacado with jalepeno."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"I just love this tiny cozy neighborhood place where you can get a great American breakfast sandwich consisting of Bacon or Sausage, Egg & Cheddar Cheese on a Cheese or Everything Bagel for instance. Van ""The Boss"" as she's called makes a Delicious Vietnamese Sandwich or Bánh mì consisting of BBQ Pork or Chicken/meatball or a Combination on a warm toasted French roll stuffed full of Pickled carrots, radishes, cilantro & Jalapeños (if you dare). The Avocado Smoothie is creamy & delicious & makes for a quick satisfying snack. Seth will make you feel right at home with his gregarious personality. He even doesn't mind when i hijack ""Alexa"" & make her play ""Baby Shark"", it just makes my day."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"This place is AMAZING! Not only the food & coffee, but the people. Grab a Vietnamese iced coffee and a sandwich, and for free you get to meet and joke with the finest family around. Awesome artwork by ""Iris"" as well. I truly look forward to weekends so I can go to this place. I think you will, too."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Good service. Excellent and crunchy bahn mi, although I didn't like the pork from the Pork Paté sandwich. Seemed like a processed meat, and was expecting something different. But well, for the price I paid it was fine, anyway."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Super friendly and upbeat staff. Seems to be a neighborhood spot with lots of returning visitors. Coffee and breakfast sandwich were great and served fast, desire being made fresh. Great start to a morning!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,If I could give them an extra star I would. The bacon avocado bahn mi was made from scratch with fresh ingredients. The chai latte had just the right amount of sweetness and milk. It looks to be a family owned and run store. The front of the counter is covered in adorable drawings by the owners' daughter. Seated extremely limited.
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Best breakfast in San Francisco and the baristas (I'm assuming they are the owners, husband and wife) are extremely nice. Loved the veggie breakfast bagel. Coffee is excellent also."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Amazing Banh mi sandwiches I have ever had! Best place for cheap good food!
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Good, cheap bahn mi sandwiches. Bread is nice and crispy. Could have more meat, but the for the price it's a pretty outstanding value."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Used to live In Nob Hill and came here often. Swing by every time I’m in the neighborhood now and never disappoints! Unassuming corner store with great bahn mís, super friendly staff and good cup of coffee."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Small little mom n pop with amazing bahn mi sandwiches! The owners have such bubbly personalities and make it a point to chat and get to know their customers....
Fresh Brew Coffee,"One of my favorite places to eat in San Francisco. For about 10 dollars you can get one of the best Banh mi's and a iced coffee, a perfect lunch or late breakfast."
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Their Vietnamese sandwich is perfect! And Boba green tea is good, too!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,This is the third hair that I have pulled out from the sandwich.
Fresh Brew Coffee,sorry to hear that next time you come we free back to you . if you come let me know .
Fresh Brew Coffee,Smal place with decent prices (for San Francisco).
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Good. Not great. Very nice owner / employees ! Strong coffee (+++) but not much taste to it. Stop in for a decent, quick bite on your way somewhere....but not a place to brag to your friends about"
Fresh Brew Coffee,"I visited San Francisco for four months and this was a pleasant surprise! The owners are amazing, the food is great and the prices are fantastic. Honestly one of my favorite places in the city!"
Fresh Brew Coffee,Awesome little Viet cafe. Outdoor seating was great. The perfect size for what it is (small).
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Great street food Not 6 out of 5 But definitely very good Good price to quality ratio Fresh ingredients  Got bagel with egg, cheese, bacon, avocado... it was delicious As well as sandwich on wheat bread  Friendly and quick service  Cozy and good vibes place  Wish only that tables were wiped more often and thorough  Delicious boba tea, however when we took two of them, one was heavily diluted with ice:("
Fresh Brew Coffee,One of my favorite places for breakfast and brunch! Small but clean and cozy! Check the full menu here.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Great little family run coffee shop! Good breakfast & coffee options and the bahn-mi's look delicious as well.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Very well made at a reasonable price!
Fresh Brew Coffee,Literally my favorite coffee spot. I love the owners and they remember me every time and their Vietnamese coffee is great. Tbh they make my morning & I love them almost as much as I love beer
Fresh Brew Coffee,"Had a delicious croissant with bacon and eggs for breakfast and got to meet Iris, the owner. She is 4, cute as a button, and her art adorns the counter."
Fresh Brew Coffee,Wonder little cafe. Great Vietnamese iced coffee and tasty bahn mi and american style sandwiches. The owners are super friendly.
Fresh Brew Coffee,Tasty coffee and snacks with a fair price
