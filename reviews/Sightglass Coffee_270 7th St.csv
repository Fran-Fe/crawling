Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee, but the waiter at the register was not helpful at all. My coffee was cold last time, I asked it hotter. She was arrogant and told me that's how they do it as the water kettle can only boil the water to certain temperature (really!) without even considering a barista could have made a mistake, like using little older water. Anyways, coffee is good and different coffee options are available as pour over."
Sightglass Coffee,"3.5 stars. super cute industrial vibe, great for studying, and would come here to get some work done. personally the coffee was too sour/strong for me but my mom loved it. it was also pretty pricey and they don’t warm up pastries (mini chocolate croissant was disappointing) very clean bathrooms!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Lovely baristas, great environment to work at but no wifi i think. Has two floors, plenty of seating options. Great coffee! I had the everything croissant with cheese filling. Lovely. Definitely will go back."
Sightglass Coffee,"Immaculate vibes, great coffee. Whole place has a minimalistic rustic farmhouse feel. Coffee is freshly brewed all the time and taste great.  Good place for working/homework/chilling. But they don’t have Wi-Fi so be prepared to use your own hotspot if you need it."
Sightglass Coffee,The coffee is okay and the pastries are from neighbor bakehouse. Don’t think they bake anything in-house. Avo toasts aren’t available Monday-Thursday.  Def come here for the vibe more than anything else! Wish they had wifi though.
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass Coffee is truly a coffee lover's paradise. I visited this place with high expectations, and it did not disappoint. I ordered a latte, and the barista who made it was truly amazing. He was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about coffee. I could tell that he was passionate about what he does, and it showed in the quality of his work.  The latte itself was fantastic. The coffee was rich, smooth, and had a delicious nutty flavor that was perfectly balanced by the creamy milk. But what really made it stand out was the latte art. The barista made a special design, and it was truly a work of art. The attention to detail was incredible, and it was clear that he put a lot of care and thought into his craft.  The atmosphere of the cafe was also fantastic. It was cozy, comfortable, and had a great vibe that made me feel right at home. The interior was beautifully designed, with lots of natural light and warm wood accents that gave it a rustic feel. The seating was comfortable, and there was plenty of space to relax and enjoy your coffee.  Overall, I would highly recommend Sightglass Coffee to anyone who loves coffee. The baristas are friendly and talented, the coffee is top-notch, and the atmosphere is unbeatable. It's the perfect place to relax and unwind, and I can't wait to go back again soon."
Sightglass Coffee,"Open Café which is incorporated in their own coffee roastery. You can sit and enjoy your coffee on the upper floor while looking at the cafe and the working roastery. The architecture is very open in inviting. Found this place by chance, worth the stop! You can also get cookies and little pastries besides your coffee. Coffee is on the pricy side though even for San Francisco."
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent service…very kind and patient staff…and wonder espresso. Was told by many espresso enthusiasts that they’re great. I’m in complete agreement!
Sightglass Coffee,This coffee shop is stylish and spacious and that’s what makes it go to spot for me. Love it because it never gets crowded so you always can find a quiet spot for work or couple of seats to chat with a friend. The coffee choice is great and you can buy ground coffee there as well. Their bakery is pretty good too. Highly recommend to check this place if you are near SOMA!
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite location in the city. This is where they roast their beans. The inside is huge, plenty of seating downstairs and upstairs.  We were pleasantly greeted with a display case overflowing with pastries. Pastries are from Neighbor Bakehouse and another bakery (not listed).  We enjoyed perfectly made flat white and latte.  Plus they were one of the only cafes opened at 7am."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee with a nice seating area. Enjoyed the Vanilla Paste Latte and the latte art was on point with my latte. We also got the Masala Chai but felt it was a bit muted and without a really strong flavor.
Sightglass Coffee,Amazing. The building is gorgeous. Very unique coffee shop. Awesome seeing the live coffee roasting take place.  I ordered a cappuccino and I enjoyed. Very rich coffee flavor. Didn’t taste like pure milk as other coffee shops tend to make. 👍🏽
Sightglass Coffee,"No outlets, no wifi, no air-conditioning. The exposed wood loft ceiling is cool looking, but if you're gonna have seating up there you'd probably want to have some A/C going on a warm day. The stars are for the good coffee and the friendly service --  (especially the person who helped me clean some grime from the subway off my bag)."
Sightglass Coffee,"Spacious and calming spot for coffee with beautiful sunlight exposure. Sat down for a morning coffee and bite while also doing some light work. The vibes here are top notch. Also, the curry potato puff is a must-try. Honestly, a strong recommend for cafe lovers."
Sightglass Coffee,I was here for a couple of hours on a Friday  morning. The pour over is fantastic I heard. And there's huge fan base for their coffee beans. Service was great! I got Ethiopia for my husband and he loves it! I ordered a mocha(not the best I've had) with a bite and worked out of this place. Loved the vibe. Ample space to sit and work. Will definitely visit again and not order mocha next time! :P
Sightglass Coffee,Slow and average. Two baristas working very inefficiently. It was not busy and I waited 10 mins for my cortado which I’d give a 3/10 - milk was over steamed (too hot and dry) and poured poorly. Barista seemed to be very inexperienced. Only redeeming quality was the nice cashiers at the front. I thought Sightglass was one of the better coffee co’s in the bay but it seems they’ve slipped.
Sightglass Coffee,The ambience is above and beyond. Having the roaster inside the store elevates the coffee experience. The coffee itself I would rate (6/10) it was not prepared properly.
Sightglass Coffee,This place is a great surprise. Great espresso and a great selection of pastries.
Sightglass Coffee,"The place is amazingly beautiful, but the coffee is SO bad. My dripped coffee looked like tea and tasted terrible. That's a shame for a place whose main business is to sell coffee. Everything else tho is perfect"
Sightglass Coffee,Best Latte in the city🫶 You can enjoy the whole cafe view from upper level and park your bicycle on the bicycle rack!🚲
Sightglass Coffee,"Loved the layout of the coffee shop. The music is slightly loud when you’re sitting by the second floor, but I generally love high ceilings so it was worth the trade. The morning bun was good, and I appreciated that there were so many open seats even on a Saturday afternoon."
Sightglass Coffee,"I’ve lived in SF, tried all the coffee shops, but this physical location to get coffee is superior in my opinion. The black coffee (for those who are into 3rd wave style) is phenomenal on drip, but the single origin espresso is pulled so well. Solid shots. A couple things to make note: huge pastry selection from local bakeries, and also they are dog friendly. Two dogs on leash with their owners, as a dog person I appreciate that. My favorite aspect is the design of their space. The Sightglass team really maximized a beautiful space and the natural lighting, the upstairs, and the classic coffee playlist is ideal for a productive workday/study day. Overall best coffee shop in SF if you’re into real coffee. If you get in earlier in the weekdays, you can smell and watch the coffee being roasted by their roaster. Cheers mate."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass Coffee is one of the first cafes I visited after moving to SF several years ago. To this day, it's still one of my favorite places to get coffee, or lattes, to be exact. Their pastries are quite good and they do offer a wide selection, from sweet to savory options (e.g., croissants, scones, pastelitos, empanadas,...).  If you are thinking of ordering some pastries and need a recommendation, I would go for any one of their croissants which are outsourced from Neighbor Bakehouse, a well-known bakery in the city. Just looking at them, you can tell they will be good. I personally think you could skip out on the gluten-free donuts, which are decent but not particularly noteworthy in comparison to some of the other GF donuts I have had before. I have tried the strawberry lemon donut which is apparently one of there more popular flavors, which tastes lightly of strawberry, and chocolate espresso donut, which tastes of chocolate.  This particular location, in SOMA, is unique because they have a gas coffee roaster which they use to roast their coffee beans throughout the day. It's also probably one of the more spacious cafes in the city, with two stories available to the public.  Note: The first floor of Sightglass is typically cool and shaded and has a number of seats surrounding the roaster. If you are interested in taking a look at the coffee roasting process, I would definitely recommend grabbing a seat there. The second floor also has a number of seats, as well as a private space for Sightglass employees. On sunnier days, this floor does get pretty hot. I felt using ""warm"" would be an understatement. Also, there is no wifi at this location. However, do not let that stop you from enjoying yourself. Bring a book or a friend.  I would definitely recommend checking Sightglass Coffee out sometime or another."
Sightglass Coffee,"Bright large space to enjoy your coffee at, with a lower and upper level to sit at! I enjoy their espresso drinks and have gotten affogato here in the past. They also have pastries. It's mostly metered street parking nearby. Would recommend stopping by if you're in need of some caffeine."
Sightglass Coffee,"Plenty of seating, really friendly staff, and great coffee! Super glad I tried this place"
Sightglass Coffee,"good coffee n pastries, nice atmosphere/good seating, but no WiFi."
Sightglass Coffee,Great place to work and study. The second floor is huge! Came here to network with someone I met through LinkedIn and we were able to hear each other talk. I recommend the ube cookie and matcha latte.
Sightglass Coffee,I really loved the space but it was so warm I started to sweat within moments.
Sightglass Coffee,"One of the best 'coffee and work' joints in San Francisco! Amazing selection of coffee, great open space to work & collab. The staff is very welcoming and cool! An inclusive space despite the neighborhood they are in. Sightglass now has AvoToasty acai bowls and avocado toast on Fridays and Saturdays"
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice space, very light and airy with the skylights and upstairs sitting area. I felt the staff is a little blase and short, but maybe that's part of the boheme cafe thing ;) Coffee quality was great, for the naturally steep SF price which is fine"
Sightglass Coffee,"Prefect latte. My latte had the right temperature, and tasted fresh. My first time getting coffee here. I was impressed by the vast space available to sit and they had the coffee roasting in the process. I understand the line was long, but as a first timer, the lady could have told me more about the location.  There is another coffee shop Sextant, and they are nothing compared to Sightglass. Don’t get mixed up of where to go just because these locations aren’t far away from each other."
Sightglass Coffee,"I love this place and always try to hit it up when I'm in SF. The new thing is on Fri -Sun they have an avocado toast pop-up and that's what is in the picture, along with a cup of Summer Solstice pour over."
Sightglass Coffee,"Latte is my favorite drink. Every where I go I order a latte I’ve been many many places, and I never experienced this taste of latte. And the way I order is super simple plain and regular milk.Love the latte!! Best ever try !! Customer service nice!! Okay area around."
Sightglass Coffee,"Had heard a lot about this place before visiting. Coffee was very average and got a takeout cup when I was dining in. Pain Chocolat was also not that good, with the location and ambience they can definitely do much better than this"
Sightglass Coffee,"If you want to have a special coffee, this place would be the best choice. :) I’ve tried  cortado, 1 shot of espresso with a equal amount of steamed milk, it was very nice!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Dog loves it here.  Don't order the cortado, they gave me a latte instead when I ordered one. 🤯"
Sightglass Coffee,"love this coffee shop - beautiful natural light, tasty coffees to choose from, and knowledgable kind baristas make this a stop anytime i’m in sf. ordered a pour over of the honduras and enjoyed the atmosphere. thanks for the hospitality!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Served a delicious, jammy Mexican coffee. Baked goods were on point and space is dope."
Sightglass Coffee,"I'm usually not left feeling with a good impression of coffee storefronts. But this store blew all my expectations. The coffee is fantastic. I was beginning to think good quality coffee wasn't a thing anymore in San Francisco. The pastry selection is fantastic. The staff obviously love their job and my personal favorite about the business is the building itself. I came here on a coffee outing with my boyfriend, but this is a space that can also be used for groups, meetings or if you want a relaxing, safe and comfortable environment to sip your coffee in. I will absolutely be returning and will be recommending this to everyone I know who can appreciate a good cup of coffee ☕"
Sightglass Coffee,"Awesome shop. Great care is taken in preparing drinks. My cappuccino was masterfully crafted, albeit I personally don't love the taste of their espresso. It seemed like a darker roast than is necessary, though it full well could have been a bad shot. C'est la vie, c'est le café."
Sightglass Coffee,High end coffee roasters with beautifully developed great sourced beans. If you want to see the whole process from roasting to packing to the espresso bar of the hand brew you can definitely see it here. Come take a look and enjoy your experience :-)
Sightglass Coffee,"Great,  great coffee spot in downtown San Francisco.  Staff was great,  coffee was excellent, with a large inside area. A tad over-priced but definitely delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,"We had tea and cappuccino, and they were great. My main issue is that there is no wi-fi or plugs, so how is it supposed to be a workspace? The only explanation is that it limits the users to the limit of their batteries, then they need to go to another coffee shop or something."
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing place to sit and unwind. Lots of seating, and the coffee is delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,Sight glass proudly display their coffee roasters which have a industrial beauty to them and if you know how to appreciate excellent coffee and how it’s made then come here. So sit and enjoy the magic.
Sightglass Coffee,"You will get a delicious coffee without fail at Sightglass. I try shops all over San Francisco, and while the competition is tight, Sightglass holds the lead for consistency and a great venue.  I roast my own coffee, so it's always fun to watch the roaster do their work while appreciating some of their output!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Very nice espresso bar! I'm a nerd about coffee, and they blow my nerdiness out of the water. Every grind is weighed. Every pour is weighed!! Upstairs there's 2 other separate espresso machines, smaller than the main. Leads me to believe their morning rush is insane. I came around 4 pm and it was mellow. Usual is a plain double shot. The body was rich and flavor nice. I wish I had a bag to take home a bag of beans. It was cool to see a side wall bike rack, that's SF for you. Everyone bikes lol! So happy to stumble upon this coffee haven."
Sightglass Coffee,"An ode to the beans. This place roasts, serves, and sells some of the best coffee around. They have a a great open space, 2 levels where you can enjoy or even work a bit. They have a cool industrial aesthetic going on."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sight glass is located on 7th Street and Folsom St. In my opinion, Sightglass coffee  is the best roastery in the SOMA area. The Muni bus lines12, 27, and 8 stop a block away. The Sightglass roasterie has drip coffee and premade coffee. The coffee is definitely top in SF and if you also like to people watch while drinking coffee then the split level balcony is ideal. I really like the interior design of wood, soft lighting, and granite. The building interior is original and the big beam roof rafters are a beautiful feature. This Cafe is a must visit if you are in SF as a tourist."
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent coffee! We ordered a cappuccino and vanilla latte. Both were amazing! Well balanced flavors!  Coffee is roasted and ground freshly in house. You can even watch the process of roasting in the cafeteria.  The decor of the store is impeccable and the environment is excellent!
Sightglass Coffee,There's always a line but it moves pretty quickly. The pastries are so good! I've been enjoying there coffee!😉..☕freshly roasted and brewed 🥐 Mushrooms & cheese yummy goodness! If you're in the area you should check it out. …
Sightglass Coffee,"Really enjoyed the vibe of the place as well as the matcha lattes I ordered plus a pastry. Prices are a bit steep, I paid $15 for the two items. To be fair the matcha latte and pastry were delicious. I was hoping to sit down and get work done on my computer here... Despite being a two story coffee shop they did not have any charging outlets and they do not have wifi. So my studying was short-lived."
Sightglass Coffee,"The carrot cake donut is delicious! I also had the masala chat latte, which is well balanced. The space is spacious and ideal for working remotely."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great industrial space, vertigo smell of roasting, and great espresso - not too hot, nor too bitter. The raspberry hazelnut croissant tastes every bit as good it looks.  The lack of WiFi is somewhat inconvenient, but the lack of power outlets more so - you need to be organised if you want to do some work here.  Pleasantly quiet at 830am on the Sunday of the #pride march, but got busy quickly."
Sightglass Coffee,"I went here because I heard about the hype- one of the best in San Francisco. I was not let down. The smell of coffee wafted through the industrial chic building. I could ask questions without looking stupid, and I could get great coffee. I wish I could stay longer or go back, worth a stop if you’re in the area."
Sightglass Coffee,Loved Sightglass.  Waited for an hr to get in. I bought the Winter Soltice (most popular beans per Cafe employee) beans and it was delicious with a caramel hint. I also got the pistachio croissant for about $5 or $6. I got their iced house vanilla latte...which was good and creamy.
Sightglass Coffee,My cappuccino was great as well as my hub’s vanilla latte. Really liked interior designed like industrial and loft vibe with cool stereo system. Pastry was great as well. Awesome service
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is great, and the interior is bougie! Some baked goods are from neighbor bakehouse. Great place to work."
Sightglass Coffee,"High quality, lots of space and friendly, knowledgeable baristas. On Fridays they have a free public cupping to showcase their coffee. They are great about answering questions and helping pick out what you might want."
Sightglass Coffee,Very good chai tea latte. It was not sugary (like Starbucks' cough cough) and  the oatmilk was steamed to the right temperature
Sightglass Coffee,"Fancy looking cafeteria with impressive roasting equipment running in the entrance. However, nonchalance and ignorance maximal followed when I asked if I could have my macchiato in a normal ceramic cup instead of paper cup. Understandably, it won't be much more pretty than this when you just pour it over from one to the other and then smack it down the table so that the foamed milk runs over the edge 😂. I had to ask the guy in the register if this is how they normally serve macchiato and tall guy said yes! So now you know, take a look at the photos."
Sightglass Coffee,"Super cool interior/ well preserved warehouse to work, drink coffee, converse in…. However 10-15 min wait when it’s busy to get a latte is a bit rough. Top notch product despite being sourced directly from the epicenter of the sf hipster barista movement."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and pastries. No outlets nor wifi at this location. Staff is not super friendly for a nice looking place like this.
Sightglass Coffee,"I messed up an online order this morning and ordered from the Potrero Hill neighborhood location of Sightglass by accident instead of this location. When I showed up asking for my online order, the very kind barista here at the SOMA location tried to find my order and when he realized my mistake, he immediately offered to make my same order free of charge. It was extremely comforting because I was running late, stressed, and needed my coffee and he could have easily not helped me because it was totally my fault for the error. Very grateful."
Sightglass Coffee,Very nice and friendly spot for enjoying a tremendous coffee. Feels very cozy inside!
Sightglass Coffee,"My go to coffee shop for hanging out and working. Lots of seating and tables. It does get quite busy though, so you may have to wait a hot minute for your coffee. I always get the vanilla iced cold and it's bomb.  Only complaint is that they close at 5, and I'd like to spend more time there :)"
Sightglass Coffee,"Staff were not very friendly, but the coffee made up for it. Baristas are definitely quite skilled; Honduras V60 pour over was fantastic."
Sightglass Coffee,Exotic coffee spot No Wi-Fi no electric outlets just talk to each other.  Their pastries are next level Get ice Vanilla latte with regular milk you will thank me forever
Sightglass Coffee,Sightglass was just a great experience.  Coffee was good and the overall vibe was super chill.  It was my morning stop everyday while visiting San Fran.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great place to chill and have coffee, plenty of seats, bright and high ceiling space. There’s a wall of bike racks for those who wanna park their bike at the shop. This place brew coffee from scratch. It’s like a cute little coffee factory! The bakery is also nice. Get the ham and cheese croissant or the seasonal fruit scone. My go to coffee is cafe latte. The staff were a bit unfriendly but if you don’t really care for that then it’s ok."
Sightglass Coffee,Delicious coffee with the perfect temperature!
Sightglass Coffee,"Very nice and spacious place. It is one of my favorite coffee shops in the neighborhood. Having that said, they don't have WiFi, which is quite unbelievable for 2020. They do have quite a few very nice, large tables. It truly is a great place to get work done, as long as it's offline or you don't mind sharing your mobile data to your laptop.  Would've given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the no-wifi situation."
Sightglass Coffee,"Mushy Croissant, lazy service. The only thing is the place is cosy."
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent espresso-based beverages made with care. Location is kind out of the way. Staff friendly and professional. Prices are a little exxy... but that's SF for you. 🤨 …
Sightglass Coffee,"Got to be one of my favourite coffee spots. Not only is the service good and the ambience nice but the coffee is great. The house blend, Owl's Howl is great."
Sightglass Coffee,Super fancy place and the latte was tasty as well 😋 👌 😊
Sightglass Coffee,The best coffee shop in San Francisco. I always order their hot latte and it is just PERFECT! I will for sure visit again! Staffs are also very friendly. Thank you for opening and staying with us during the pandemic.
Sightglass Coffee,A fantastic spot to get coffee. Interesting aesthetic and cool people. The coffee quality is top shelf. I subscribe to their coffee subscription and it offers some great beans. I highly suggest trying their seasonal holiday offering - fruity and roasted at the same time.  The folk there are knowledgeable and helped my fiance learn more about coffee and what she would like.
Sightglass Coffee,"I really enjoy the coffee from Sightglass, from a pour over or latte to an iced latte with oat milk. The pastries are delicious and they have open seating upstairs. I am from out of town so I make it a point to stop buy and buy a bag to take home. I first enjoyed their coffee at the Tuesday farmers market at the Ferry Building."
Sightglass Coffee,great in house roasted beans . strong and lingering after taste. second floor sitting is a bit warm tho even in winter. maybe laptops are emitting so much heat here
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee!  Got the Columbia (non express mode) and an apple turnover. Love the ambiance here drinking the coffee while watching and smelling beans roasting in the same room. Turnover was good but I came for the coffee. Nice place to hang for a few minutes before the workday.
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite place to get coffee and beans in San Francisco. Really, really good pour overs, and the espresso blend is great. There's a semi secret menu upstairs, they have other varieties of espresso occasionally."
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite cafe in soma! Very modern space with some extraordinary good coffee. Seems like a lot of local places uses the coffee they roast, and for a good reason. If you want a perfect cup of coffee visit Sightglass, you will not regret it"
Sightglass Coffee,"Simple coffee, good avocado toast on sourdough bread, nice vibe but few plug outlets.  Instagram: TianTianEats"
Sightglass Coffee,One of the most gorgeous coffee shops I’ve ever been to. It is a mix of a warehouse/ roastery/ working space and chilling area. Their pastries are delicious (the blueberry + pistachio was a bomb). You can also buy freshly roasted coffee and coffeeware.
Sightglass Coffee,Absolutely Amazing 😍  They have great Coffee ☕ and if you have the chance to visit them don't mis the pistachio croissant 🥐 🙏😭 its very Goood
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good coffee, the vanilla latte was good because it wasn’t oversweetened. It was a little too small for the price. 2-3 sips and you finished your coffee. Only had one size too."
Sightglass Coffee,"This branch of sightglass coffee is where it all began. Great coffee. Great vibes. They have seating on two levels, with communal type spaces. Good place to get some work done on your own or if you have to work with others. They don’t have free WiFi though."
Sightglass Coffee,"Always super friendly service and super quick and efficient. The baristas and cashier always talk to each customer like they’ve known you for a long time. The coffee is delicious as well and you can’t really go wrong ordering anything from here! Come by and try whatever, I doubt you’ll be disappointed!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Quite pleasant to realize that they have pastries from multiple bakeries, especially neighborhood bakery as they were closed this morning (don’t come up often to the city and wanted to check them out for a while). Got the raspberry/hazelnut croissant which was quite substantially impaired well with my decaf espresso from upstairs. Big and open and I really appreciated the indoor bike spaces. Rustic/wooden decor throughout helps you forget you’re in a big metropolitan city."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and pastries made by people passionate about coffee. The multiple bar system seems to cause far more confusion that it's worth but past that the store design is one of the best I've ever experienced with plenty of seating and a cool atmosphere. Open and industrial but somehow still managing to feel comfortable and even cozy if you score the right table for your visit.
Sightglass Coffee,"Myself a coffee lover, finally a truly remarkable espresso and cappuccino smooth and rich, served in ceramic cups plus exceptional pastries and croissants. Worth the extra mile."
Sightglass Coffee,Awesome place to relax and chill with friends. Free WiFi to do your computer  projects or surf the web. The affogato is delicious esp the Ethiopian coffee with the double folded vanilla.
Sightglass Coffee,"The inside of this place is mad cool, but with that aside the coffee is also fantastic. I got a cappuccino with oat milk ($5) and it was worth every over priced dollar. The espresso was dark and strong, easily can taste it through the foam and milk. I also find oat milk sweet sometimes and this drink was not sweet as the espresso balanced it really well."
Sightglass Coffee,"This is probably my favorite coffee shop in the city. The interior is very open and spacious, and there is a loft upstairs with plenty of seating. There is no WiFi though."
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is nice, but they don't have any way to heat up any food items, so expect your chocolate croissant to be cold. The interiors are pretty bleak and cold, could use some plants or rugs to liven up the space. There also isn't a ton of seating, despite the spaciousness of the shop itself. Giving it a 3 star rating purely for the coffee, and all the little waiting area outside for the cute doggos."
Sightglass Coffee,Lovely place with friendly staff & lots of seating!
Sightglass Coffee,"This is one of my fav spot but had a bad experience today. Got a half-filled cappuccino and mentioned this to the barista. instead of getting a new properly made cappuccino, she just poured more steamed milk. It destroyed the balance because now it’s way to foamy. I expect this from Starbucks, not Sightglass"
Sightglass Coffee,"Aggressive bad attitude by the lady in beanie and glasses. I didn't tip for a take away coffee, stared daggers and whispered to a colleague in front of me. Thank you hope you had a terrible day"
Sightglass Coffee,"Place is nice. It's cool that you can see the hipsters roasting your coffee beans. However, this snack cost $11.75 not including tip. With no refills for my coffee and the pastry can't even be warmed up for me. What did I just pay for? Just buy the beans and drink it at home. Pathetic as a cafe"
Sightglass Coffee,"Peter Pan tree house, for coffee. Aroma of roasting beans. Speck and manchego 'morning bun'. Coffee 5. Pastries 5. Service 5. Atmosphere 5. Did I mention custom bicycle parking? 5 years later: Same great ☕, same 🥵 in summer. No A/C, no WiFi"
Sightglass Coffee,very good coffee. cold modern space. good for chilling. bicycle friendly.
Sightglass Coffee,Nice place with plenty of room upstairs to work from
Sightglass Coffee,"4th stop on my coffee tour of SF.  I really wanted to like this place. I walked in and loved the atmosphere. I got in a 5 minute queue and ordered “a cortado for here” (again).  The cashier rang me up for a cappuccino. I pointed this mistake out and they told me that they just don’t have a computer entry for a cortado but the barista will make one.  I said “no worries” and waited patiently for my drink.  Much to my horror, I was served an 8oz cappuccino...to go...Literally every part of my order was wrong.  Instead of a strong espresso drink, I received a milky drink with a paper-cup taste.  On to the next shop..."
Sightglass Coffee,Nice place to hang out; tbd if coffee is worth the price ($20/lb)
Sightglass Coffee,"I was in the neighborhood and needed to get some caffeine for friends and this was nearby. Dropped in right before closing and picked up some coffees, a latte, and hot chocolates.... Of course I had to taste-test them all, and wow they were good. The barista was friendly and helpful."
Sightglass Coffee,"So far it is my favorite place to have a coffee around here. While it doesn't have a wifi and there's no electric outlets available for you, it's definitely not a bad thing. Otherwise it would be almost impossible to find a place to sit here. And it is actually a really nice place to sit here with your notebook and do some work or have a meeting or just simply enjoy an amazing cup of coffee on its own."
Sightglass Coffee,The veggie puff is to die for. The cappuccino is also pretty good. There is space to sit inside. The place gives a very inside the coffee bean factory kind of feeling which if you are into it might make the experience amazing.
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee that sightglass makes is good but the service is horrible. Overpriced cup and not even hot. When you ask to make it hot, they roll their eyes on you."
Sightglass Coffee,Almond milk Latte $6
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee is good and the interior is nice, but no power plugs or WiFi. The downstairs has limited seating and the place is usually crowded. They don't use any air conditioning, so the upstairs is really, really hot on most days! They also roast coffee here and the smell is very strong. If you're sensitive at all, you'll want to avoid this place."
Sightglass Coffee,Great Coffee shop! Love the coffee! Great place to set up small meetings with an upstairs sitting area.  I would total recommend this place to coffee lovers.  They have a wide selection of espresso drinks and also American style coffee.  If you are looking for beans they sell them too.  Beans are roasted in house.  There is also an assortment of pastries and other fun snack like breakfast items.  Friendly staff! Great vibe.
Sightglass Coffee,The atmosphere in this place is great but the espresso is a bit over extracted in my opinion. Other than that this place is cool and the pastries are great.
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee I have ever drink.
Sightglass Coffee,"Excellent coffee and friendly service. Pricey souvenirs are available, or fancy pastries, cookies or chocolates. I have had a raspberry-lime macaroon there which was worth every penny -- great texture, nicely tangy lime flavor and dusted with what seemed like powdered freeze-dried raspberry.  It's a really cool building, too, and huge for the area. Plenty of space to hang out and watch the world go by, or you can witness batches of coffee being roasted on premises."
Sightglass Coffee,One of the best Cafés I have ever been to in the US. Million times better than Starbucks. Pretty close to what you get in Italy or Austria. Just more expensive.
Sightglass Coffee,"Love their coffee and pastries! Whenever I’m in SF, I always make it a point to come here."
Sightglass Coffee,Nice place to sit at. Coffee and cake were delicious. There is metered parking right outside but can get full fast.
Sightglass Coffee,"Had a great flat white with oat milk. Hip, spacious coffee with some upstairs seating to hang out for a while."
Sightglass Coffee,I liked the place. Very comfortable for a meeting. Quiet to talk. Coffee is real good. Many good options.
Sightglass Coffee,"I expected more. I got the iced vanilla coffee. It is traditionally made with whole milk but I opted for almond milk. As someone who enjoys coffee a lot, this place was disappointing. My coffee was very sweet but barely tasted like coffee. My coffee was apparently ""cold brew"" but it's brewed hot and flashed cold which isn't exactly cold brew.  My girlfriend got a mocha with oat milk and the oat milk masked the entire mocha. She wasn't a huge fan and ended up tossing it after drinking half of it.  Overall, the ambiance is fantastic and seems to be a great place to work. But if you're coming here for coffee, go elsewhere because there's much to be desired."
Sightglass Coffee,"Just so you know - there is no Wi-Fi 🙄….I hope the owners get Wi-Fi. If people don’t want to use it, they can just use some self control and not connect, right? …"
Sightglass Coffee,"This is my go-to coffee shop in the city. I used to work nearby years ago and stop whenever I'm in the area. The vibe is still as good as ever as are the amazing baristas. Their affogatos are really good although my go-to order is a oat milk latte with a blueberry muffin. So good! Also, a tip if it's busy and there's a long line, head upstairs. They usually have someone working up there, and it may save you a few minutes."
Sightglass Coffee,"Delicious coffee (and pastries) and a great space. Some of the baristas are outgoing and friendly, others are all business, not even a smile. I'd love this place if it loved me back. Come here regularly."
Sightglass Coffee,"As soon as we walked into The Coffee Shop, the smell of freshly roasted beans hit us. Our server was very welcoming and gave great recommendations on what drinks would be best suited for our taste buds! We ordered a cappuccino and almond latte with extra foam and both were amazing!!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great overall experience but the younger, long haired fella with a hat could have been much more enthusiastic. He doesn't need to jump up and down with joy but a smile and less cold behavior is very valuable."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good, strong coffee . The place itself is so good and you get to see the coffee being roasted and packed, etc as you enjoy your coffee. Enough room to sit and work or catch up with a friend or two."
Sightglass Coffee,"All our coffee and tea drinks were served cold, when we asked the baristas to heat them up they rolled their eyes at us and gave back lukewarm cups. They coffee is overpriced, the place has no wifi or charging ports either"
Sightglass Coffee,"Consistently great coffee, I had a cup of pourover in the morning and then a flat white in the arvo. Both amazing cups of coffee that were poured perfectly.  I think the flat white was probably the best one I had in North America. Top notch baristas here"
Sightglass Coffee,"Had a really good cup of cappuccino there! This sightglass flagship store is really beautiful! But as popular in SF, no WiFi"
Sightglass Coffee,Nice coffee place for nomad workers. Only one drawback is there is no power outlet available. You should come this place with your battery full.
Sightglass Coffee,Never a doubt. This place is a treat. It's sitting on my top 5 any coffee places I had visited (I drink too much coffee). My go-to is their cortado.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, great atmosphere. I loved their vanilla latte."
Sightglass Coffee,"I really like Sightglass Coffee. Good pour over and espresso-based drinks. Have most of the alternative milk available. They also have pastries but they sold out fast especially on the weekends. They source beans from many places around the world, and it is really fun to try beans from different regions.  The interior of the space was nice with 2 levels of seating. There is a roaster in the middle of the place, and you can often see the roastmaster at work. The staff are (most of time) friendly and will gladly give you recommendation (when they are not too busy). I really appreciate the staff members who go above and beyond and have a little chat with me about their preferences and offer suggestions.  Great place."
Sightglass Coffee,Great atmosphere and experience. You can watch them roast and package the coffee. They have a center island where you can order and then watch the barista prepare your drink. And finally there's a upper level terrace where you can take it all in.
Sightglass Coffee,It's a beautiful store with amazing coffee. The Ethiopian wasn't overly a acidic and had a great balance of flavors.
Sightglass Coffee,"A truly great place if you're a coffee fan. I got a latte and chocolate croissant, sat and watched how a new batch of coffee beans was being roasted. It looks inconspicuously from outside, but very stylish inside."
Sightglass Coffee,"Pretty good matcha latte with vanilla--altho I got those little crunchy granules from the vanilla at the bottom. I love that texture, but maybe others don't; thought I'd warn any who ask for vanilla in their drinks. Not too sweet but not relying on its natural flavor either--which i find a good balance."
Sightglass Coffee,"Thank you for the kind review! The granules are natural, pure blended vanilla bean pods, which is what makes our vanilla paste so delicious!"
Sightglass Coffee,Awesome coffee shop. Great menu and lots of variety available in their beans.
Sightglass Coffee,"Functional, industrial/warehouse vibe roasting facility that is also a multi-level open space to enjoy your favorite coffee.  Baked goods are worth a try; not Tartine, but still a nice complement to the coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,Staff was really helpful and coffee was amazing. it's a great place to visit especially to see how coffee is roasted.
Sightglass Coffee,Very nice place with natural light and plenty of seating. Just wish the menu was a little more extensive!
Sightglass Coffee,The drip coffee was good and the sweet thing of chocolate and raspberry i ate with the coffee was so delicious that i could eat it all day
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee on point, but petite.  Need a place to hide for all us introverts, this is that place.  Get your mood swing on and lead with temptation."
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee took a long time even though there weren't many people in line, coffee with oat milk was done well but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee itself, the cafe is very cool, it's huge with a second floor and you can sit up there and see everyone doing all the work one does in a roastery/ cafe. The music was too loud and annoying"
Sightglass Coffee,I love this coffee shop. I always get the vanilla paste latte cause it has just enough sweetness for me. Can’t resist the pistachio croissant covered in powdered sugar. Plus the atmosphere is fun and open. I love watching them sort and bag the coffee during the week.
Sightglass Coffee,I always make the effort to visit whenever I’m in SF. Come for the space & enjoy a quality coffee to boot. Highly recommended
Sightglass Coffee,"I really enjoy their single origin espresso roasts. Nicaragua is my fav! Pictured below are the affagato: ice cream from Salt & Straw, and an iced Americano with milk. 🔑 …"
Sightglass Coffee,Super nice coffee and staff.
Sightglass Coffee,"It's another cookie cutter hipster coffee shop with high ceilings and cement whose only purpose is to extract money from customers who are mostly there to be by seen with their latest MacBook. Very expensive and sadly, the cafe latte wasn't even good and the $6 pastry was dry."
Sightglass Coffee,"No plugs, not a lot parking, but has a great view, lots of seating, very tasty coffee. Little expensive though, but I suppose most people come here to work, meet, or to study."
Sightglass Coffee,"Okay, Sight Glass coffee isn't cheap coffee. But that's exactly why you came here. Good, smooth,  flavorful expression to satisfy your senses I have to say today's visit did exactly that with a cappuccino. My cup was one of those experiences not requiring anything but just what was served. Coming from a raw sugar lover that says much. It all starts with an excellent roast. Certainly smelled great this morning. The rest is the skill of the barristo, who this visit was Matt. You made great cup today and I will be walking back down in a moment for more.  Thanks Matt!  Also taken was a pistachio croissant with blackberry paste filling. Much better than expected. A sort of risk on my part since I am a self-avowed croissant snob. While not a perfect filled affair, it was tasty and well worth the price paid .  Total for the cappuccino and pastry was $10.33.  Not cheap. Every bit fulfilled the value you might expect.  Sight glass sells as well.  You'll probably take a pound or two when you leave. :)  As for the location it can be described as warm open warehouse look and feel with plenty of counter and table space for meeting family and friends.  Lots of windows and roof skylights let in the sun to give it a bright look augmenting the soft hanging lights. Iron work and wood every where you see. Tri-levels with a wide open view from front to back. The perfect ambiance for coffee roasting coffeehouse experience.  If you love a great coffee experience Sight Glass is one of the Must-Go places in San Francisco."
Sightglass Coffee,Awesome coffee and super chill space with lots of seating. The baristas were very friendly and super helpful.
Sightglass Coffee,Coffee is very flavorful. Different then your typical Starbucks or peets. The atmosphere is very trendy with lots of space to work or hangout
Sightglass Coffee,Enjoyable coffee spot in the upcoming Mission district.  Update 5 years later: the place is still very nice but the pastry is overpriced for the quality.
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee, whatever. You're just another person dying to buy their coffee and they will treat you like one. From the cashier to the barista. Looking for experience? Get outta here! Another self-obsessed cafe. They get one star because it's wheelchair friendly."
Sightglass Coffee,Good latte and granola. Lots of seating in two floors. Loved the atmosphere.
Sightglass Coffee,"This is a fantastic coffee shop. They've got all of the staples, plus extras galore! This was there primary roasting facility at one point. Now I believe they they have more roasting off-site, but they still roast here. The glorious smell of freshly roasted coffee is alive in this space. Upstairs is a secondary coffee bar, complete with affogato service (featuring vegan ice cream)! Their merchandise isn't obscenely expensive either, so stock up if you're an at-home barista. I could not recommend these guys more."
Sightglass Coffee,"Had a great esspresso there with an awesome taste. You can drink your coffee inside, and also buy some coffee beans there with there own roastery inhouse.  They work inside of the coffeeshop and prepared some boxes for shipping. Feels a bit like you sit in middle of a coffee factory, which felt cool."
Sightglass Coffee,The architecture is so loft and modern. Coffee is amazing. Love this place. 😆 …
Sightglass Coffee,"Pretty latte art, strong coffee and lots of space. There are two floors. Only downside is there is no wifi and power sockets."
Sightglass Coffee,I stop by every year from my walk from my hotel to the caltrain station to go towards San Jose. The ambiance is fantastic.
Sightglass Coffee,"Character with my morning latte! Three story industrial space with coffee roasting live on premise! Baked goods looked fresh, real and divine."
Sightglass Coffee,"The hot cocoa was not sweet, but very favorable. Atmosphere is very nice with fresh coffee being roasted in lobby. Must try!"
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is amazing, its spacious with two floors. The afogato drink is awsem (choose the lavender and honey Icecream) and its serverd from the second floor counter."
Sightglass Coffee,"Exactly what I was looking for as an out of towner visiting SF.  The raspberry almond croissant was delightful and the coffee even better. Will be ordering some to be delivered for sure!  Minus a star due to lack of wifi, although I used my hotspot, service isnt always reliable."
Sightglass Coffee,"I ordered a hot almond milk latte and I waited well over 10 minutes. They gave me an iced latte,I told them I ordered a regular latte and she made this fairly quickly. However when I got home I discovered that it was a regular milk latte. Basically I overpaid for slow service and a drink I can't have. I would LOVE a refund, but I highly doubt I'd ever receive one, nor would I go all the way back."
Sightglass Coffee,One of my favorite coffee places in SF.
Sightglass Coffee,Great place to sit and work for an afternoon. There is tons of space/seating and while there didn’t seem to be an outdoor patio some of the seating is close to open doors so it has an open air feel. The herbal tea was good too.
Sightglass Coffee,"A favorite of mine. I love the log cabin-steampunk feel they’ve got going on. There’s coffee equipment surrounding all of the seats and a second floor which is an amazing sight to watch the baristas and the customers. Oh and the coffee has a lot of care put into it. I believe they roast it themselves, weigh every shot, and time the extraction. Impressive stuff!"
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and atmosphere. A good spot to sit and chill or get some work done.
Sightglass Coffee,Best ice Vanilla latte in The world! They use fresh vanilla beans infused with your choice of creamy milk!
Sightglass Coffee,Their Owls Howl beans are the best I’ve ever had for Espresso.
Sightglass Coffee,"very trendy ,snobish,if your not 20_30 and a tech type,you get automatically vibe""d in a smurkey sly(- ""as not to be obvious about their politically incorrect behavior they hide behind fake smiles and dogs that are only there as a fashion accessory) ""-smiles😉.. …"
Sightglass Coffee,"the best coffee and roasters I have been able to try. The highest quality products and options that is relative to the current interest. The coffee drinks are so good. Now that the place is open again, the service is very efficient and the place is very open and inviting. The staff seem very active on task and having fun, while being accommodating to the customers, that offers a convenient and enjoyable experience."
Sightglass Coffee,The ultimate coffee of the world champions!! Ice vanilla latte and pistachio croissant
Sightglass Coffee,Not the best staff but they have great coffee
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing coffee with lots of delicious treats from local bakeries. Great working space if you need a place away from the home office (definitely not quiet, but also not noisy either). Reasonably priced and you'd be supporting a local business!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Good espresso, best putting, an excellent location to kick back with buddies & exact espresso. The staff was so useful explaining all of the gadgets."
Sightglass Coffee,"Hands down the best affogato I have ever had. They partner with salt and straw ice cream for their affogatos. The affogato bar is on the second floor, so go there directly :-)  I had the honey lavender ice cream and Kenyan espresso for my affogato!"
Sightglass Coffee,One of the best places for study&coffee!
Sightglass Coffee,I was recommended this place to sit down and do some school work. Nice place and ambiance in vibe. No outlets to charge phone or laptop is a bummer. The water dispenser was a savior for my dehydration and I filled up my water bottle there.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great industrial atmosphere. Great baristas. Great coffee.  It’s all self service, so defeats the purpose of gratuity (Probably unpopular opinion) when you’re paying $6 for coffee and $7 for a croissant.  Also no oven to warm up baked goods. Out of curiosity, is it that difficult to manage an oven?"
Sightglass Coffee,I love the coffee. One of the beat I've had. Would definitely come back to get my Cup of Joe.
Sightglass Coffee,"Just love the woody tune, open space and of course Coffee... a must visit"
Sightglass Coffee,Open space with cool interior. They’ve got the best latte in soma!
Sightglass Coffee,"I love their coffee, I wish they were offering warming pastries"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, tasty pastries and a lovely space with lofty upstairs seating looking down over roastery, barista island and bean packaging. Lovely experience, but sometimes long waits to place order --- they need a third POS station."
Sightglass Coffee,Must visit place for coffeeholic if you visit San Francisco. Tried Kenya that day and really like it.
Sightglass Coffee,Website offers a $5 discount if you give your personal information. Gave it and got an email with only 10% off. Whatever. Placed an order and the promo code was declined. Pretty shady business practice.
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee I’ve had so far in SF. Nice pastries as croissants scones and cookies. Such a cool place
Sightglass Coffee,"Really neat place, a lot of space with workers roasting and packaging beans out in the open to see. Didn’t see any plugins to use while working on my laptop."
Sightglass Coffee,Loved the experience
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent latte( house blend ). Also they offer single origin espresso upstairs. Unfortunately indoor temperature is hot and humid !
Sightglass Coffee,"Trendy supplier of excellent coffee. Friendly and helpful staff, Good selection of pastries. One of the best coffees I've had this time in SF"
Sightglass Coffee,Amazing coffee in a very unique location. It is a very cool roasting operation that you can watch while you sip your coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"Loved the space, it was beautiful and airy, the people behind the counter were friendly, and there was enough parking around. I am no coffee connoisseur but this coffee was not overly pleasing to me. Whenever I try a new coffee place I always order the same thing: a hot mocha with almond milk. This one had quite a mild taste with very little coffee flavor and ample bitterness, in my humble opinion. Still gave it 4 stars for the cool vibes, and transparency of their roasting process."
Sightglass Coffee,"My cousin and cousin-in-law took my sister and I here for the first time last month. The coffee shop is tucked away in a narrow street area that is surrounded by tall business buildings. I really enjoy this coffee shop because there is plenty of seating, and the whole interior is very clean and minimalistic. There is additional parking in the back of the coffee shop. I ordered their iced vanilla latte and I was instantly hooked, because the coffee is freshly made and it tastes great. The prices for their drinks and pastries are also reasonably fair. I arrived here again a few hours ago after running some errands, and I was not disappointed. I'll be back if I'm ever in the area."
Sightglass Coffee,"My partner and I were visiting relatives in San Francisco last week. We came across Sightglass coffee on our way home to Southern California. Our barista Forrest, was most helpful. We enjoyed our most delicious Cappuccinos on our long drive home. We will definitely be visiting again."
Sightglass Coffee,Lovely place. Super nice staff.
Sightglass Coffee,They had a cart in front during woodworking remodel phase.  Good pastries
Sightglass Coffee,Coffee was great but a barista wasn’t nice 😩
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, great space, great details, great vibe, great baristas, great music....."
Sightglass Coffee,Cool place. An actual coffee roaster in the city. Delicious pricey coffee. Sadly no WiFi.
Sightglass Coffee,Can’t sell $6 coffee and then have no Wi-Fi.
Sightglass Coffee,awesome coffee and bread. price is reasonable and the vibes from the store are very cool. lovely place in San Francisco.
Sightglass Coffee,Brilliant roaster with some very interesting types of coffee. Cappuccino was excellent and the daily brew was a great Colombian. Highly recommend this place!
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is mind blowing - it's like a hands-on coffee museum!  The coffee roasting machine in the front is the highlight of the place - you can see how coffee is roasted right here! It's the real deal - an all out show of wrought iron, fire, and flavor!  A great place to gather with friends or hold a private event - lots of room, great lighting, and masterful decorations.  The coffee tastes good, sugar is sweet, cream is creamy, service is polite.  Pastries are good but don't expect them to be warned up."
Sightglass Coffee,I ordered a hot chocolate and I waited well over 20 minutes watching them handover coffees and hot chocolates to people who ordered after me since they 'lost my ticket'. They made a quick one for me in 30 seconds which was nothing but just hot milk with cocoa powder on top. The chocolate croissant was average. Definitely not going back.
Sightglass Coffee,Nice ambience. Coffee is a bit towards the acidic taste
Sightglass Coffee,The coffee is good. The vegan snickerdoodle’s are tempting
Sightglass Coffee,"Overall experience, great. The vegan chocolate chip was good. A little crispy for my liking yet flavorful. Customer service was excellent. The cashier was patience and walked me through the menu. Had a vast knowledge of the menu which was a plus. Extremely clean and roomy restaurant. Several tables for eating. Will return in the future to try something else on the menu."
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee beans I have ever gotten. They not only were high quality but also had very interesting notes.  The folks at the coffee shop make great coffee. I did wish there was more seating area where I could do work without everyone seeing what's on my screen, but the space itself is very cool and unique. Big plus on having lots of bike racks in the front."
Sightglass Coffee,Gorgeous interior and delicious coffee to boot.
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful space, love the design and the coffee is amazing."
Sightglass Coffee,"While the walk there is a bit dodgy, inside is a safe, coffee lovers haven! Great creative atmosphere and great coffee, highly recommend it!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Second floor seats are open now! My friend and I were upstairs drinking pour over, it was a little hot upstairs but generally I loved the place. And love the beans as always."
Sightglass Coffee,I’ve gotten coffee to go from here a bunch - I like the iced coffees in the summer after yoga at Ritual. This last visit : Coffee was pretty good. I had a pour over. I like the atmosphere of this place and worked from here for a bit. I wish the seats were more comfortable but like the high ceilings and light.
Sightglass Coffee,It is pretty expensive for what you get and how long everything takes. The staff is friendly though.
Sightglass Coffee,Super nice place with phenomenal coffee. a good selection of pasties and a nice atmosphere  Roasts there beans there and has wide selection of blends with great tasting notes. Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Overpriced a bit (of course). Has some gluten free and some vegan pastures (neither of both)  They don't serve tea.
Sightglass Coffee,"Long line was worth the wait! Great coffee (I got a latte). The inside is very well designed and boasts neat features such as a record glazer, chandeliers, and unique sitting areas."
Sightglass Coffee,"What a cool concept. Spacious, original, and coffee is darn good"
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is good but a tad on the expensive side, this is definitely not a place to study or get work done though. No outlets, minimal seating, no wi-fi, and no bathrooms. They send you to a public park  which is a 5 minute walk away to use the restroom."
Sightglass Coffee,"super spacious, delicious coffee. Maybe not the best place to get work done - no WiFi"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great spot to jam for an hour or two with a latte or coffee and pastry.  No wifi, so plan accordingly (hot spot with sprint / t-mobile worked totally fine)"
Sightglass Coffee,great and huge loft! probably the best coffee shop venue in the city.  no wireless though.  Coffee is fantastic.  Beans that needs no cream and sugar because it's already so creamy and sweet.  the atmosphere is fabulous. You get a front seat view on how your coffee is made.  The pastry selection is pretty decent as well.  A must for the coffee snobs.
Sightglass Coffee,Loved the place!! The coffee was perfect 👌 no WiFi..  But I gusse that would keep people there all day! Lol …
Sightglass Coffee,"Fantastic coffee here, by people who really do care about their coffee. Their roast had a lovely smooth flavour, unlike some other roasters.  The pastries were pretty cool too, the pistachio blackberry croissant was a nice change from the more common almond variety.  The feel of the place was a good balance of hip. One thoughtful and impressive feature was exposing a roaster in the middle of the café. Sure was great to see your coffee roasted in front of you.  A well thought out process, style and place overall."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee and pastries, cool place to sit down"
Sightglass Coffee,I love espresso from Sightglass especially this branch. Love the affogato bar too.
Sightglass Coffee,"Cappuccino wasn't hot enough, but the design was good, and the taste was good (but could be richer)"
Sightglass Coffee,"This is a bland, boring an bitter coffee. Yet the place seems full most of the time. So, I wonder if the baristas intentionally over or under-extracted my espresso for my cappuccino in the two different occasions that I visited this place? Either way on each visit I was consistently disappointed because there was no flavor other than bitterness in my cappuccino."
Sightglass Coffee,Amazing affogato bar and fantastic atmosphere. Some of the best espresso I've tried.
Sightglass Coffee,"I love the design of this place. It’s a must-visit spot in SF for the whole experience, plus the delicious coffee. I got the Vanilla Cold Brew with almond milk on a hot afternoon and my husband went back several times for the espresso. Service is friendly and very quick!"
Sightglass Coffee,This place is great and the set up it really unique. Their coffee is really well done (not burnt) and is really smooth to drink even if you go hardcore and get an espresso. Also their pastries are great! Definitely a good place to go if you are a coffee lover.
Sightglass Coffee,"Love the space, no-attitude baristas, and awesome coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,Will go back and want to try everything they got. Lofty and industrial atmosphere makes more special. Check out the second floor for affogato.
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good coffee in a very nice space. Staff is typical third wave coffee, which is to say trendy and reasonable. Would have 5 stars if it weren't just on the edge of a bad neighborhood. You may need to pass some pretty sketchy characters to get here if walking."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great place to meet up with friends, family, or client for a chat. The drip coffee was very good. Lots of room. They have upstair with lots of room. Everything very clean. Bathroom sinks are located outside of the bathroom which is brilliant, so you can wash your hands after touching the bathroom handles if that matters to you. Overall great atmosphere!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Trendy place with cool coffee accessories and stacks of bagged coffee beans. The shop is very cool looking, the coffee was decent but not overwhelming (Kenyan pour over), and the various coffee accessories provide a distraction while you wait. Overall worth a taste if it's on your way, but not worth going out of your way to taste."
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is VERY cool on the inside, and also very thoughtful for having hooks for your dog and unique bike racks outside. However, I thought the coffee was very overpriced. I ordered their pour over  that was on special that day and found it to not only be less than a full mug, but also on the bitter side. They also do not have enough options quick/decently healthy breakfast bites, they pretty much just have pastries and granola."
Sightglass Coffee,Best cold brew I’ve ever had. They roast right out in the open as well. Wonderful experience.
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee and pastries are great, but super expensive (drip coffee was $4 and chocolate croissant was $4.50). The space is great and has a good ambience, I like meeting people for coffee here. I don't think I would come here on my own though given the price tag"
Sightglass Coffee,"This by far is my favorite coffee shop to visit. It's a ritual to visit for coffee here at this specific location. The high ceiling and wood immediately is welcoming. The design of the cafe is unique and feels well thought out. The roasting and packing of coffee is all done on sight. I particularly like sitting on the second level where there are ample tables for groups, those working with laptops, and a nice bar overlooking the cafe below. Excellent coffee and food every time. Time has not diminished my experiences here - each time is like my first many years ago now."
Sightglass Coffee,"The ambiance of the entire cafe will make you never want to leave. They have a giant coffee bean machine, a second floor, a fully stocked pastry case, some of the largest plant terrariums I've seen, oh yeah, and some really good coffee. The coffee is made well, with a diverse set of blends, beans, and options. Each brew is quite strong, and the service is fantastic. Perfect place to hang out, work, or enjoy a good cup of coffee on your own."
Sightglass Coffee,"Wonderful, airy, open space and friendly, down-to-earth staff. Coffee is excellent, but the pastries are a bit expensive for what you get - the cake I got was a bit dry.  They have plenty of bike parking and restrooms for customer use."
Sightglass Coffee,"Got my iced, vanilla coffee super fast, and it was really good. I also had a carrot-bran muffin which was delicious. The normal coffee is great as well. We were in and out in maybe seven minutes, and that's including our wait in a line, so they're very efficient. Really cool space; I highly recommend this place for a quick cup of coffee and snack."
Sightglass Coffee,"Ordered two lattes one with oat milk and a kouign-amann.  The lattes were so delicious! I could have passed on the kouign-amann, it was a bit dry.  Service was fast and friendly. The interiors were cool. Would probably go out if my way in the future to get coffee from here again!"
Sightglass Coffee,"I have been there and fall in love in this place. great. great. great. One for the coffee, another one for the atmosphere and the last one for professional service!!!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Wow, took me by surprise. The first sip of my oatmilk cappuccino was nice, but oh my, that lingering flavor. Wow."
Sightglass Coffee,"Hyped but overrated. It has a very nice industrial touch and overall the space is quite large so you can sit by the window (people spotting!!!) or next to the roasters or up on their balcony. However the staff was not very friendly, got our order wrong and in general did not seem very interested. Coffee was good though."
Sightglass Coffee,Love industrial vibes. No wifi
Sightglass Coffee,"Raw wood and metal ambiance with the mechanic crank and whirling of a roasting machine in the background.  The coffee is excellent, shhhhh not the best cappuccino (my person metric) I've had in sf although very good.  I'll never tell. Definitely worth the visit.  Also, no where to plug in devices.... suggesting techies not to linger for 12 hrs"
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing espresso drinks and pastries. No Wi-Fi or outlets for dine-in guests, fyi. Great place to sit, meet with friends, get work done, and enjoy a good coffee or tea drink."
Sightglass Coffee,"If you are the type of person who likes coffee, this is the best place. You can visit here either alone or in a group. The chairs were comfortable and the restroom is well designed and maintained. They have fast WiFi and power outlets that are available for charging. You can visit the place anytime. Highly recommended!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Perhaps my favorite coffee stop of San Fransisco so far, this place has a lot going on inside.  First off, I've never been disappointed with the coffee here. I've had three standard lattes, but never asked about the roast. They tasted like medium roasts, with no overly strong flavor in any direction. Just a perfectly mild coffee, which is just what I want sometimes.  Next is the space. There's a lot of it here, with active roasting happening to your right, packing/shipping of beans on your left, and what I can only assume is admin/tech on half the second floor. It's an open design, so you can see _everything_ that's happening, and it always seems busy. There's sitting areas to the front and the back half of the second floor. Again, the place is huge, so even when it's busy, there's probably room for you. However, as with everywhere in SF it seems, there's no outlets, so laptop users will have a time limit."
Sightglass Coffee,"I really wanted to love this place, but maybe I just got the wrong item. I saw a lot of reviews recommend the vanilla cold brew, and I even confirmed with the barista if it was super sweet, as I only enjoy lightly sweetened coffee. Not only was it incredibly syrupy, I felt like I basically got an iced vanilla milk as the coffee was not present enough. I love the atmosphere though and would love to come back for a pourover or espresso drink. They get their pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse, so try the raspberry hazelnut croissant if they have it!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great place.  Cool atmosphere.  Great morning bites - breakfast granola, croissants, buns, cookies.  Great coffee.  Definitely artisan coffee... be prepared to pay normal hipster prices for great coffee. No wifi is a bummer so you can't really work unless you bring your own hotspot.  The employees are very nice and happy to answer all questions."
Sightglass Coffee,One of my favorite buildings in the city! I love the open floor plan with ample seating upstairs. It's something special to watch production occurring right there on the floor. The scent of roasted beans is stunning and natural light fills the entire warehouse. It's one of those cafe's you can spend an entire afternoon in!  The vanilla cold brew and chocolate raspberry scone are my favorite combination!
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee served by great staff with a cool COVID setup. Their hot or iced Vanilla Paste Lattes are probably one of my favorite drinks in the world, but you really can't go wrong with anything here!"
Sightglass Coffee,This is my favorite coffee shop when I travel to San Francisco. So beautiful to look at and so comfortable to be at when you’re looking for a sweet place to relax and have amazing coffee. I attended one of their cuppings on Friday and it was such an amazing learning experience. I definitely recommend this to anyone in San Francisco.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great tasting coffee! I ordered a cup of  cappuccino, this is what happened: the girl was sitting by the second floor coffee bar, digging her mouth with her fingers! After she got my order, without washing her hands, she just made the cappuccino! I didn’t complain at the moment, didn’t want to be hurtful to her, but after this I have been feeling very grossed and never want to visit again."
Sightglass Coffee,"We were eyeing 3 different places to go that's close by(didn't really want to drive to Intelligentsia)  at 8 pm on a Saturday.  We just want to stay in Culver City, grab our drinks and leave. Well, that didn't happen. When we got here, we decided to just sit and relax while enjoying their empanadas and blueberry pound cake with our drinks. This place is huge! Their patio is gorgeous!  Staff were friendly!  Ample parking."
Sightglass Coffee,A quick caffeine stop before a busy day in the city.
Sightglass Coffee,"Excellent coffee. Market prices. Great staff, dyed in the wool hipsters who know their coffee well. Also, Square is a little pretty neat feature they have going on. I can't wait until the whole space opens up, and there's some proper seating to the place."
Sightglass Coffee,One of my favorite local coffee shops in the city. Lots of space to work with nice wood interior. I really like the selection of pastries and the iced coffee with almond milk. Try the everything croissant from Neighbor Bakehouse. Delicious! It's stuffed with cream cheese!
Sightglass Coffee,"Excellent coffee in a beautiful space. No problems finding a seat here. Much lighter roasts than Blue Bottle bring out a different flavor profile... really nice to contrast the two, with BB being just a few blocks down and both in lovely spaces."
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is amazing - both aesthetically and coffee-wise.  Great place to order your coffee (they have it ALL) and hang out, read, people watch, etc.  Would love to come back again soon."
Sightglass Coffee,"This is a great place to come for coffee in the afternoon. Parking can be a problem, but is usually worth the effort. The coffee is good and the atmosphere is spectacular. Most days you can see and smell coffee being roasted. There is seating at a bar that wraps around the coffee roasting area and is really interesting to watch the whole process. In another section there are workers packing up the freshly roasted coffee for shipment. They have really cool bathrooms with shared sinks outside. They are located in a repurposed old warehouse building with high ceilings, and a second floor seating area that overlooks the entire main floor. This is a pretty busy place. Usually filled with lots of young techie looking coffee drinkers working on laptops. Often difficult to find a seat but worth going."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of my favourite places in SF to enjoy some real good coffee. It's brewed with time, patience and dedication. Besides I like the atmosphere. It's inspiring and relaxing at the same time to me. Take a stroll to SoMa for this delicious coffee...you won't regret it."
Sightglass Coffee,Love this decor and the ambiance it gives off. Very well lit and plenty of space to do your work here or to quickly catch up with peeps. Their slow drip iced coffee is definitely something to try out. The environment and brew does give off the Blue Bottle-esque style so this place is the place to go for those hipster coffee drinkers out there. Definitely lived up to its hype.
Sightglass Coffee,"Still excellent. I've been going to Sightglass since they first opened the door and served Verve coffee from the small entry area. Now due to the pandemic they're back in the entry area. Sightglass beans have never let me down. Owl's Howl is my usual espresso at home. I've found their coffee making at the 7th st location a little uneven over the years but we're talking a range of good to excellent so this isn't a complaint. Their space on 7th is beautiful, I look forward to the end of the pandemic so we can visit indoors again, hear some good music on vinyl, and see some nice plants. Their pastry/food selections continue to be excellent. Recent additions of quiches and pies are fantastic."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of the top places in San Francisco for coffee. Solid pastries, not much non-coffee drinks. There's more seating upstairs which runs a bit warm (great for cool foggy SF days), and if you want to cool off more, there's the affogato bar tucked away upstairs. Woody hipster feel. Good for working during weekdays and 5 pm onward on weekends, though bring your own Internet connection."
Sightglass Coffee,"Awesome place to chill and get some work done over a latte.  Coffee, espresso, mochas, all taste great.  Their pastries, even the vegan choices taste great.  That being said like many places in SF, no power outlets, no wifi.  Gotta walk through a dumpy part of the city to get here.  Height of the chairs vs table height makes for really uncomfortable seating if you're there for anything more than an hour or using a laptop.  Really large place, but seating will almost always be limited.  Don't expect to be in-and-out.  Always takes a hot minute to get through the line and then wait for your drink"
Sightglass Coffee,"They roast really good coffee. The cafe doesn’t have WiFi, but the food and beverages are top notch. Docked 1 star because of WiFi."
Sightglass Coffee,"Loved the vanilla cold brew, not too strong vanilla flavor. Really cool setup with beans being roasted right in the shop. Easy access to 80 east too, for our way out of SF."
Sightglass Coffee,"Another great coffee shop in an area jam-packed with world class coffee shops. This one has an almost steampunk feel to it, and would make a terrific place to bring your laptop and get some work done. Lots of natural lighting which I am always a fan of too."
Sightglass Coffee,Expect a little wait. The line tends to move fast during the normal busy times. I personally love the mocha though you can't go wrong with a pourover. Cafe space upstairs is reliably crowded but downstairs you can usually get a seat at the bar. Fun to watch beans being roasted and packed.
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee, and they have lots of seating upstairs with awesome wooden tables. Love seeing their roasting equipment out in the open. Their cappuccino was super smooth. They have an additional bar that you can get coffee from upstairs. You can also pay with Square. Great location in SOMa near lots of companies' offices."
Sightglass Coffee,"There's plenty of bike racks out the front, two floors so you can always find a seat, nice selection of pastries and coffee beans. The dim lighting is suitable for a catch-up with a friend or casual business meeting. The long bar downstairs is a nice place to do some work or read a book, without any judgment."
Sightglass Coffee,"One of my favorite coffee houses in the city.  Pain to park but that's the city. I love the huge spacious warehouse.  Where you can see the coffee business in action.  Roasting on the right (I'm not a coffee expert but that's what I thought it was), packing in the left, training upstairs and their office as well. You can sit downstairs or upstairs and see it all go on. I like my ice coffee and the cute cup design that goes along w it.  Great for an IG post.  Can't wait to come back!"
Sightglass Coffee,"What you need to know before you go. 1. You'd be hard pressed to find better coffee, or coffee service anywhere. 2. They offer all the prerequisites 3rd wave coffee offerings. 3. The store is wonderfully designed with great seating options. Downstairs there's the coffee bar, stool seating along the front windows and community tables upstairs. 4. Beans are roasted and sold on site. 5. Great people watching."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is hands down my favorite coffee place. Beans are roasted here and at their Mission location. The coffee is so good. It’s the standard by which I judge all other coffee places.  The staff here is pretty diverse with some personalities more friendly than others. They do a great job of keeping the line moving while still being helpful to newbies who don’t know what to order.  They get their pastries from the best bakeries in the City-Neighbor Bakehouse, B Patisserie, and Piccino, so you can’t go wrong there.  Lastly there is no WiFi and no outlets here. So if you want to work here you’ll need to come with a full battery and your own WiFi source."
Sightglass Coffee,"Fantastic coffee, had a cortado. Milk was perfect temperature and texture, espresso tasted amazing. The baristas do a great job and they are very friendly and considerate. The pastries were also great from a local bakery. The space is also really cool. Lots of places to sit and lots of natural light. Bonus: they today beans right inside, cool to look at... Even better to smell. They have an affogato bar upstairs...."
Sightglass Coffee,"My friends took me here as I was touring and wanted to try the most hipster cafe in sf. Interior, atmosphere, taste all 100% satisfaction. One thing I loved the most was the raspberry hazelnut croissant — sooooo good. A little disappointment in the little seating arrangements."
Sightglass Coffee,"Probably the nicest coffee shop I've ever seen. But rarely seats available, the loft area is always too hot, and it's crowded. No chance to interact with the baristas or ask about the coffee. They're not rude, just busy. The coffee itself is hit and miss for me. I've never had a bad cup, but some are just a bit flat and boring."
Sightglass Coffee,One of the best coffee beans!
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass makes great espresso drinks, cappuccino seeped pretty wet but good nonetheless. Clean, modern, warm interior with lots of wood and open space. No wifi but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The service was friendly, but not too prompt. Excellent coffee, excellent decor, good service."
Sightglass Coffee,"Delicious coffee, great vibes! Love the warehouse theme. Friends weren’t fans of the music but I’m not picky"
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee is great, the notes come through strong and everything is fresh because they roast in house. The roastery has a bar around it so you can watch the process. Overall it's a great coffee shop."
Sightglass Coffee,"A very unique lofty/industrial environment for a coffee shop, where you can see different portions of the coffee process. I had a vanilla almond cold brew that ended up being $6 with tip, so it is on the pricier side but it was worth it in my opinion. The customers seem to be on the younger side, with many people hanging out upstairs either working at the large tables or looking down on the main room. The entryway has bike parking which I plan to use in the future. The only downsides I can think of is no WiFi or outlets, but that might help prevent people from camping out"
Sightglass Coffee,"The interior design is very cool and very now. The neighborhood is troubling. The espresso was almost disgusting, beyond bitter and more repugnant unfortunately;  I don't believe I have ever had an espresso that tasted so off.  The staff was mildly polite, a step up in San Francisco but still a ways from pleasant and welcoming.  I do not plan on returning."
Sightglass Coffee,"This review is for there service- A basic thing that a coffee established coffee business should be having is a ""Wooden Coffee Stirrer"". They had plastic everything but not a wooden stirrer. I was given a plastic straw to Stir my hot coffee!!? The straw literally melted in my coffee. When I went back asking for a better option I was given a plastic spoons and the staff were too busy to be apologetic about what happened."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sight glass makes great coffee, if you’re willing to pay the price for it. The location is ok if you’re already in the area but there’s is not a lot else down in this part of SoMA - so its more of a hub for local tech workers.  Now that my office has moved locations, I wouldn’t go out of my way to come back here, but a great coffee spot in general if you happen to be nearby already."
Sightglass Coffee,"The service is professional here and they do take their coffee seriously, but every time I've been here, I've been less impressed by the coffee than by the gorgeous, rustic, loft-like layout of the whole establishment. The two-tiered setup makes for great people watching and also gives you just enough privacy to have a business conversation or get some work done as you sit along the balcony inside. I'd be willing to give this place 5 stars if it had knockout coffee and wi-fi, but it's nevertheless worth a quick stop, either on your own, to meet folks for conversation, or to show friends visiting from elsewhere."
Sightglass Coffee,"Super busy and not welcoming staff. No one opened an extra line when there were 8 people in line. There were like 5 people working or more too! Boxes of shipments of the coffee are worked on right in the store next to the line. That was weird. Only almond milk alternative milk. No skim milk. Asked for extra hot and did not get it hot. Only Luke warm. Though I liked the coffee, the thermometer is needed to get the extra hot over your norm. Baristas cannot think they get it right unless it’s at least over 160 /170 degrees and when they guess at the temperature it can be wrong. To think they can without a thermometer is to be rebellious, arrogant and presumptive."
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee was good and the building is a really interesting space, large and with a second floor that also looks like there is a separate area for private events. Came during a very hot day, no air conditioning there and that could have made the baristas grumpy, cause they were not friendly and not willing to explain there drinks to someone that had never been there before."
Sightglass Coffee,"Biggest best Cafe for Coffee in San Francisco.  Better than Flore for coffee due to a singular focus on the utmost quality coffee cafe experience.  Quick Cup varies daily with prices from $2 to $3.25 and it is worth it.  Great ambience, huge yet cozy, sociable clean tech oriented crowd... But it is not all laptops... Lots of friendly hellos, shared tables, and good old pen and paper.  On site roaster.  Such attention to detail that I covet their paper towels at the wash sinks!  Where do they get those?"
Sightglass Coffee,Love the ambiance of the whole space. Great spot to sit down and get some work done. Got the vanilla iced coffee and it was aromatic with just the right amount of sweetness. Sightglass is definitely one of my favorite coffee places in SF.
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee is AMAZING  I can't emphasize this enough. Watching them roast then getting a pour over of their single origin coffee is something I look forward to every time I visit!  The atmosphere is bustling, there are lots of places to sit. Clean, well and sparsely decorated, open space. The cashiers are always friendly and kind when I come into town.  But mostly the coffee. This place is 5 stars alone on their coffee. If you like coffee... at all... come here and get coffee. Spend a little extra time and get a single origin pour over to really taste their genius...  But laté, Americano, cold brew... all great too!  Warning for food allergies: they know their coffee, but if you have food allergies you may want your meal elsewhere. They really couldn't confirm if I was safe eating any of their ""seasonal fruit"" or granola due to a plum and apricot allergy. ---Don't let that stop you though!! The coffee is just coffee, so that's all good! As long as you're here for that you won't be disappointed."
Sightglass Coffee,"I never want to leave this place, the atmosphere is so lovely. The coffee and scone are amazing. The nice young man that took my order was pleasant and he called me friend. This was my most favorite part of this SF trip. I'm not only leaving my heart in San Francisco, I'd like to leave right here. Here you go Sightglass, it's all yours ❤."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass has very great coffee! They have a free coffee cupping workshop on Fridays. There were 7 kinds of coffee that we could try. Although there isn't wifi and the space is kind of loud (they roast and package the coffee there!), it's still a very nice place to get coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,My favorite coffee place in San Francisco! I usually come here for couple hours of work. Love to seat on the second floor and observe baristas. Really great atmosphere here and always smells good since it is not just a coffee shop but also a roastery. The only odd - they don't have WiFi and no power sockets.
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and pastry selection. Sometime the lines get a little crazy out of control. You think they could come up with a bit better of a a system. The affogato bar opens late morning and is mind blowing. Decent meeting spot for friends or casual work rendezvous. Great selection of beans to take home.
Sightglass Coffee,What kind of cafe does not have WiFi????? That is all.
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is great, and the staff is always friendly. The space is wide and open, with a second floor that overlooks the first floor. They don't have wifi or outlets, but I think they have the right to have this café for socialization and ambience rather than for sticking a nose into a laptop for 5 hours."
Sightglass Coffee,Unique place i would say! very modern location and the design is superb! This place is super cool to go into!! I like how modern and tech savvy it looks. The coffee isn't the best but hey its just coffee. and if you want a quick bite to eat. come here and you will be able to get some good munchies.
Sightglass Coffee,"this is a great coffee shop, with excellent coffee and pastries.  The space is also really amazing and comfortable to work at.  You should be aware, however, that they do not have public wifi here.  So go in with that in mind."
Sightglass Coffee,Bright spacious place that seems like a good place to hang out or chill. I just got the quick cup to go which was decent and a pastry. I would come back for their other baked goods looked delicious. Service was fast and efficient; they use Square of course.
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass roasts their own beans and the coffee here is always delicious! The one thing about this place is that they don't have free WiFi, so you'll need to use a WiFi hotspot or just chill there with no internet (perhaps read a book or have a face-to-face chat!). Both their espresso drinks and pourover coffees have always been amazing. Cool atmosphere and ambience as well!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good espresso and cappuccino.  Cold brew is actually iced coffee, as described to me.  Like other roasters visited in SF, 8oz bag of beans is high priced compared to other cities.  Excellent space if you enjoy be submerged into all things coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,"Not a major coffee person so I can only handle their vanilla iced cold brew, but it's quite good for an afternoon pick me up!  Environment is also nice for working/relaxing/talking.  Hipster Level: not over 9000 but close."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great spot to grab a coffee. Friendly staff. Plenty of seating and light if you want to stick around and get some work done. They also have one gluten free pastry, an almond cake, that is delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,"The very best coffee shop in town - stunning design that mixes industrial lights, sparse wooden desks, hexagon print wallpaper and more, a delicious creamy latte for $4 and coffee to buy and take home. You can even bring your bike inside and park it. I love."
Sightglass Coffee,"A nice coffee place in an industrial environment. Good quality coffee, specially the bourbon brewed one. Interestingly, the coffee production was in open view to the customers. However, a bit massive, more the place to go alone, than to enjoy your coffee with a friend. Lacked a touch of coziness."
Sightglass Coffee,"Benchmark for what a good coffee house should be. Excellent seating options for groups or singles, airy atmosphere, and of course, great coffee. I'm not sure if they have WiFi (I don't think so) so I just tether my phone."
Sightglass Coffee,"The intoxicating aroma of freshly roasted/roasting beans is ever present. The space is lovely and inviting, and the staff is helpful. Service is quick and the coffee is tasty. What else do you need?"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, amazing space. Somewhere I'd happily camp out for an afternoon or arrange to meet at. I had a delicious Kenyan drip coffee. Not a varied enough selection on the food front - mostly sweet pastries and cakes that were on the heavy side when I would have liked to have more savoury nibbles."
Sightglass Coffee,"I guess you could call me a ‘coffee snob’, but this is one of my very favorite places in SF. Huge shop, great vibe, even better coffee. If you’ve never had their signature Blueboon Blend then give it a try and see what some of the best coffee should taste like."
Sightglass Coffee,Its hard to rank Sightglass lower than a 5 star. They are simply the best cafe in SF. (leave the tourists at BlueBottle on Mint) They take care when creating all their drinks and their roasts are well done. The ambience is excellent with roasting and packaging taking place right under your nose. Seating can be a challenge given its popularity. The food is passable.
Sightglass Coffee,"I met some people while waiting in line at another bakery and they told us to check this place out. It's basically a very spacious 2-story coffee/tea shop that has a nice view on the second floor. I wasn't planning on getting anything, but since we were here, I decided to get the everything croissant with cream cheese, smoked ham and gruyere morning bun, and a pistachio croissant with blackberry jam.  I didn't realize until afterwards that their pastries are made by Neighbor Bakehouse. All of the baked goods were pretty tasty, but I think they are known more for their coffee! Looks like a nice place to study or just relax and/or catch up with friends."
Sightglass Coffee,"Over hyped coffee place. It looks beautiful, but the coffee served was mediocre at best. There was so much pretension going on with tasting notes. I ordered a pour over Columbian for $4.75. I was expecting a fragrant coffee with deep natural flavors. There was a fragrant first sip, but that was the end of that. The rest was just a sour water. Too watery to call it a coffee. Temperature was low too. Pour over is supposed to be brewed hotter than regular a regular coffee, but it was warm/cold when I got it. They need to warm up the cup before serving or something. I was really excited to try their coffee after reading all the reviews. Overall, it was overpriced hype for a tiny portion of bad coffee, just like most places in SF.."
Sightglass Coffee,"I’m gonna go against the crowd here I guess. Not my kind of place. No public wifi, very little seating, and worst of all…..the coffee really wasn’t anything special.  When everybody has a micro-roaster on their block, you have really have to stand out otherwise you just get lost."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, very cool place. They roast all their coffee on site, you can watch them doing it. They make great coffee drinks & pastries; it's a huge place, with post & beam open space; 2nd floor seating as well."
Sightglass Coffee,"Being a former owner of a coffee shop, I love visiting independent shops whenever/wherever I travel. While in San Francisco I had heard about Sightglass and wanted to check it out. I was not disappointed as the service was excellent, the espresso was competition-grade, and the cappuccino was supurb. The ambiance and decor is unique and really gives the place a good vibe."
Sightglass Coffee,My favorite coffee spot in the city. They roast their beans onsite and the coffee they serve is super fresh. They don't use robusta beans so the coffee is not bitter and heavily caffeinated. For the quality of coffee it is much less expensive than other coffee shops in the neighborhood who do not roast their own. I go out of my way every morning for their coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"It's okay is a perfect description for this particular review.  I have now gotten Sightglass brewed coffee from Spiro Coffee enough times to have a real opinion on the actual coffee.  The first time I went, the coffee was awful (but it was stale and I couldn't blame the roaster for the shortcomings of Spiro).  Since this first experience, (which I must admit has skewed my perspective on the coffee, almost automatically making me more critical) I have tried the coffee a few more times.  It's okay. It has a bright and tangy flavor that some people love (my co-worker likes that fruity/winey/bright coffee), but maybe I just enjoy different tasting notes.  In purchasing 5+ cups of this coffee over the last few months, I felt that it warranted a review; but as I said in the beginning....it's okay.  Maybe just not my cup of tea.....or coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,Yummy coffee. Normally overpriced as usual for San Francisco standards. No Wifi but plenty of people with their laptop working and reading. A good spot to hangout and people watch on a sunny afternoon. Oh and there's an affogato bar upstairs. Give it a try. Pricey but delicious.
Sightglass Coffee,"Oh, Sightglass. What an amazing spot. The atmosphere is great, the coffee is great, the people are great. I love it. Came here almost every day during my last SF stay. Only bad thing about Sightglass: it makes ALL other coffee places seem kinda not-so-good."
Sightglass Coffee,"Walking into this place makes me happy. The energy exuded is comforting. The coffee is spot on (only almond and full fat milk options). Be prepared to wait a while for your coffee, as the barista treats each one like a creation of art. The wooden interior is beautiful and has a feeling of authenticity. There is lots of space upstairs to sit. Most people share large tables. It's a collaboration space, and can be noisy. There are no power plugs and no wifi. Nevertheless this place is a home to many working away on their tablets and laptops."
Sightglass Coffee,"Some of the best coffee you'll find anywhere, Sightglass is just world class. A veritable coffee conservatory, at once cavernous and cozy, filled with educated staff and thoroughly pleased (I'm quite sure) patrons. Just make sure to go upstairs to try their variety of single origin espressos - you can even go for an affogato for the price of most flat whites these days - and pick up a bag on your way out."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee. Very hipster. No AC, it has a greenhouse effect. Be prepared to sweat like crazy specially upstairs."
Sightglass Coffee,I come here almost exclusively for the affogatos (although everything is great). Head upstairs to mix and match single origin espresso with Salt and Straw ice cream. Try the salted caramel! Hard to find a seat because there are constantly people parked there all day on their laptops. Upstairs is also quite warm.
Sightglass Coffee,Great atmosphere and great coffee. The ability to see the whole roasting/grinding process next to ordering your coffee is unique. There's no wifi but that means it's a great place for meetings and offline work.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great spot for studying. There is plenty of seating but there are no power outlets. It gets quite busy towards the afternoon so if you are coming to study in a group, I recommend arriving earlier."
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee in the world! No comparison! When I lived in Amsterdam for 6 months, I asked visiting friends to bring me Sightglass coffee because it IS THAT GOOD.  No wifi here, but they won't kick you out for bringing your own. :)"
Sightglass Coffee,"Fantastic hip café with one of the best coffee I came across in SF. Affogato bar upstairs to make all your dreams with ice cream come true.  Delicious baked goods albeit being on the pricier side (as their coffee to be honest.)  You can see coffee getting roasted in front of you here and ask away any question you have around the topic unless it's super busy, due to all the hipster laptop-nomads occupying half the café staff are usually super chill though.  Simple, minimal and functional design & decor - I like it."
Sightglass Coffee,"If you want good quality coffee this is the place to go. I have been going to Sightglass since the opening, in fact even before that when they had just a counter (ironically, they have a counter now too because of COVID). Anyway, the coffee is always made to perfection every time it tastes as good as the first day. Thank you!"
Sightglass Coffee,"I love this place despite having no WiFi. The coffee is just impeccably made and their system is quite fast in getting your order even when busy. I wish their food had more variety, but the door they offer is very good. Price is a bit high but well worth it."
Sightglass Coffee,I was not impressed. The limited pastries and crafted coffee drinks did not impress me. It seemed that a lot of people who were there are not that friendly and are more concerned about their laptops or cellphones. The latte I had was way too acidic to be called a latte. The butter croissant was ok. The line was too long and the service was too slow given the fact that I do not mind waiting a while for coffee. I might give this place a second change. Might!
Sightglass Coffee,This is one of my favorite coffees in the city. The cafe itself is also really cool. It's all wood and there's a loft which serves as a good work space. Bonus: this location also sells Hooker's Sweet Treats. Yum.
Sightglass Coffee,"Some of the best coffee in town, but the real treat here is the cascara shrub. If you've never tried it and want a drink on ice, I highly recommend. This is a place for enjoying your drink and talking, but not working. No wifi and no power chargers."
Sightglass Coffee,best quality  coffee shop  ever been to
Sightglass Coffee,Very spacious place that you can hardly find in the city
Sightglass Coffee,Solid coffee and tasty desserts. Not the best espresso in turn but very good. I always stop in when I'm in the neighborhood. It's unfortunate that they don't have any cold brew or iced coffee other than some flavored/sweetened thing.
Sightglass Coffee,"I frequent speciality coffee shops all the time in the city, is this is my favorite place by far. The interior is minimalistic and incredible with high ceilings and great light. The espresso doesn't disappoint either!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing coffee here. Both their drip coffee and their espresso drinks are good. They have one of my favorite cappucinos in SF. The only downside is the lack of outlets or wifi, which make it hard to work out of this spot."
Sightglass Coffee,"I don't know what they did today  but I just had the foulest tasting mocha I've ever had in my entire life (not hyperbole). The interior and atmosphere are great.  I've previously had a decent cup of coffee here before,  which is why I'm not giving one star."
Sightglass Coffee,I live close by and don't drink coffee but I go to Sightglass often to get their very good and tasty hot chocolate. It is not sweet but it is certainly chocolate heavy as it is supposed to be.  My friend had a savory pastry with poppy seed that was good. It was as buttery as a croissant but in a different shape. I didn't have much of it so I don't feel like commenting extensively on it.
Sightglass Coffee,It truly does its best to impress Highfalutin coffee snobbery going on But that's what we pay for/-no? The place is gorgeously decked out in a wood finish The bathroom is marked WC to affect a European atmosphere but hey it's all good Too bad they are another of those wifi banning places
Sightglass Coffee,Love the atmosphere. Get yourself a cup of coffee and ask for nothing else.
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee in SF. It was a cappuccino from them that turned me into a coffee lover. Can't wait until they open up again inside to drink a cappuccino and read the news. Plus I miss the vinyl records they play in the shop.
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee all around. I'm a big fan of acidic coffee and they do it well here. The area is very conducive to staying around and chatting but the lack of public WiFi is a bit of a turn off for those looking to come out and work for a bit.
Sightglass Coffee,"My favorite place BY FAR for coffee. The atmosphere here is spot on and I love the industrial look and feel to this place. It's tucked in a somewhat sketch area, but to be honest, it's totally fine to walk to. If I could, I'd love to come here and work. Get their lattes!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Bright, open, airy warehouse-like space where you can watch your coffee beans being roasted. Nice for catching up. No air-conditioning so it gets hot in the day. No Wi-Fi so not great for work."
Sightglass Coffee,"Some of the best coffee you'll find anywhere, Sightglass is just world class. A veritable coffeeshop, at once cavernous and cozy, filled with educated staff and thoroughly pleased patrons. Just make sure to go upstairs to try their variety of single origin espressos - you can even go for an affogato for the price of most flat whites these days - and pick up a bag on your way out."
Sightglass Coffee,Really tasty coffee! While watching them roast the beans.
Sightglass Coffee,I have been driving by this coffee shop for a long time before finally deciding to make a stop just recently. And I can't believe I didn't try it before then. I ordered one of their best-selling espresso and it was definitely the best date I had.
Sightglass Coffee,"I often met with clients here for meetings over coffee, so I'd come here at least 2-3x a week. Here's what you should know: 1) Yes, those airplants are real. 2) The usually tidy bathrooms are unisex and don't have sinks, they're outside to be shared. 3) Seating is limited upstairs, so don't be afraid to share tables. 4) The counter along the balcony is great for people watching. 5) No wifi. 6) The Hooker's Mocha is my favorite espresso drink there besides the iced coffee. 7) They do offer vegan and gluten free pastries."
Sightglass Coffee,"When I lived in San Francisco, Sightglass was the regular Saturday stop on my bike ride. Ample bike parking. Beans roasted onsite (and what a spectacle it is to watch!) Ample seating on two levels. Excellent espresso, quite good milk based coffee drinks as well."
Sightglass Coffee,"Both the coffee and ice cream = 5 stars. Beautiful open layout. 5-star environment.  Must visit the affogato bar upstairs. The ice cream comes from Portland, Oregon. I am not usually a chocolate ice cream fan, but their chocolate ice cream is unique and amazing."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sick look and feel but no WiFi or outlets. Can't work, not even a choice. Pricey."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is great if you're a true coffee connoisseur. Their coffee is rich, creamy and features a subtle note of molasses. The lounge is beautiful, with an entire floor dedicated to rentable work spaces. Don't come here expecting Frappuccino drinks, Sightglass is all about love of coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,The vanilla paste latte is good. I wouldn’t recommend as a place to work because it is stuffy with no outlets and no wifi.
Sightglass Coffee,Sightglass produces great coffee. The shop definitely has a hipster/techie vibe to it. The decor is pretty cool with the open warehouse plan and you can watch them roast beans while you sip away. The shop serves premium coffee and the price reflects this.
Sightglass Coffee,"Really great place to get coffee, solid coffee beans and solid baristas who know what they are doing.  The ambience is great.  While it's a bit too deep in Soma, the space is awesome for people to linger for a bit.  One of my favorite places for coffee in San Francisco."
Sightglass Coffee,Very hip sightglass. Everything you would expect from a coffee shop. Lots of people socializing and working at the cafe with their coffees.  It's a bit warm on the second floor during the warmer days. A little too warm in my opinion.  They do have an affagato bar upstairs which is awesome.
Sightglass Coffee,"I'm not a huge coffee fan, but i loved the vibe of this place. it's basically the quintessential san francisco establishment. It has very rustic decorations and a lot of quirky little touches throughout the building. I like how they have a second level where you can get work done or just sit and look down at the operations of the place."
Sightglass Coffee,Best Coffee in my life.  The everything croissant was the most delicious thing I ate in San Francisco
Sightglass Coffee,"Cool space, good taste.  But Order your coffee and wait 8-15 minutes for it to be made.  No wifi.  And more expensive than any other coffee place in the city I've been too.  And not nearly enough seats.  No thanks."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee here. Their staffs were nice and it was nice watching them how to prepare your order. Liked their pastries too. The prices were reasonable.
Sightglass Coffee,My favorite SF coffee shop hands down. I would venture to say that this place should be a part of tours and in guidebooks. Such great coffee and such a unique cafe setting. Lots of seating to stay a while.
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee around this location (there isn't actually much available unfortunately). All the types of coffee one would want, from the typical espresso based coffees (latte, cappuccino - heck even a long black is understood and served), through the the cold drips, batch and normal filters. All in a trendy location for a price that doesn't quite compute unless you remind yourself of the location. This is San Francisco...."
Sightglass Coffee,"Overpriced hipster-esque coffee. Nice industrial warehouse layout and smelt really nice instead, but coffee was a bit bland for our taste. The cold brew with vanilla had a nice flavour but was way too milky."
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful open space, welcoming serene environment. Open no code bathrooms! Love it"
Sightglass Coffee,"5 stars for coffee. Had the vanilla oat milk latte- AMAZING. Friend had the americano. The chocolate/ blueberry scone and also the raspberry scone recommended- lots of fruit in them which I prefer. I really enjoy the coffee, pastries, and overall ambiance here.  Sit upstairs and overlook the first floor while you're chatting with a friend or putting in werrrkkkk.  Sit downstairs and enjoy the action of all the baristas or gaze outside the window and people watch."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee. Neat venue. Basically it's mildly inferior to the mint square blue bottle, but with more space and a shorter line. It costs a bit more per cup and doesn't have much in the way of food. Nice alternative if you just want to sit down with a coffee, but if you have the time I'd go to mint square instead."
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful space, good coffee, but the loft is exceedingly hot and tough to work in on a sunny day  and there are lots of hipsters. But at least I haven't gotten any attitude from the staff ever. :-)"
Sightglass Coffee,The baristas are unfriendly and the coffee is okay at best. The space is one of the coolest roasteries I’ve been in. It’s unfortunate that the don’t-give-a-f*** attitude still prevails in the specialty coffee industry. I work in coffee and I have seen good coffee served alongside excellent service. It’s possible. It’s just disappointing that it’s so hard to find.
Sightglass Coffee,"I have years of experience in roasting and brewing coffee and I do not have any affiliation with any company, local or remote.  Any good coffee shop should have something available before 7 AM. What they did have was incredibly acidic and overpriced. The drip coffee tasted like battery acid and rubbing alcohol. The espresso shots were stale and far too bitter. The largest serving size for drip coffee is 10 Oz which would be acceptable had it truly been gourmet.  I had hoped to try the variety on the menu such as pour over and pressed, but the garbage I drank was so far from enjoyable I saw no point in wasting money on more advanced brewing methods. There was simply no way to make a basic cup of this coffee tasteful.  The concept is admirable, being the coffee roasted on site with a variety of brew methods, but the execution is deplorable. It was a challenge not to give this another star since I want to support local roasters but until they can make a decent cup of simple coffee there is just no way I can give them more than one."
Sightglass Coffee,They have a wide selection of espresso drinks and also American style coffee.  If you are looking for beans they sell them too.  Beans are roasted in house.  Friendly staff! Great vibe.
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is a really fancy coffee shop - I'd come back if I lived closer to it. Their menu was somewhat confusing to me - lots of odd options I hadn't heard of (maybe I'm not hipster enough)... so I just asked for an americano and they obliged.  I used the cream from the condiments table - overall it was tasty!  The room has super high ceilings (like 2-stories tall), which gives it a cool feel - you can go up stairs and sit on a balcony-like area, which I did. However, it was really hot up there... we eventually got too hot and went down to the main area again to cool off."
Sightglass Coffee,Had the iced vanilla cold brew for breakfast. It was smooth and had no bitter aftertaste. A perfect way to start the day. Price was reasonable and the cafe had a bright open area.
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee here is amazing, no matter what you order! My bf gets the decaf, and even that is delicious! Plus all the baked goods I've tried were perfect as well. You can't go wrong with any choice at Sightglass!"
Sightglass Coffee,Very delicious hot oatmilk latte 💕☺️great service and seating …
Sightglass Coffee,"The space is pretty cool and you can see the whole operation...very interesting. Friendly staff and of course...the coffee was absolutely delicious. I would have to say it's one of the best latte's I've had in the city, if not the best...will definitely come back to this place every time I get a chance."
Sightglass Coffee,"The mocha I ordered was very dark and bitter, I was barely able to finish half of it. I love the Sightglass coffee that Piccino brews in the Dog Patch so I was quite surprised at the stark contrast. The location is quite large, but there is not much seating and no wifi or power available to customers, so it is not a great place to hang out or get some work done."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great light roast coffee, industrial style interior"
Sightglass Coffee,"If you're in the neighborhood, this is worth checking out. The space is cooler by a long shot than 4 barrel and ritual. They have this neat, sit-down coffee bar area upstairs where you can try things as espresso or using the Aero press. Also, I bought a bag of Ethiopian beans, which were at the same quality level as four barrel, but also slightly more expensive."
Sightglass Coffee,"I just had the worst experience here. I always like their coffee, but this morning I am on the go so I ordered a cold coffee, specifying ""no ice"". I waited for 5 min and the guy in the counter made ice coffee full with ice. When I requested for a redo the guy arrogantly said that this is the way how they make coffee and refused to redo. I cannot stand his attitude and requested for a refund. He claimed to be the store manager, and this is beyond what I'd imagine as a coffee store manager would do. People should be respected, and his attitude disgusted me. Oh, one more thing, when I requested a refund, the guy did not refund my original payment, which is credit card, but with cash. Very Sneaky."
Sightglass Coffee,Ordered the affogato that is made upstairs and told the barista that it was my first time. I chose the sea salt caramel ribbon and he recommended that I pair that with the Ethiopian coffee. Took his advice and glad that I did! The coffee was very aromatic and rich in flavor. Ice cream was from salt & straw! Very very sweet. Will definitely be coming back!
Sightglass Coffee,Big open space. Ideal for coffee meetup. Not ideal for WiFi and computer.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great specialty coffee. Lots of seating (two stories). It’s pretty fast service despite the long line. This spot is not only a shop, but also a roasting location, which is pretty sweet to watch."
Sightglass Coffee,"Gorgeous warehouse setting for this great coffee shop in the SOMA district of San Fran.  Soaring ceilings, exposed wood beams and lots of large windows give this place a very chilled vibe. There are several seating areas spread throughout the building including seats by the windows facing 7th St, a few seats by the front where you can see the roasters at work, at the back behind the main order desk and, finally, a 2nd floor ""loft"" with communal tables as well as bar-type seats overlooking the main floor.  Now, onto the coffee... I tend to like my coffee in the form of a double espresso or just a latte. And strong but not bitter and no need for fancy beans from remote locations or anything of that sort. Sightglass delivers.  They do tend to add a touch too much foam on their latte's sometimes - should be more creamy than foamy in my opinion - but that's a minor quibble. Their espressos can also be a bit milder than I like but, again, no major transgressions.  Finally, there is bike parking!!! My fave coffee shop in all of SF!"
Sightglass Coffee,Nice place mixing old style and modern. Coffee was good even if there was a little bit of Ethiopian coffee in my blend and I find it slightly too bitter. But you should definitely go!
Sightglass Coffee,Really like the multi level space. Thought the coffee was just okay slightly pricey
Sightglass Coffee,"Too loud. You can't have a normal chat without screaming to each other. Coffee is ok. Pastries are amazing (from B Patisserie) although they taste different than the originals - maybe they're one day old, or they change texture during the transport?"
Sightglass Coffee,No wifi ...🤔  Industrial warehouse vibes. Tight. But the upstairs is hot AF.  And really... no wifi 😑
Sightglass Coffee,"Customer service is okay it could use some work. Abieance of the cafe is extrodenary. I would say the café is more for looks than the actual taste. I ordered a double shot of espresso, it was over-extracted and a little on the bitter side. The esspresso was a bit grainy and the body was similar to water. Take this review with a grain of salt, it is possible that my shot was a fluke. In pulling a shot, there are so many variables that a shot can easily be messed up, such as tamp pressure and evenness, contact time, grind size, weight ect. Although the esspresso did not meet my expectations, my overall experience was better than usual. There is a lot of space at this location, and drinks come out quickly. I do have one question, why doesn't the roastery have Coffee Review rate it's coffee?"
Sightglass Coffee,"Interesting space with good coffee.  If you want to ""see"" more from a coffee shop than people typing away at their computers and a boring counter, you'll enjoy this place.  When I went, soy milk wasn't an option, but almond milk was."
Sightglass Coffee,"When they're roasting and grinding the smell is intense and the coffee is rich, fresh, and strong. It's a beautiful space to sit and meet or get some work done, but can be a little loud at times."
Sightglass Coffee,I was seeking an Americano Coffee closer to the EMBARCADERO area and came in for the first time today (based on the rankings). I was very disappointed with the 12oz to go being the only size for a little under $4. Limited choices on sugar (no artificial-Splenda) available. The ambience is great (the interior setup is hip-clean and plenty of room). Just wish the coffee lived up to the hype.
Sightglass Coffee,"Their large latte is more like a small latte at other places and very bitter. Poor service.  Unfriendly, they make customers feel unwanted and that customers should be grateful to be served. The place looks like a factory environment rather than a cafe."
Sightglass Coffee,Great space! And they have amazing caramels (from Hooker's Sweet Treats). The coffee is good but not my favorite. The bar upstairs is well worth it.
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass on 7th is one of my top 3 favorite cafes/roasteries in the City alongside Four Barrel on Valencia and Verve on Market in the Castro.  This location of Sightglass roasts on site, so there are a variety of beans to choose from if you're looking to purchase whole beans. The coffee generally is amazing, but their ""Quick Cup"" batch brew has never disappointed and always tastes up to par with higher priced pour over options that may take longer. Batch brew is my favorite determinant on the quality of coffee and the attention that the cafe puts into their offerings and Sightglass' may be one of the best.  Milk-based espresso drinks are also very well made and crafted with latte arts, though, that's not my forte or really my go-to drinks (I'm more a simple black coffee person). Soy and almond milks are available as well.  Variety of pastries and all are delicious!  Seatings can vary depending on days of the week and time of the day. Generally busy on the weekends where you may not be able to find a seat, but there usually are plenty, although you may have to squeeze closer to strangers than you may find comfortable. The second floor is great for gathering with friends as they have many larger tables and many seatings along with an Affogato bar and their ""cupping table"" set up. Second floor is usually hottter, though, due the heat emitted and rises from the roasting machine downstairs (perfect for the affogato!). This is a busy café with continuous traffic all day long, so don't come here looking to study/work and complain of the noise level. SFPL is on Larkins only a few blocks up, so go there instead.  Sightglass is one of the best in the SF roasteries scene. Definitely a must visit if you love quality third wave coffee along with a well designed industrial space."
Sightglass Coffee,"They don't answer there phone. When we got to the store at 1045 am on superbowl sunday, the guy making the drinks gave us attitude because we asked for an extra shot of espresso. He was being super rude and Told us we can wait 20 mins until he finished other drinks."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee shop with a cool atmosphere for catching up with a friend or getting work done.  Unfortunately there is no WiFi or accessible outlet so if you want to do work, bring a hotspot or do work you don't need internet for.  Also I think Sightglass coffee brewed at other locations is great, the coffee & espresso at Sightglass does not taste as good."
Sightglass Coffee,"All in all, I really liked this place. The coffee was great and the people were really nice. However, it was a bit too warm for me, but that's a personal preference. I imagine the temperature would be perfect for most people."
Sightglass Coffee,"It was good in the beginning, coffee and service are excellent. But lately they started to have some new workers that are lacking the motivation. Service is slower, laid back attitude. That buzz that I've experienced is gone. Maybe is time to go look for others coffee shop."
Sightglass Coffee,Perhaps the perfect place to get a good quality cup with ample space to enjoy people watching (especially from upstairs) One never knows just what adventures will unravel and there are a few nook and crannies you can retreat to should you simply want to enjoy coffee quietly calmly with yourself as company.
Sightglass Coffee,Pour over hipster coffee is quality. The upstairs loft has large tables you can work at with a group of colleagues. I couldn't find the WiFi password once upstairs though.
Sightglass Coffee,The decor on the inside looks cool like a mini coffee factory. It seems like a good place to read or hang out. I had their cappuccino and I was not a fan. It was kind of meh. There's a lot of workspace but no wifi and no outlets.
Sightglass Coffee,One of the countless hipster coffee shops in San Francisco where it takes a long time and a lot of love from a barista to get your coffee served in a mason jar. The coffee is good but one star less because they didn't tell you when it was ready and we waited on the wrong side of the bar.
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful space and excellent coffees. They take the open kitchen concept and apply it to coffee roasting. Roasting, packaging, etc... is all down out in the open. An assortment of fine pastries and an affogato bar round out the experience. A must stop for coffee lovers."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is possibly the best coffee space in San Francisco.. Good vibe, filled with light, good coffee, great place to meet, do some work, and enjoy a flat white. There are other places with similarly good coffee (possibly even better), but what makes sughtglass on 7th my favourite is the space itself."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, even for ones like me who aren't really in to the coffee trend. Very much a long the lines of Ritual or Four Barrel hipster coffee. Good selection of pastries to go with your coffee too. They also sell lots of coffee ""paraphernalia"" such as V60s, Chemex, scales, etc."
Sightglass Coffee,"Was very impressed with Sightglass! The pistachio croissant with jam was delicious and I had a drink that they created by using the cherry from the coffee bean, making it a syrup, then pouring it in with mineral water I believe. It was very different and excitingly tasty!"
Sightglass Coffee,Solid coffee and pastries but Sightglass shines in atmosphere. Two level roastery with interesting spots to hang out and enjoy a beverage.  Slightly smallish coffees for the money and no Wi-Fi are my only minor slights.  Cupping classes Friday at 3pm (haven't attended).  I'll likely swap between Mazarine (creative breakfast focused kitchen but small space) and Sightglass (pastries and interesting space).
Sightglass Coffee,Great pastries and even better coffee. Staff was helpful answering my questions about different beans. The space is really cool. WiFi would have been alright but I can't knock a star just for that.
Sightglass Coffee,"I have spent the last two years preparing expertise in fine pourover coffee, as it has become my favorite drink.  I consistently have to educate Starbuck's employees in over twenty Bay Area locations I regularly visit touring.  They hate me for pointing out the things you simply have to get right to get the most out of a bean into the cup you drink.  The old saying goes in the coffee farming business, ""I can pour my heart into the bean for six months and watch a barista blow it all in two minutes.""  Bay Area, your coffee is mostly marginal because that is the way of the industry that has served it to you for decades.  It was their profit intent, not your taste considerations.  Sightglass coffee has vaulted this barrier to entry to nectar nirvana.  I watched quite carefully as my brewista prepared his Hario V60 rig for brewing, and he was smooth, professional and highly intelligent about answering my questions, which I dialed into the level of expertise I was observing.  The only thing I regret is that I went with the Columbian instead of the Kenyan coffee.  Best for that bean as it was, it just doesn't have that flavor profile that sends me where I like to go when I pay premium prices for coffee.  Everyone there knew how good the coffee was, so the milieu was mellow and refined, unlike the scandalous snowflake vibe (you know the ""..ooh!  Two cats in this selfie!"" crowd)  you get in most places in the Bay Area.  Thank god I am one of the stewards of the original San Francisco Origin Comedy tradition.  Al lot of places would be much less cultured without comedians in general.  It's because we supply the truth you need to laugh.  Visit Sightglass, it's the truth.  No joke.  The Lone Comic _cirlceR_"
Sightglass Coffee,The staff stared at us the ENTIRE time that me and my friend were there. No WiFi. No plug outlets if you want to work. Nice architecture. Great space and clean industrial vibe. But they kept watching us like we were about to rob the place. : /
Sightglass Coffee,Good place for coffee. Nice environment with lots of seating.
Sightglass Coffee,"I love the space, and just hanging out here watching them roast the beans, and sitting upstairs under the skylights. The coffee is very good as well, although these days I usually just get the ""quick cup"" because... it is quick!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Definitely a good place for a quick cup of coffee, they are always fast with your orders. It does tend to get very busy and packed inside. I love their espresso drinks!! SUper good."
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee, great ambiance, and open layout. My one problem is they don't have plugs (intentionally?) and don't have wifi. Pro: People are there to chat vs. work. Con: A lot of people work there anyways so it just ends in a lot of frustration."
Sightglass Coffee,"This is a place to meet up with startup people. Lots of wood, high ceilings with a loft-like converted warehouse feel, and plenty of natural light. Coffee too. The quick cup is today's plain roast which will allow you to skip waiting for your drink to be made.  Two words: pistachio croissant."
Sightglass Coffee,I personally feel like Sightglass goes toe to toe with Blue Bottle in terms of quality and flavor.  I like to pick up some freshly roasted beans here to brew some of that goodness at home.  Friendly baristas and good coffee--what else do you need?
Sightglass Coffee,"Walk, talk, and drink coffee amongst the hipsters of SF.  I really enjoy watching them roast beans in this cavernous wooden box of a cafe.  The coffee has a lot of character but is not the highest quality.  Amongst the cool new cafe's however, this one probably has the best coffee (drip, at least).  Little bit of a European feel with WC on the bathroom doors.  Lots of natural light in this place, but no electricity and no wi-fi- so don't even think about it."
Sightglass Coffee,Did a tour of a few coffee shops in San Fran and this was by far my favorite.  Spacious and unique shop with a fantastic selection of single-origin coffees.  I had something from Kenya that was excellent.  Friendly staff.
Sightglass Coffee,"i'm not a big coffee drinker, but i absolutely love it here at sightglass. the last time i came, i got an almond latte, a chocolate raspberry scone (from b. patisserie) and an almond cake (also from b. patisserie). the latte was delicious, and of course the pastries were as well. i also just love the design and atmosphere at sightclass. i can see myself spending hours and hours here enjoying my coffee, reading a book and people-watching."
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee was""okay"" but warm not hot. Main issue was price and inflexibility. I ordered a latte with an extra shot. Told each pull was a double so I had to have a quad. I like strong coffee so agreed. Then paid twice - $9 for a latte!! #nevergoingback"
Sightglass Coffee,Great Iced Latte and nice spacious place to hangout!
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee in the city. Hands down. I love this location, great feel inside and plenty of places to sit and work upstairs. The pastries are lovely as well."
Sightglass Coffee,"There was no denying the bold flavor of my mocha and the layout/crowd of their cafe is a bit more serious than let's say Four Barrel, but it's a beautiful place to enjoy some seriously well roasted coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,"It's huge, it's well lit with natural lighting, and looks pretty cool as a converted warehouse.  However, it's really tough finding a seat here and the noise level is a bit high.  The coffee is alright and somewhat overhyped by the locals."
Sightglass Coffee,I agree that the atmosphere is cool and coffee os good but it makes ZERO sense that there are so many tables and ZERO outlets. It appears as if they put the tables there for people to work but then don’t facilitate that.... my mind is blown.
Sightglass Coffee,Awesome coffee and really cool atmosphere. Great mugs and vinyl playing. It's an open space so not too quiet when lots of people are there
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, hip space and a popular hangout spot. If you're doing a SF coffee tour, definitely worth a stop. One minor gotcha: no wi-fi. If you're planning to do some work on your computer, you'll need to tether to your own device."
Sightglass Coffee,"This location is huge. A bit off the beaten path but it is quite crowded. They are roasting the coffee right there on the ground floor. They have the main coffee bar downstairs but also two more upstairs. I have only see two open at a time so far. The industrial look works for me, it could get quite hot upstairs on a hot day as it gets warm as it is."
Sightglass Coffee,"An okay latte, nothing to rave about. Expected interior (rustic, modern lighting, Portland vibe). Humble attitudes running the counters. All in all, a good place to hunker down if you need a quick break. No WiFi."
Sightglass Coffee,"For all its beauty, glory, and good caffeine, they still don't have public power outlets :("
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee and nice atmosphere. It's nice to sit with a perfect latte watching the next batch of coffee roasting. If it were closer to where I live, I would be there right now!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing place with delicious coffee  Definitely worth a visit! The location is just great, feels really chill. And the coffee they offer tastes delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee in SF. Well worth the trip out. Set within their coffee roasting factory so you can watch the beans browning in the urn. Amazing pistachio croissant
Sightglass Coffee,"Bit sad to see it half open for seating, but very understandable as it keeps the food safe & sanitary.  The coffee & baked goods & matcha were all delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,"Had their Blueboon in a restaurant in San Francisco. The coffee left a lasting impression. Finally having dinner in another restaurant close to the roasting house and decided to stop by. It was a 45 minutes ride on BART from South bay and a short walk. The place is clean, bright, comfortable and very casual. People order their drinks and hang out; chat, read or doing work on their laptop. Unfortunately they are not serving Blueboon today so I tried the Kenya which was slightly on the bitter side. Will buy a bag of Blueboon beans to revisit that flavor."
Sightglass Coffee,One of my go-to coffee spots. AMAZING vanilla cold brew coffee and generally amazing coffee! The place itself is very spacious and is a great spot to post up and work upstairs.
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing coffee shop. Very authentic and very special. At Sightclass, you will have chance to observer the whole processes of making coffee. That's the meaning of this shop, bring coffee back to the old days. One thing to note down, there's no wifi here. So if you are looking for a place to work, it might not be the one."
Sightglass Coffee,"A fantastic place to get a cup of coffee and people watch. I particularly like an Americano and maybe a pastry or chocolate to go with it. They got their chocolate from Hooker's. Sit upstairs and watch all the VC/Tech peeps do deals. :) Their bathroom setup is slightly awkward, but this is about as hipster coffee shop-y as you can get."
Sightglass Coffee,"Located in South of Market (SOMA) it is a great place to get a local experience on coffee with great taste. Excellent fact: Square Wallet is used here. Behind the Coffee Bar there is a *Vinyl* Library and turntable (be shocked) Cool Points: On my first visit, Sight Glass had playing on Saturday morning -- Le Tigre's 'Deceptacon' ** (Don't act like that is not cool -- you won't hear them at Starbucks)"
Sightglass Coffee,The vanilla cold brew is my favorite. Great pastries too.
Sightglass Coffee,"Warehouse vibe, hot! no AC. Loud. $4 for an espresso. Came with selzer. Taste is of mild roast: sweet with a tint of acidity. One choice of herbal tea, but wasn't diy teabag! Paper cups for water... There is no WiFi but a bunch of Mac ppl hogging up limited table space. Overrated."
Sightglass Coffee,Lovely spot for a cup of coffee. They also offer baked goods. Big beautiful space with lots of woodwork. From the mezzanine you can watch coffee beans roasting.
Sightglass Coffee,"Delicious coffee, and a great atmosphere. Really tasty muffins. Not sure if they ever got Wi-Fi but when I was there some months ago it was still a Wi-Fi desert. Worth a trip for some coffee if you're in the area."
Sightglass Coffee,"The location looks really cool, and the coffee is ok.. but the staff consistently treat me as if they despise me.. on many occasions when simply just ordering coffee. Maybe I'm not good enough to be here? 😅 …"
Sightglass Coffee,The best coffee I know.  I go there frequently even though I always suffer from the hot temperatures of 80+ degrees due to the lack of ventilation and no air conditioning. But the coffee is fantastic.
Sightglass Coffee,"Super friendly staff, very willing to answer questions you might have while ordering. Large space and awesome atmosphere. The vanilla cold brew tasted great."
Sightglass Coffee,"COFFEE TOWN SAN FRANCISCO. This place is doing things right. Sort of a weird setup as far as where you stand to get your coffee, but awesome space, awesome tunes, great coffee, awesome baked goods. Pricey but worth it. You drink coffee in SF, you know the drill."
Sightglass Coffee,"Went while getting new tires on my car to work. Coffee, food, and ambiance were all good, just pretty loud to take any calls while there and didn't see any WiFi options on first glance."
Sightglass Coffee,"Very spacious coffee shop with more seatings in the second floor. Communal tables for ppl to sit at and chat. No wifi, though. But it's meant for ppl to enjoy company and coffee and pastries."
Sightglass Coffee,"It was a beautiful cafe with decent coffee, but important to know it does not offer WiFi and there is no access to any other options such as free City WiFi. If, like me, you’re after a leisurely Sunday morning catching up with news and emails, best look elsewhere unless you have a local data plan."
Sightglass Coffee,Brotherly love is what this coffee joint is all about. No sibling rivalry here.  The owners of Sightglass Coffee are two brothers Justin & Jared Morrison and I've had the pleasure of seeing them both in action on several occasions when they first began their 7th street venture. Justin seems to be able to make drinks like a pro and they've both been stellar(ly) pleasant and approachable.  I have since moved away from ease of access to Sightglass but if I were closer I'd be joining them for a morning coffee every weekday.  Keep it up fellas.
Sightglass Coffee,"Go to the Affogato Bar upstairs - they have single origin espresso. I'm a big fan of their SOE espresso - served straight with a soda back (the way it should be). The downstairs area only serves the espresso blend.  This  place has no wifi and is usually quite warm inside, but their SOE and friendly batistas are good enough to keep me coming back on the regular!"
Sightglass Coffee,"The smell of fresh roasted beans hits you as you walk through the large wooden door. Relaxed atmosphere, great coffee and you definitely need to try the chocolate and raspberry scones!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is the new leader in third wave coffee in San Francisco, though I still really like Four Barrel as well.  It's hard to tell exactly what Sightglass does differently, but the pour over was incredible.  The upstairs space is nice and though they lack wifi, you'll find a decent amount of startup people hanging out here."
Sightglass Coffee,"I love everything about these coffee purists. I don't even love coffee. The atmosphere is cool, but casual. No plugs on purpose. No WiFi. Just great coffee. Deal."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great place for a quick latte/ snack or to ""camp out"" for a bit.  Lots of natural light (though the upstairs can get somewhat warm as a result).  No Wi-Fi but if you have a mobile hotspot, no problem."
Sightglass Coffee,"Pistachio & Blackberry jam croissant was recommended by the barista taking my order as the best sweet pastry, and it delivered. Go sit up stairs by the railing overlooking the shop. No wifi, but a delightful place to spend an hour chatting or reading."
Sightglass Coffee,"This is such a fun place to take folks visiting the office from out of town, it has great coffee and a cool atmosphere. We sat at one of the bars and watched some coffee roasting. There was lots of instagramming. I'll be back again next week I'm sure."
Sightglass Coffee,Great cozy atmosphere and great coffee. They roast the coffee onsite and you can watch them make it. There is no Wi-Fi our outlets but it's a place to meet and socialize rather then work.
Sightglass Coffee,"One of the best in SF. I love everything about this place. The coffee (especially and I always order two flat whites in one visit), the atmosphere, the chocolate and berry scones."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, great atmosphere, friendly employees, lots of seating"
Sightglass Coffee,"Some of the best coffee in town, which is saying a lot. Never a lecture about beans or why you can't have ""that"" and everything on the menu is great. Pastry game is on point, from the buttery kouign-amann to the sweeter muffins and cakes. Staff are friendly and quick, and good at getting your order in, taking your money (via Square, because Dorsey) and handing you off to the barista. No fuss, no muss, no, ""Uh, do you give me my... wait, I'm supposed to have a number?"" silliness."
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is my fav coffee spot to visit when in SF. Good place to have informal business meetings, read a book, do some work, or just hangout w friends over super dope coffee. NOTE: there is NO WIFI which is odd so not a place to wire in for the day."
Sightglass Coffee,"So sad.  This used to be my favorite place.  Walked in.  No hello.  No smile.  Waited 20 minutes for my drink. Inquired. Told ""oh that's yours on the counter"". Made 15 minutes ago, they got my name wrong. No sorry!  No more."
Sightglass Coffee,I’m a coffee drinker. I drink from everywhere. But this is by far the worse tasting coffee I ever had. My kids didn’t even like their hot chocolate which I didn’t even think it was possible to mess that up. It’s expensive. Small. And slow.
Sightglass Coffee,"Friendly customer service, simple menu, rustic atmosphere... loved it!"
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee shop is integrated into the roasting operation which makes for a really cool environment. They don't offer much in the way of food, but this, in combination with being in SOMA, keeps the crowd just the way I like it -- a lot of remote workers."
Sightglass Coffee,Their vanilla ice is the bomb! They serve ice cream upstairs which is perfect for my little one. Staff is super friendly and service was quick. Can't wait to come back!
Sightglass Coffee,"I'm a tea drinker. I came here with a couple friends and when it was my turn in line I asked if they had tea. Guy said no, we don't have tea sorry. I said oh ok thanks.  Ps. 4 stars for how awesome the place is set up and for my friends saying the coffee is awesome... as well as the cool heart they made in the cappuccino. I'd definitely come back here just to hang out and read. Normally I love to try new things, but coffee is an acquired taste -  I wouldn't know how to appreciate this coffee vs instant coffee. 1 caffeinated addiction is good enough for me."
Sightglass Coffee,"Really cool hippy vibe and my favorite go-to place to grab a dependable iced coffee. If I feel like treating myself, I'll usually hike upstairs to the Affogato bar and order the Ice-Cream Coffee Float (with sea-salt caramel ribbon ice-cream!). Usually it's not enough coffee for me so I ask for less ice-cream or better yet, get a Cold Brew iced coffee and slowly replenish my glass as I'm drinking. Ahh heaven. Pretty busy on most weekends I've gone but there's definitely studying spots available if you're into pretending to study while really hoping that cute boy in the next table over would come and talk to you."
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is… well… sterile. And the staff, the three times I've visited a bit pretentious. Not sure why people get uppity about coffee, but there you go.    ////  Pros: Lots of space & light; interesting to look at    ////  Cons: That wretched light roasted espresso, so popular in SF; condescending, cold staff     ////  Meh: Baked goods"
Sightglass Coffee,"Third wave coffeehouse with a roaster on site. Excellent space, love the vinyl music, love the retail shelf.  Not a real fan of too light roasted coffee, but love the space."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great vibes. The atmosphere is superb and there are so many counters, I don't see there ever being much of a wait. Also good coffee of course."
Sightglass Coffee,Nice and spacious! No public wifi. Good espresso
Sightglass Coffee,"If you like Coffee, this is one of those coffee places you probably already frequent. The decour is rather spartan but includes a cute little plant in a glass dome and a great open area. The coffee was solid and the barista seemed to be knowledgable."
Sightglass Coffee,"Big open warehouse. Watch and smell the roasting process. Those making your coffee dance to fun music, answer coffee questions, are friendly and entertaining. Plenty of open space to work or have a drink"
Sightglass Coffee,I love this place! The have delicious coffee and pastries. But the environment is so great to chill out... work or meetings... dates... anything!
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee… some of the best tasted yet on our visit to San Francisco.
Sightglass Coffee,"Ugh...I live in SOMA and I have for two years. I live right on 7th and Folsom. In fact,  I could start a Square tab at SG from my house. The interior is beautiful and the coffee is above average yet, I've only been to SG four times. Why? ATTITUDE.  I swear to god, it's like they TRAIN them to be indifferent. Every time I go in, I get a different barista and the SAME attitude. It's amazing. I feel like apologizing after I buy a cup of coffee. I definitely don't feel like hanging out. I even went in one time to ask if they happened to see my cat (He got out), and I got a less friendly reaction. Weird.  NOW, the coffee is a different story. As far as artisan coffee is concerned, SG is EASILY in my top five. I'm a crazy Philz fan but, If I want really complex coffee and a GREAT experience every time...I go to Four Barrel. SG makes great coffee. It's just not worth the hassle or the cost.  Oh yeah, the chairs suck too.  ;-)"
Sightglass Coffee,"By far the best affogato I've ever had... sorry little Italy. That orange ice cream though... YUMMM!!!  The design is absolutely gorgeous, only down side is that it's soo hot inside specially if you sit in the upper level."
Sightglass Coffee,"Trendy place, very nice deco and apparent wood. Coffee is slightly expensive."
Sightglass Coffee,One of the best coffee shops in SF. They roast their beans onsite and rotate their coffee. Highly recommend the Guatemalan!
Sightglass Coffee,High quality and attention to detail. Nice atmosphere in central location. Well done
Sightglass Coffee,"Sightglass is a beautiful warehouse transformed into a coffee shop.  The industrial modern feel has SOMA written all over it.  The large tables on the second floor are perfect for studying.  They remind me of crafting and design tables used by architects, carpenters, and artists.  No wifi or power outlets makes for a much needed break from technology and social-media overindulgence.  The food selection is on the expensive side (small pastries start at $4.00 and up).  The coffee selection is sparse but quality.  Passion and specialization, how life ought to be.  Let your inner artist shine."
Sightglass Coffee,I'm in love with their vanilla cold brew. The coffee here is good and the pastries are delicious!! Really cool and urban atmosphere
Sightglass Coffee,"Honestly the best coffee in the city , and I love the variety of coffees they have from different countries, really shows the flavor  notes in each cup of coffee :)))"
Sightglass Coffee,"The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh.[18] By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea."
Sightglass Coffee,Meh. Another pretentious coffee place.  The coffee is fine but its really nothing special compared to all the great coffee places in San Francisco. The cold brew is worth the money. TBQH - Phil'z is better.
Sightglass Coffee,"The most hipster coffee shop I've had the pleasure of visiting. This is where I went full urban with my Macbook, latte, and business plan for a startup. I love the coffee here too."
Sightglass Coffee,Cool place. Coffee is too bitter. Extraction temperature is too high for the medium roast coffee beans.
Sightglass Coffee,"A very nice place to hang out, study, write, focus and meet new people.  In the heart of SoMA, this is a pretty good spot and just 2 blocks from the Powell street Bart station."
Sightglass Coffee,Great design great coffee love that place. See the coffee in action
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is always rad, but last time it was extra-rad because one of the baristas spent about 20 minutes with me, giving me all the info on how to do pour-over.  He was super generous with his time and now I totally kill it at making pour-overs at home.  But I'll still come in."
Sightglass Coffee,"Hip place in the middle of Soma. Great ambience and good coffee. Beware: they use only whole milk and soy milk, no other choices are available. Not much food to choose, just few pastries.  No WiFi here as well."
Sightglass Coffee,"Not sure how this could be any better.  Coffee roasting on site.  Two levels of plentiful seating.  Sweet and savory, gluten and gluten free treats. Cool but accessible ambiance.  It's all going on here."
Sightglass Coffee,"The staff here is super rude and unfriendly. Will not accommodate any additions or requests for your drink. Can’t order a triple shot espresso, only a double and a single so it’s pricier but whatever. What got me was that they literally wouldn’t even put them in the same cup even though I was fine paying the price of 2 separate drinks 😂"
Sightglass Coffee,"An SF coffee destination. Top baristas serve world class coffees here. The upstairs can get a little bit too hot to work in, but there is usually plenty of seating."
Sightglass Coffee,I've been a big fan of SightGlass and have become even more of a devotee now that I work just a few blocks away. The experience is what really sets SightGlass apart from its fellow designer coffee dealers.No barista judgment. Upstairs area looks like it'd be a great place to work too.
Sightglass Coffee,cool atmosphere. if you're willing to pay roughly $5 for coffee you might as well splurge here. they don't have outlets so bring your stuff charged.
Sightglass Coffee,"Good ambiance, great coffee, very nice servers. Missing; power plugs, WiFi. But I understand that if they offered them, people would stay all day and just spend 10 bucks."
Sightglass Coffee,Some of the best coffee in San Francisco. A bit pricey but worth it.
Sightglass Coffee,"After a particularly awful coffee at the hotel buffet, it was a relief to find our first real coffee since arriving in America. Very Melbourne decor, drinkable coffee. Antipodeans, this is for you."
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is always rad, but last time it was extra-rad because one of the baristas spent about 20 minutes with me, giving me all the info on how to do pour-over.  He was super generous with his time and now I totally kill it at making pour-overs at home.  But I'll still come in. Like"
Sightglass Coffee,"I went out of my way to visit this place, so it was disappointing to find its drip coffee so watered-down. The barista that served me seemed to want to go home already and warned that the pourover would take quite some time, although I asked for it"
Sightglass Coffee,"Clean, lively space and an easy coffee menu to navigate.  Great spot to get some emails out before heading into the office or meetings."
Sightglass Coffee,Seems like a place to do startup business.  Meetings with computers everywhere.  Slow drip coffee in the fashion of Philz or Blue Bottle.  Lovely wood tables in a stark concrete open atmosphere.  Nice staff.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great space, excellent coffee, delicious affogatos."
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent espresso and really cool feel to the place. Love it how you can see the roastery in action
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful room, i felt my Cortado Hondorus beans were a touch under developed for the espresso shot I ejoyed it but I noticed that.    but everytime ive had drip from Sightglass ive been impressed and enjoyed it"
Sightglass Coffee,Classic coffee spot - grateful to have this place in the neighborhood. Excellent drinks
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent drip coffee with free refills if hanging around. That’s what you call a good deal.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, tasty pastries, industrial chic decor, and very friendly staff. Perfect for both hipsters and those who scoff at them."
Sightglass Coffee,"The 20th and 7th Avenue coffee shops are both friendly and have a delicious selection of savory pastries.  It's not cheap coffee, but it can be very tasty."
Sightglass Coffee,"This place is huge! A lot of tables, cozy design, own roastery and even manufacture right in the one place. Black coffee is incredible, highly recommend."
Sightglass Coffee,I think this place could have easily been 5 stars if they had wi-fi. I didn't understand why there were so many people working there but I guess if you have your own personal hotspot I would go here too. Great coffee and atmosphere.
Sightglass Coffee,Very cool place and great watching the beans being roasted. NO WIFI. REALLY in this day and age.  coffee was good but not the best I have had in SFO.
Sightglass Coffee,Excellent coffee. Fun atmosphere in both locations. Recommend checking out if you are a serious coffee drinker.
Sightglass Coffee,My favorite coffee shop in the city. Great coffee with an industrial/rustic vibe
Sightglass Coffee,"A mecca for fashion and design nerds in San Francisco, Sightglass is an impeccably designed coffee shop with much more to offer than fancy Hario V60 Drippers. The staff is friendly, the space is beautifully lit with natural sunlight, and the aroma is strong enough to persist on your clothing when you walk out. The coffee itself? Some quality drip from some fine baristas. Sightglass has me sold."
Sightglass Coffee,"This coffee shop epitomizes the new age San Francisco. Tourist or local, it is a must go to whether coffee with a friend or working on your MacBook. Get the pistachio powdered sugar crossiant with blackberry jam. Jaw dropping good!"
Sightglass Coffee,"EVENT: catch up with the guy friend - you know... boys have feelings too... lol jk! A great place to chit chat for hours... yes... I'm one of those people who sit around for hours and hours... at a coffee shop... for a catch up! DRINKS: Affogato - Dude.. you know me... from Melbourne, Australia... and we LOVE of coffee.. and one of the things  I miss so much is affogatos! And when I found out I can get it here... DUDE! I'm ON IT! So, basically affogatos - ice-cream with a shot of espresso! Pretty interesting here - you get to pick your espresso AND your ice-cream... this is pretty fancy compare to where I'm from! So, I got the salted caramel ice cream and a shot espresso (can't remember which one I got) LOVE how the ice-cream just melt over time and your coffee gets sweet. Great dessert coffee! **OVERALL - Must get... affogato is the way to go!"
Sightglass Coffee,The pastries and coffee were both great. Also the server was super friendly. Pretty cool place to have a quick bite.
Sightglass Coffee,"An experience. Coffee is delicious and setting is perfect for reading or a conversation. Cafe is on the pricier side. Tons of seating, pastries, no wifi."
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice vibe. Only problem is that they are a bit, how should I phrase it, weird. I mean who does not carry a sweetener these days and give you sugar and agave only. There is only so much you can do to show yourself off as a hip."
Sightglass Coffee,"Love the space.   Open, and spacious with exposed wood and metal.  Excellent coffee too.  You pay with Square - fast checkout and friendly service."
Sightglass Coffee,"Awesome coffee, but ambience is reason you wanna come to this place."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee. COLD pastries. Guess you're supposed to swish them both in your mouth, hot and cold... q: ""Is there any way I can have my (~$7) mushroom tarte flamme heated?"" a: ""Oh, no, we don't do that."" 👍🏼☺️ K, Great! Thanks! - guess I should go find a Starbucks, cus my phones on 3% -"
Sightglass Coffee,"Great concept, interior design. I was not impressed with the coffee, quite acid, and just warm. The staff attitude is not the best and they don't offer wifi service. Snobish place."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great, expansive cafe with pastries and delicious coffee. They don't take names so make sure you listen for your order -- it may come up on either side of the circular counter."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great vibe, huge space, coffee is delicious"
Sightglass Coffee,"What a great coffeeshop in a beautiful, industrial space. Love the Owl's Howl (their espresso blend) - it's beautifully smooth, lightly sweet, and not particularly acidic."
Sightglass Coffee,"Really great place for a good and tasty coffee. I really like the place, hisgh ceilings and big windows. They take care of all details."
Sightglass Coffee,Wow! By far the coolest coffee shop ever! Service was great and the coffee was amazing! Absolutely love the style and decor!
Sightglass Coffee,Great place with an upstairs. Great for studying or casual coffee.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great space and coffee drinks. They didn't have any soy or almond milk for those who are lactose intolerant, but coffee is good enough you don't need it."
Sightglass Coffee,Iced coffee was delicious and perfect amount of sweetness. Music was atmospheric and good volume. Only downside for me was dim lighting.
Sightglass Coffee,"Fantastic coffee shop located in SOMA. Quick and great drinks, this place is always busy but you can almost always still find a seat."
Sightglass Coffee,Cool looking cafe with in-house roaster. Think the price per pour over cup at $5.25 is too much. Small bag of beans at $22.
Sightglass Coffee,"Not hot, small portion, bitter, and very overpriced ($7 for a small regular coffee). Nice location though."
Sightglass Coffee,This is a local coffee shop in downtown San Francisco. I believe the place roasts their own beans. We will go back there again in our next trip to SF.
Sightglass Coffee,"Nice people, cool atmosphere, clean bathrooms. Coffee is on the more expensive side, but high quality. The everything croissant is delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,"Cool environment, coffee isn't bad but cafes like this are a dime a dozen in SF. Really tough to find seating and no wifi for whatever hipster reason"
Sightglass Coffee,Was there with my friends. And what can I say.. This is very cozy place with nice stuff and which more important really great coffee. Thanks for really stylish place pond good atmosphere.
Sightglass Coffee,"Such a nice smell of coffee in this place. Super clean, nice coffee and yummy pastries. Also nice to seat down and work / study."
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee, hipsters, macbooks, iPhones ... what more could anyone in soma need? Even though I do not drink coffee I end up here a few times a month with coworkers who need the extra pick me up. They claim its the best coffee in the city, but I have no way to judge that."
Sightglass Coffee,+) The atmosphere here is very good and it is also good for working. - ) I sat on the second floor and it was too warm.  $4 for a small coffee with no Wi-Fi offered :|
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee at a pleasant cafe!
Sightglass Coffee,Good Coffee and crossaints
Sightglass Coffee,"Good coffee, but way over priced. I know this area is a fan but I don’t get it. The space is good for business meetings but gets crowded and hot quick."
Sightglass Coffee,"Really cool coffee place. The smell of roasting beans is worth a visit. Good iced coffee, though a little on the small side"
Sightglass Coffee,"A big roastery, with a coffee bar right in the middle of the operations. Italian style espresso. There's plenty of places to sit, but Sightglass is pretty popular and during the morning it can get packed."
Sightglass Coffee,The coffee was great if you could get past the pretentious air of atmosphere and the snarky comments from your Barista (cashier) but other than that it was amazing experience. That cappuccino was perfect!
Sightglass Coffee,the food here is decent.  the coffee is really good.  this is due in part to the low levels of acidity.  there is nice seating and wifi available.
Sightglass Coffee,"liked the pastries and coffee. Nice place to get some work done, but they do not have any outlets so you have to come with your electronics fully  charged"
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee!  Nice atmosphere!  Service was Meh!  However there is no WiFi and no power for your computers or devices.
Sightglass Coffee,This place is really great! The vibe is awesome! It’s a great place to get some yummy coffee and to come and get some work done as well! The pastries are really great as well!
Sightglass Coffee,Great rostery and coffee shop! Fantastic cappuccino s and good cookies. The ambiance is rustic and cool.  Very bike friendly
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is great, I've been there many times. However, I always feel weird smell in this place, and the interior looks so shabby."
Sightglass Coffee,"My fav coffee shop, great coffee, great pastries, no wifi."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee.really great.but customer service kinda sucks.not saying they need to be kissass and all fake smiling but cant be grumpy and have a face either.thats my experience every time i get coffee there.bummer
Sightglass Coffee,Beautifully-designed place with good coffee and pastries. Can be slow but great for working with a laptop if you have your own wifi hotspot (no wifi provided)
Sightglass Coffee,"Good and dependable coffee. If you ask nicely, you can get freshly roasted coffee. Their Kouign Amann is to die for. Seating may be limited due to popularity."
Sightglass Coffee,The latte I'm currently dining is one of the smoothest I've ever had the pleasure to drink. There wasn't a lot of choice of food though. Staff were friendly.
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee is good. Space is better. People watching is the best. And if you're lucky, you'll get to pet someone's adorable dog outside."
Sightglass Coffee,The lack of wifi and electrical outlets is compensated for by the atmosphere and the incredible coffee. Beware that upstairs can get hot and muggy in warmer seasons.
Sightglass Coffee,No customer restroom or wifi. Music too loud and not good for a coffee shop. Crumbs all over the table. Very sad!
Sightglass Coffee,"Amazing coffee and a beautiful building. Remote workers beware, sadly there is no WiFi here, but it does make for a cosy spot to get some offline work done."
Sightglass Coffee,Very knowledgeable baristas and an unmatched atmosphere. Extremely unique place.
Sightglass Coffee,"Solid coffee, great warehouse setting.  A lot of startup folks around. No wifi or outlets, so come powered up if you plan to work here."
Sightglass Coffee,This is one of the best coffee roasters in SF.
Sightglass Coffee,"Ambience is awesome, the coffee is renowned but a little burnt in my opinion. There’s no WiFi but everybody’s on tethering."
Sightglass Coffee,Overpriced coffee and offer no wifi for some reason…
Sightglass Coffee,This particular branch is my favorite! I came here for the Cupping session and it was great. Very informative. Coffee also tasted cool
Sightglass Coffee,What a cool place! There is a second floor go up there and hangout. If you are walking in the area looking for a cool unique place...this is it. Make sure you thank my review when you discover how right I am ;)
Sightglass Coffee,Our favorite coffee place in SF! Coffee so good I sometimes buy beans and gift them to out-of-state friends.
Sightglass Coffee,"Really good, i love the smell of this place and here is really chill"
Sightglass Coffee,"Premium coffee and pastrys with prices to match, but the quality is exceptional. Extra points for great music too (Nancy Sinatra and Portishead)."
Sightglass Coffee,Large coffee place with excellent pulls and an extra bar upstairs you can order from.  The place is large and they use the space quite well.
Sightglass Coffee,"I really liked the atmosphere. It was very spacious and clean. I had a cappucino. It was delicious. It's kind of in a random street, but it was worth the visit."
Sightglass Coffee,As a visiting guess from New York. This was the only place I didn’t find the staff outwardly friendly. They were not rude just not focus on customer services. The foods ok and the had a limited selection of both food and drinks.
Sightglass Coffee,my favorite coffee place in SF. extremely well designed space; loft like with good atmosphere; coffee is good; no wireless though. i like their iced coffee
Sightglass Coffee,Vanilla bean cold brew is smooth and light. An clean industrial open atmosphere and farm factory type feel. Highly reccomend
Sightglass Coffee,Interior and exterior design are key to an environment engulfing coffee connoisseurs from all over the bay area. Some of the best coffee in the states money can buy.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee and service, average cookie, amazing place. A lot of space allowing you to be comfortable even if the place is crowded."
Sightglass Coffee,Good espresso. Nice indoors area. The roaster is very impressive.
Sightglass Coffee,Great place to get a bit of work done or just sit.
Sightglass Coffee,"Cool SOMAfied, SF place for coffee if in that area.  Probably the best place to hang out if you have any business while waiting closest to 850 Bryant St."
Sightglass Coffee,"I loved Sightglass. The space is amazing, very open with a great atmosphere. Our coffee was delicious and the service was great. Loved this establishment."
Sightglass Coffee,I've never had a subpar latte here in 10+ visits. The atmosphere is great and there's usually room.
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee. Quality of execution is consistently high. The staff is consistently warm and will recognise a usual face.
Sightglass Coffee,"Best coffee shop in the city. Excellent espresso, pour-overs, etc in a two story open space with tons of room to hang out."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee and pastries. The everything croissant is a must. Second floor is a nice little spot to people watch too.
Sightglass Coffee,Best Afrogatos (espresso + ice cream) choices served by knowledgeable and friendly baristas. Worth the side trip each and everytime I visit the Mission.
Sightglass Coffee,My favourite cafe in SF! Lovely staff and amazing coffe.
Sightglass Coffee,An amazing building with amazing coffee!
Sightglass Coffee,Amazing ambiance and even more amazing coffee :) Love their Almond milk latte. Tip - There's an Affogato bar upstairs with Salt + Straw ice cream :)
Sightglass Coffee,The staff is so fun and friendly. They really care about your experience. The drinks are unique to their tastes too which makes for an authentic experience.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great vibe, open space & awesome food. Latte was good (not great, hence 4 stars). Staff are really friendly!"
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee.  The beans they used a bit on the sour side.   On the second level they have classes on how to make coffee.  Lots of people here with their laptops - working?
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good coffee. Cool atmosphere, great crowd, nice staff. Good luck finding parking. NO WIFI!! 🤔 …"
Sightglass Coffee,I'm not a big Starbucks drinker I'm more into speciality coffees my favorite was drift away coffee but after trying sightglass it's my new favorite it's a little more expensive but their roasting skills is amazing.
Sightglass Coffee,Great quality coffee - both in beverage quality and coffee quality. The baristas are quick and there's good space to hang out.
Sightglass Coffee,"Really cool shop. Very open feel and the staff is really nice. The coffee is amazing, as well as their hot chocolate."
Sightglass Coffee,The coffee is great but the pricing on a quad shot is not equilibrated since it is the same to buy two lattes for ~8 usd than the quad latte itself.
Sightglass Coffee,Love the open space with lots of light. Good to do work (didn’t see any outlets) but also good place to people watch :)
Sightglass Coffee,"The coffee is fantastic, the experience is nice and clean. I'm particular about my coffee and this is some of the best I've had."
Sightglass Coffee,Thoughtfully prepared and roasted coffee and interesting pastries. I've been going here for many years and the quality is always consistent (and very high)!
Sightglass Coffee,"Coffee has great flavor. Sumatra is good, blueboon is amazing."
Sightglass Coffee,"Fab. Lots of space, good coffee, great for working. Mix of standing tables, bar seating and big communal tables. Wood and metal, industrial chic."
Sightglass Coffee,The original sight glass. Third wave coffee at its best (in a wonderfully rustic-industrial setting). Sip your espresso on the mezzanine looking at the giant roaster.
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee and nice place to stop. Only thing is be aware there are no outlets or Wi-Fi, but still worth the stop"
Sightglass Coffee,"Excellent coffee, roasted in house. Expensive but no more than other places in SF"
Sightglass Coffee,Good Coffee.  Limited menu of premade baked goods. No WiFi. Metered street parking costs 5 cents a minute.
Sightglass Coffee,"It's hard to describe what make this place so unique, indeed the coffee is great but the vibe is even better. Great place!"
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good cappuccino, might not be the best but in the top 5.  The pastries are fantastic, pistachio croissants are so flaky and yummy"
Sightglass Coffee,Just moved from Portland and Sightglass is my coffee oasis from all the burnt tar coffee everywhere else. Get a pour-over or an espresso and enjoy the beautiful space.
Sightglass Coffee,Parking is problematic but the service is great.
Sightglass Coffee,"A cafe trying to be something it's not. Go to Blue Bottle, where the service is friendlier, and they don't constantly get your coffee wrong, or give you lattes instead of flat whites."
Sightglass Coffee,Good coffee in a beautiful space. It’s unfortunate that they are often understaffed and takes 19 minutes to make a latte on a Friday morning!
Sightglass Coffee,Great spot for coffee but unfortunately they don't have tea (I know it's a coffee place...). Also second floor gets kind of hot.
Sightglass Coffee,"Beautiful space. Big enough to bring a laptop without feeling bad. Make sure it's a MacBook through, or you may be subject to bullying : )"
Sightglass Coffee,Beautiful space with well-sourced and well-made coffee. Great place to hang out for awhile and enjoy the scenery.
Sightglass Coffee,"A huge space to stop over for great coffee! They roast coffee beans by themselves, which looks really nice and smells good."
Sightglass Coffee,Great place! Serves very good coffee. Friendly and amazing atmosphere inside.
Sightglass Coffee,Nice coffee place if you want to work all day and get good quality espresso drinks...the pour over was just okay though
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good coffee in a very nice space. Staff is typical third wave coffee, which is to say trendy and reasonable."
Sightglass Coffee,This cafe does NOT have wifi
Sightglass Coffee,"Great coffee, good pastries, well-appointed space that would be conducive to getting work done, but for the distinct lack of Wi-Fi and power outlets!"
Sightglass Coffee,"If you ever want a great coffee shop to just post up with a book, this is your spot. Great open spaces, good people watching, and great coffee."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great smooth drip coffee. Could do for a more quiet space to work or have a meeting, but this is also a working roasting joint so I understand the lack of space."
Sightglass Coffee,The interior design of SightGlass Coffee is worth the visit. Enjoy the presence of wood over a well-made coffee. Zen.
Sightglass Coffee,Really high quality coffee. It’s a little loud but it’s roomy.  Makes me not want to go back to Starbucks.
Sightglass Coffee,Ok I was excited to come work here because I've heard good things but they don't have any power outlets. This is clearly a working cafe so not sure why this was the case.
Sightglass Coffee,"Very good coffee. If you don't like ""fast"" coffee this is a very good option. Very beautiful industrial design on the inside."
Sightglass Coffee,Immaculate vibes but no wifi
Sightglass Coffee,"This was an excellent cafe to stop at, a real find and very friendly and helpful. Great range of filter and speciality coffees."
Sightglass Coffee,"No wifi, No outlets, very very little seating.  Otherwise the place is great! Great atmosphere, great coffee, and great bakery items."
Sightglass Coffee,One on the best coffee in SF!
Sightglass Coffee,Huge fan. I love my vanilla cold brew. Great atmosphere and lots of space for talking or doing work as well.
Sightglass Coffee,"Our fave coffee place in town. Spacious, different levels and great pastry."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great ambience and coffee. Try the vanilla iced Almond milk cold brew. No Wi-Fi, but Xfinity works now."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great, local coffee in town. The atmosphere is very industrial feel with a modern twist."
Sightglass Coffee,"Great roaster with great coffee. Their cold brew could be improved, but pour-overs and espresso is on point."
Sightglass Coffee,I’m a big coffee lover and as you walk into this place you can tell that yr not the only one ☝🏽 Such an awesome spot Great coffee study/work friendly And cool staff Check this place out 🤟🏽
Sightglass Coffee,A great place for cold brew coffee and relaxing. The employees are nice and they have lots of wall bike racks.
Sightglass Coffee,Best coffee shop for study. Roomy with lots of seats at the second floor. Great espresso and roasting coffee show.
Sightglass Coffee,"Hip decor. Nice tables. So so coffee, no wifi and no power outlets. Staff attitude is not too friendly either."
Sightglass Coffee,Great coffee shop and roaster. I always like to come here for some smile and relaxation.... and great brew of course.
Sightglass Coffee,Coffee is pretty good but for a $5 plain cold brew the cup size is pretty small :\
Sightglass Coffee,"Excellent coffee. The pour over method employed here provides a delicious, and enriched flavor profile for every sip."
Sightglass Coffee,Nice open place. Coffee preperation is good. They actually keep sacks filled with coffee beans at the back of the place. Pretty neat stuff.
Sightglass Coffee,Delicious coffee roasted in house. Lots of bike parking and plenty of space to sit and socialize or work or watch the coffee being roasted!
Sightglass Coffee,"Sunday morning down Seventh Street San Francisco, this popular but basic coffee shop roast their own coffee on site."
Sightglass Coffee,I did not find any plugs and the coffee is a bit pricy.
