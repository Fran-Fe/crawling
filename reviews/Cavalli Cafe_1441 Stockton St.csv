Cavalli Cafe,"An authentic cafe!  We had craving for dessert and luckily we were right by this place. We were really surprised by the food and great service we got here. Fresh and delicious tiramisu and cannoli which you can never forget. This place has this atmospheres of an italian cafe which adds up to whole experience. People were really having good time here. And the prices are just right.  Do go if you are around, stop by for coffee or dessert, look no further…!  Note- cannoli is a must try!"
Cavalli Cafe,"Drove past this place and thought the exterior was so cute, so we braved through finding parallel parking to stop by. The people who work here were so nice and helpful when I asked questions. We loved the desserts and coffee that we got. Would definitely recommend if you’re in SF!"
Cavalli Cafe,"Charming place til it’s not. Employees not super nice unless they think you’re rich- much like many places here. I put up with it I noticed the sign by the bathroom. Don’t think it’s funny at all. Upstairs has very little airflow. Even though it’s close to where I stay I will not be back. Be prepared to hear the same music on repeat … and by the way, Stella coffee across the street is kind to everyone.. at least as far as I have seen…"
Cavalli Cafe,Relaxed yet classy. I went solo for a pick up. Chose a mocha & Tiramisu. WOW!THE BEST! thick foam head on mocha in a  8oz Mason jar-  The Tiramisu  slice was generous &  moist throughout!  And for extra fun:  the many coffee themed mini signs on the high walls kept me entertained. ...One more perfect part: A handsome friendly barista/front clerk!
Cavalli Cafe,"It’s sad when one bad interaction is enough to ruin a long relationship. I’ve been coming here for years as I live around the corner. The coffee is awful and grossly overpriced, the food is wildly sub par, and the pastries are soggy. I didn’t care, as It was close to my house and they are open late - call them quirks of your standard bad cafe.  Today I sat down to have a coffee and work, and while doing so, I bent over to tie my shoe, and as I have chronic back pain, I used the plastic seat at the table to support my foot. An employee ran out and rudely began to berate me for placing my foot on a seat. He then proceeded to shoo me away with a rag and wipe down every surface I had touched as if I were carrying the plague. He then loudly began passive aggressively complaining about me to a fellow customer.  I’m one who loves the quirks of bad businesses - the mismanaged greasy spoon, burnt diner coffee, and house painted murals on restaurant walls are endearing, but i draw the line at verbal harassment.  Spend your money at any of the numerous better cafes within a 50 foot radius, and skip this tourist trap."
Cavalli Cafe,Holy cannoli!!!!   Seriously one of the best items we consumed all weekend!  Highly recommended and latte was great as well!  Thank you for the little piece of heaven!
Cavalli Cafe,"It has most fascinating people watching view of street life that I could gaze  forever ;  cafe seems to have  been transplanted here from Casablanca with international soundtrack , along with French pop and rock ; walls are adorned with photos of old San Fran , making it a photo art gallery. I also like the tackiness of how they display photographer Ruth Orkin’s famous photo. Some photos and murals outside cafe on bus stop nearby are great too.  Love their frothy cappuccino and  fashionable cups; their pistachio cannoli is to die for! Also they televise all global soccer matches for free. Only thing missing is a hookah;  Love taking photos of the scenes surrounding this cafe , esp on quite Monday nights"
Cavalli Cafe,"10/10 recommend this place. The atmosphere,the music and the decors are great. As a coffee lover, I can tell you that the coffee is a must try there. The cannoli with the orange vest is so good. If you are in San Francisco you need to come to this italien coffee place."
Cavalli Cafe,"Stopped off to get some dessert in North Beach and boy did we get lucky!  The delicious cannolis were sweet and creamy with a delicate pastry. And, if that wasn't enough, their wedding cookies simply melted in your mouth. Can't wait to go back."
Cavalli Cafe,"The place needs more reviews!!! The espresso, pastries, cannolis everything were outstanding!!"
Cavalli Cafe,Come on i’ve had 2 Italian Restaurants  back in the day but this little pastry/ Cappuccino & beverage shop was THE BEST!!! The cannoli & Cappuccino was THE BEST IVE EVER HAD HONESTLY! The owner was so fun & sweet and totally takes pride in what he does!!! Grazie Mille!!!!
Cavalli Cafe,"My husband picked this place out during his first trip to SF; he's from Napoli. The espresso was nice and creamy, so it met his discerning taste. The cannoli, however, was not authentic. He noted that it was cream, not ricotta, and that the orange tasted like it'd been thawed from frozen."
Cavalli Cafe,"I’m gonna have to reply to this usually we  don’t but your husband is wrong about Ricotta cheese It’s a real Ricotta cheese, and that’s why are Fresh cannolis  made to order and you can bring any  expert to taste it. And by the way, the cannoli was made in front of your eyes how that can be possible to be frozen Thank you."
Cavalli Cafe,"It’s probably the best cannoli the city has to offer, but $9.79 for just one cannoli is kinda outrageous expensive… it used to be ~ half the price before the pandemic."
Cavalli Cafe,"The owner is NOT prejudiced against Asians. I'm Asian and have been coming here for years though not as much as before since they close early now. Perhaps the other person is the issue.  Anyhow, delicious authentic Italian handmade goodies like tiramisu and cannoli. An Italian owned and operated business, that I'm happy to patronize and recommend."
Cavalli Cafe,Excellent service and coffee. I tried the latte and the cappuccino coffee. The coffee flavor is excellent. Tiramisu is one in a kind! Excellent flavor not to sweet and the canoli is also excellent. 100% recommended 👌
Cavalli Cafe,Loved the freshly made “New York style” Cannoli and our Matcha Latte and Chai Tea - just the right amount of flavour! Nice attic seating and friendly service as well (they really check and make sure that everything are what we want)!!
Cavalli Cafe,"This Italian café is a gem in the city. If you are looking for a cappuccino as good as you would get in Italy itself, you must come here. Lovely place to place to spend hours on the weekend 😌"
Cavalli Cafe,"Came here right before they closed and it was pretty empty. Ordered a cannoli and they made it fresh! It was the perfect amount of filling to pastry ratio, and the candied orange peels were a fantastic addition."
Cavalli Cafe,"Awesome authentic Italian cafe, perfect👍"
Cavalli Cafe,Canolli was great! Tiramisu is not bad. Excellent for breakfast with a view.
Cavalli Cafe,Delightful and intimate spot with a very long history of business in San Francisco. The pictures on the wall alone are with the visit! But then... The house made fresh cannoli is an experience into itself. OMG! I found myself saying over and over while I was eating it how incredibly delicious it was. It's a work of art for the eyes as well as the palate! Add a rich hot cappuccino on a rainy morning and you have guaranteed a great day ahead! Don't miss it!
Cavalli Cafe,"Best tiramisu of my life!! Amazing texture + not too sweet! Hand filled cannolis made to order -- so good & beautifully presented. Big portions for the price, too!"
Cavalli Cafe,"Extremely well made cannoli, they do it half chocolate chip and half pistachio. Very enjoyable and the Latte was spot on too."
Cavalli Cafe,Really good tiramisu and cannoli. Pleasantly surprise my the amazing latte and mocha!
Cavalli Cafe,"Nice place, and very good food"
Cavalli Cafe,"Awesome cannoli! Crispy and well seasoned pastry stuffed with a fresh, creamy, sweet ricotta. Espresso was good as well."
Cavalli Cafe,Sweet Italian cafe with the most luxurious double mocha and biscotti. Great atmosphere with a lovely bar seating area in their second story window overlooking Columbus St and Coit Tower. A new favorite!
Cavalli Cafe,I came here as part of a Culinary tour of north beach and little Italy. I had a mango Italian soda and it was a refreshing treat.
Cavalli Cafe,"Beautiful ambience. Have been to so many cafes around Columbus and the Downtown but, missed this gem in between. Quiet and cozy with plenty of seating inside and outside. Wonderful menu and barista really cares in getting it right. The owner is also super friendly and smiling all the time. Would definitely be on the regular visit list from now on."
Cavalli Cafe,"The coffee was good but Cannoli was by far the worst one I ever had. Also I asked for a large coffee, the charged me double the price and I had refill option on my cup coffee!!  Edited after response from owner: I believe the owner mixed up our table with somebody else, but I prefer to explain. coffee was good taste so I gave 3 star first but after rude and unfair comment from owner I changed it to one star. I ordered 3 Canoli for 5 people and after tasting from both side(because of different taste in each side) we didn't touch the rest. I didn't understand the size of coffee is large and if that so why you were so kind to give us one refill!!!! I didn't complaint in the store about the Canoli because there was customer in line in store and it's rude and unfair to tell the store something is that bad in front of customers!!! if you remember us right I thanked you and even mentioned to you the coffee is good."
Cavalli Cafe,"We do not like to reply to stuff like this, but people have to be honest sometime the mistake was made the barista gave you and your friend or colleague ?   2 large Americanos instead of 1 small and  large, so to make you feel better we told you that we’re going to give you a refill on the house  and you were complaining about the price if you don’t like the price, walk away  don’t buy nothing and about the cannoli. What do you know about cannolis but that’s your opinion but we are willing to give you money back  for the cannoli, but the  weird thing  is nothing left on your plates my understood in life  if someone don’t like something doesn’t eat it what  stop you from complaining at the spot? ???? Oh well "
Cavalli Cafe,Amazing cappuccino and cannoli. Great prices for coffee and they’re open late!
Cavalli Cafe,The tiramisu was delectable. The customer service was the best The owner is a very good guy and very funny.
Cavalli Cafe,Amazing Tiramisu and coffee…
Cavalli Cafe,"Food was amazing, service was amazing, we'll definitely come back for more great canolies"
Cavalli Cafe,"Cavalli Cafe is the perfect embodiment of North Beach. Santo, an Amfali Coast native, took over Cavalli and transformed this historic Italian bookstore (and originally the first Italian printing press on the West Coast) into this iconic cafe straddling the border between Chinatown and North Beach.  No latte art here -- folks come for true Italian espresso imported from Rome. And the cannoli. Santo makes the shells in-house and doesn't fill them until someone orders one -- so no soggy shells!  The cherry on top? Well, it's not a cherry -- it's Santo's secret orange topping! Grab a cannoli and a cappuccino and head to the second floor to pull up a chair to the floor to ceiling windows."
Cavalli Cafe,"The canoli was crisp, crunchy and incredibly indulgent! A must try treat!"
Cavalli Cafe,"Great food, kind people. What more do you need?  :) This is the place to have dessert and hang out in peace."
Cavalli Cafe,Everything is delicious! Best cannoli I ever had! Surprised me!
Cavalli Cafe,"Polite staff, delicious food, nice background music and beautiful decor & views. Opening hours are great too. Loved it :)"
Cavalli Cafe,The prices are high but the taste of coffees are amazing
Cavalli Cafe,"Thank you 🙏 believe me it’s not us everything went up it’s crazy now they make us pay delivery fee, and gas fee, plus the coffee went up. It’s crazy it’s not really fair to anyone"
Cavalli Cafe,Very Tasty options and Great location! Thoughtful staff and owners. I live nearby and they have been Sooooo thoughtful in helping me find Tasty food I can eat with my unfortunate allergy to wheat flour. (Happily oatmeal rye brown rice and quinoa are Great 👍 options …
Cavalli Cafe,"Their cannolis are the absolute best! I normally don’t have too much of a sweet tooth, but when I do, best belieeeve I’m craving some of Cavalli’s cannolis! Delicate and crispy, creamy mascarpone filling, each edge dipped separately, one with pistachios, the other with chocolate chips, oh and to top it all off, a candied orange sliver right atop. Just perfection. Highly recommend!"
Cavalli Cafe,"While on a cannoli pilgrimage in San Francisco, we received a tip that Cavalli Cafe would make our cannoli to order... something that sounded intriguing after all the half frozen restaurant cannolis and stale bakery cannolis that sit in cases all day.  Sure enough, when we ordered, they made the Cannolis right in front of us. The fresh filling, crunchy shell, and orange sauce were incredible. This IS the best cannoli in San Francisco, maybe even all of NorCal. We took   an order to go so we could compare the slightly aged version with nearby bakeries that pop on Yelp for best cannoli in the area. No contest, not even close. The search continues, but this might be peak cannoli."
Cavalli Cafe,Best Cannolis in town. They're fresh and made on request. Great service. Really good staff. Very clean and out door seating is available. Great coffee! Good amount of foam in the latte. A hidden gem.
Cavalli Cafe,"Server was nice at this cute little Italian cafe with upstairs, and outdoor seating. Tiramisu was moist, but not drenched in espresso. Cannoli was NOT good, hard pass next time. Mocha was perfect. Music did NOT fit this cafe."
Cavalli Cafe,Best cannoli I’ve ever had. Freshly made. Wow. Also best service ever.
Cavalli Cafe,"Was excited to try the Tiramisu at an original Italian bakery and it was probably the worst Tiramisu I’ve ever had, it was literally frozen in the middle and warm on the outside 🙃. Then the owner claimed they weren’t even open that day to avoid taking responsability....I was was there (today) 😂 What a clown... 🤡 …"
Cavalli Cafe,Wrong address we are close today happy 2022                        Whatever you say Open close who cares  Lol haahahahah  😂 😂 😂    you should reconsider  One star  ⭐️  You  really should put zero star ⭐️  000 stars
Cavalli Cafe,Hands down the best cannoli I have ever had. sooooo good.
Cavalli Cafe,"What a cannoli! They have some delicious pastry options and really good coffee (the double latte is huge!). The lady at the counter was the best, super friendly and accommodating. Go here if you're looking for an actual café and not an Italian restaurant that serves coffee 😉 …"
Cavalli Cafe,"This is the standard to which all cannoli should be held. Seriously. My favorite Italian deli closed in Oakland maybe 5 years ago and I haven't been able to find a decent cannoli since - until earlier this year when I finally decided to try Cavalli Cafe. Literally it is the perfect cannoli. I'm a brat about certain things, including cannoli, so believe me when I say I would not be writing this review if I wasn't  a staunch believer in the quality. Do yourself a favor and order a cannoli here, and be sure to look at the old photographs of San Francisco on the wall while you wait, or check out the upstairs seating area. Great spot."
Cavalli Cafe,"Pastries are not bad. Service is not good. Not busy at all but slow to help and didn’t even knowledge me waiting for help. When I commented that they seem busy (sarcastically) he said not really. No hi, give me a second, nothing. Pastries were provided in a plastic “Thank You, have a nice day” bag with handles. Not in a paper bag.  Not very sanitary…"
Cavalli Cafe,Are you for real we were close and  The only Reason you came to the coffee to pick up good to go app food So get real  And we know our pastries are good so ridiculous Next time when you come in we’re gonna stop everything what we doing we’re gonna come out To greet you and give you a hug and applaud you for coming in get real‘s Closing time everybody’s tire respect that
Cavalli Cafe,We had several different drinks here. Iced chai latte.... excellent Double mocha..... excellent Almond iced latte.....excellent Pear apricot smoothie......wow Our host were very courteous. Must visit
Cavalli Cafe,"From the moment I walked in I knew this place was going to be authentic. This is truly where the locals and true Italians go. The owner is very nice and approachable. We only got a cookie, coffee and cannoli and all were amazing. The cannoli’s were so delicious and they put a orange hint on them that’s so unique and tasty. If you are in North Beach do not miss Cavalli Cafe for a coffee, quick bite or delicious desserts."
Cavalli Cafe,"They have the tastiest smoothies and Italian pastries in town, and the owner was a five-star human to us."
Cavalli Cafe,Great coffee) nice atmosphere)
Cavalli Cafe,Great ambience with good capuccino and cannoli.
Cavalli Cafe,It gave me a sense of home 😍🤩I looooooved the coffee and the dessert 🥧 and the most beautiful thing about it is that it's homemade. And they have fresh mint for the tea and that is something I have been missing here. 🤩😍😋😋
Cavalli Cafe,"WOW!  What a find.  We were looking for a cafe for an espresso while meandering in North Beach and found this delightful, authentic Italian cafe.  Please get a cannoli.  You will not regret it.  They are home made and they are life changing.  An absolute little-italy gem."
Cavalli Cafe,This place is small with big heart. They care a lot about the drinks they create and the pastries that they serve. It feels like you have been transported to Italy when you walk through their door. I highly recommend.
Cavalli Cafe,stopped by to by a few cookies with some friends and had a great time! the cookies were pretty good but the real gem was the upstairs seating with a wonderful view! service was ok
Cavalli Cafe,"Gluten-free desserts. Great view of Coit Tower upstairs. Has a bathroom and next to the major bus stops in North Beach: #8, #30, #45, #39. Friendly service and reasonable prices. Great stop over for tourists or place for regulars.  Since it may be cash only, there are banks nearby: Bank of America, Bank of the West and Wells Fargo.  According to other reviews this may not be the best place for laptop work but rather a place to sit and enjoy with friends. ^_^"
Cavalli Cafe,"I'm an Italian American & I've been going here for 3 years everytime I'm in town.  He has a great variety of imported Italian drinks + homemade bread for his sandwiches & local bakery pasteries. Very clean, friendly & has outside seating.  Highly recommended."
Cavalli Cafe,"I love this place! The family history of this building and the Italian newspaper company that used to be here fascinated me. But the mind blowing tiramisu is what always has me coming back! There is one Italian man that is in here everytime I come. He is welcoming, inviting, social and sweet. If o want a real SF experience, with culture and history, come here!!!"
Cavalli Cafe,"The tiramisu is excellent, home made style, so problably they are not visually fancy, but the flavour is perfect., And the espressos are really good too.  Also, this is a really nice spot while you are waiting for a table on any of the restaurants around."
Cavalli Cafe,"After getting served coffee I had an awkward encounter with the barista. I can't be sure but it certainly looked like he did something a little unsavory and unsanitary to my beverage. Really quite bizarre. I was just visiting the area and so rather than push anything I just left and walked outdoors and poured the coffee on the ground. Never had anything happen like that in my adult life. However, I did enjoy the cookie I ordered... so I guess you could take your chances here or just order coffee across the street?"
Cavalli Cafe,Tiramisu! I love Italian desserts! I read an awesome review that sent me to this place and they weren't wrong! This place has an amazing Tiramisu and the Cannoli was pretty damn tasty too! I also ordered a capuccino and it was yummers! The place is small and I know some people complain about the laptop time restriction but for a place with few seats it is a necessary evil. I will definitely be back!
Cavalli Cafe,Best coffee and awesome hospitality
Cavalli Cafe,"I am a coffee snob... and this is the best espresso in the U.S.  I am in the military and travel all over, and it can be difficult to find a good cup of coffee.  I went into his shop one morning and was blown away by his espresso.  Do not make a mistake in judging the owner's behavior.  He can be rough around the edges, but he is one of the friendliest owners I have ever met.  He deals with rude ignorant tourists much better than I could!  There's even a perfect spot upstairs to people watch!"
Cavalli Cafe,"Cavalli is the best cafe around, they use the most quality ingredients in their foods, and they have Lavazza espresso which is so good!!! They also have a really cool upstairs area to chill at"
Cavalli Cafe,"I have visited and reviewed nearly 80 cafes in San Francisco.  This is the first place where I was made to feel unwelcome.  I was asked by the owner to put away my laptop after one hour, despite being the only person sitting in the entire cafe.  This is the posted policy and apparently is strictly enforced.  In any case, this wouldn't be good place to work from, much less relax, thanks to the near constant stream of buses stopping right out front.  Not sure about wifi, but definitely no outlets upstairs.  Can't speak to the coffee, but the overpriced, powdered hot chocolate wasn't very good."
Cavalli Cafe,"The best tiramisu! Perfect with americanos. We were looking for a coffee shop where accepts apple pay after jogging, and we ended up getting here, and this place is a gem! I’d definitely visit again here."
Cavalli Cafe,Me and Katie we’re taking some of our engagement photos in front of their cafe..  And they brought us 2 cannoli’s on the house!! So nice:)
Cavalli Cafe,Great breakfast café. 😋
Cavalli Cafe,"Great coffee and great atmosphere. As Sydney siders, this was the first coffee we had in San Fran and we loved it! Friendly staff and a nice opportunity to sit outside in the sunshine."
Cavalli Cafe,"I use to come here all the time for a quick coffee to go, but today I had the worst experience ever! So bad in fact, this is the first bad review I've ever written.  Its a small and hot coffee shop! no ventilation but a couple ceiling fans. I went there to do a little work and had a 10 min conference call to take. The owner had the nerve to interrupt me and say I cannot work from his shop (keep in mind I was the only customer there). I proceeded to explain to him that theres no one in the shop and I wasn't speaking loudly.  He tried to convince me that his ""caffe"" was a place to drink with friends not work......... excuse me....its a small coffee shop! I'm an owner of 5 business and would never interrupt someone on a call especially when it wasn't disturbing anyone at all!  This business owner was not professional at all and would highly recommend spending your $$$ elseware."
Cavalli Cafe,"This is one of those places you love and secretly hope no one else finds out about.  Santo and Fabio both make great cappuccino. The pasta is terrific and homemade. The tiramisu, also homemade, I'd describe more as a religious experience than a dessert.  Quiet, relaxed atmosphere great for getting work done with some excellent people watching if you care to glance out the front window."
Cavalli Cafe,"Best cannolli ever!! My favorite place in North beach to have a coffee (great real italian style espresso) and enjoy a cannolli or a tiramisu, traditional recipes always fresh! The perfect place to recover some energy before keep walking around"
Cavalli Cafe,"Hot sandwiches are great. Nice outdoor seating, even though it's kind of a busy street."
Cavalli Cafe,Excellent canolli.  What makes this place super cool is the upstairs area. So nice to look over little Italy. Nice owner too.
Cavalli Cafe,"We go to this place because they have the best Cannoli that we've found in the city.  We don't get to go as much as we'd like as they close before we can make it there after work (I think around 6).  It's a small place, operated by the owner.  Cash only."
Cavalli Cafe,Ordered matcha but didn’t like it. Informed owner but instead of suggesting something else he could make he started asking why I ordered matcha if I don’t like how it tastes and try to convince me that the way I understood the taste was wrong. After I asked him if I could speak he said that he has been listening to me the entire time but he was just talking over me. I just wanted them to make me something else and accept that customers may not like certain things and it is totally ok. I would give their drinks another try but clearly not an option because of their customer service.
Cavalli Cafe,Hi Maya! We're sorry you had a negative experience in the past and wanted to let you know that Cavalli Cafe is under new management now. We hope  you will join us again for a better customer service experience!
Cavalli Cafe,"The barista told me I was ‘just like them’ when I told him to calm down for loosing his mind at an African-American man for changing into his running shoes in the restauraunt. The outburst was really strange, but the racism that followed was deeply disturbing. We asked what he meant by ‘them’, and he said the same thing again, with contempt in his voice. He told the man and his partner to go to Starbucks. Both he and his partner were calm and handled it well. I’m confident that if something as overtly racist as the baristas behavior was caught on camera the cafe would be boycotted."
Cavalli Cafe,Cannoli here are freshly filled so they maintain a nice toothsome texture. Tiramisu is also great with an excellent balance in its boozyness and sweetness.
Cavalli Cafe,Great atmosphere. Owner was very friendly and made the BEST fresh cannoli!!!! Love this place.
Cavalli Cafe,"Cannoli has a citrus flavor, lemon or orange in the filling, didn’t enjoy it"
Cavalli Cafe,Great coffee and tasty cannoli. Friendly atmosphere. The owner is making coffee by himself. I will definitely come back.
Cavalli Cafe,"Good service (but we were the only ones there as it had just opened), well designed cool space with interesting old photos of the 1906 earthquake on the walls, lovely coffee. Worth a visit."
Cavalli Cafe,"Now that i've visited several moretimes, this has definitely earned all five stars. i've never had any disappointing food or coffee yet !! everything is always gracefully done and delicious..."
Cavalli Cafe,The BEST cannoli I’ve ever had! And the sweetest little shop! Will definitely be going back.
Cavalli Cafe,The seats colour and wall desk are wonderful!
Cavalli Cafe,"Barista didn’t know what a cortado was, latte was really mediocre. Coffee here is closer to a Starbucks than anything Italian"
Cavalli Cafe,"This has got to be like mine and my family's favorite place in San Francisco. The drinks and food are great, and the workers are so inviting!"
Cavalli Cafe,"Favorite coffee in North Beach and one of top favorites in SF!  There's no wifi, so it's more of a place to grab coffee and go, or grab some dessert and coffee and stay there for a lil bit."
Cavalli Cafe,Sweet 😃 …
Cavalli Cafe,"Great little cafe, with homemade cakes and funny barista."
Cavalli Cafe,What is better than to have your espresso with delicious homemade biscuits in an authentic Italian café while you sit on a table overlooking little Italy San Francisco

Cavalli Cafe,Made me a Latte that’s so incredibly hot to drink and then wanted to charge $1.50 when I asked for a cup of ice to pour the coffee in in order to drink. What business attitude?
Cavalli Cafe,"Hi LeAnne & Keith, we are so sorry you had such a bad experience. Cavalli Cafe is now under new management and we are dedicated to providing quality drinks and customer service. I hope you will join us again for a latte that won't disappoint!"

Cavalli Cafe,"First time in San Francisco, I came across this place, and the word tiramisu made me enter. I was not wrong. Excellent everything! 10/10"
Cavalli Cafe,"Exquisite coffee! They have treated me very well. If it's busy it's worth the wait. It may look older than other places in the area, but inside it has beautiful memorabilia of the neighborhood. Remember that the final price will include taxes and tips (the latter are always suggested).  You can eat inside or at the tables set up outside.  You can pay in cash or card.  Bathrooms on the second level. Mixed. Very well conditioned and clean."
Cavalli Cafe,The cannoli had a special flavor because of the caramelized orange. There are places to sit inside

Cavalli Cafe,"Hello everyone, for the visit from March 9 to March 24, I always go to the Cavalli cafeteria, which is characterized by its rich breakfast, especially the sweet and fresh natural orange juice with the kindness of the owner."
Cavalli Cafe,"Excellent cannoli and unbeatable tiramisu. Good place to take a rest on the tourist route. Mint water is complimentary, refreshing, thank you. Kind attention."
Cavalli Cafe,"A characteristic place, not so much for the bar itself, which in any case has one of the best ""Italian coffees"" in the United States, but for what the owner can tell you, one of the few true Italians left in the little Italy of Frisco."
Cavalli Cafe,"Bar located in San Francisco's little Italy, I recommend it to all Italians who, being in America, feel the need to drink a good Italian coffee"
