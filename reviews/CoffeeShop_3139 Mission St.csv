CoffeeShop,They are really kind and make the drinks quick!  They have the best iced mochas in San Francisco! It tastes like tiny little specks of the most decadent creamy chocolate bar. 100/10 recommend. The iced vanilla lattes are also good! I’ve yet to try the matcha so that’s next 🍵 (the egg muffin is AMAZING)
CoffeeShop,"I love to start my mornings with a walk to Coffee Shop for a amazing latte.  Mayya is one of the amazing staff and she is a maestra barista! Plus, she is a musician and always has some great music going in the mornings. The coffee is roasted in house and the croissants are Parisian-quality ,made in-house, butter bombs of deliciousness.  The entire staff and owners have created a real community at this little spot on 21st Street."
CoffeeShop,A close friend introduced me to this wonderful hidden gem! Who knew I could find professional-level French pastries and superb variety of coffee drinks in this small coffee shop at the same level of another huge nearby manufactory without the lines and crowds. Right here! 5 small sidewalk tables available and a unisex restroom.
CoffeeShop,"Dreamy little cafe. The focus is kept small but they are doing it well. Staff and owners are super friendly and welcoming and there is a great vibe. Pastries will have to be trial on the return visit but they look fantastic particularly for the size of the space they have. Definitely recommend, hope to return."
CoffeeShop,Delicious. I got an iced oat latte and Devil inside pastry. Plenty of parking around on a Saturday afternoon
CoffeeShop,"Excellent place, excellent coffee, high level of service. Nice to people, animals and the homeless"
CoffeeShop,CoffeeShop is a hidden gem in the Mission district. Their pastries are baked the night before and the coffee beans are freshly roasted - all at the shop! Even if you just want a warm cup of tea - this shop has to offer many varieties to satisfy your cravings. The design is so cozy and elegant. You can tell that Olga poured her whole heart into the shop and bakery. I will be returning many more times. 🥰
CoffeeShop,Another self roast coffee store.  The coffee is good but light for me.
CoffeeShop,"fyi, can only speak to the pastries and they were okay at best. like how they toast them though. will come back to try the coffee though! also, not much seating outside  chocolate croissant: liked the crunchy outside and softer interior but the croissant was too hollow itself  devils within: remake of the classic craftsman and wolves pastry. this was flavorless and the egg was over cooked. would skip this and go to the real deal in the mission."
CoffeeShop,"A quiet, cozy neighborhood coffee shot with an excellent latte and IMO an even better dirty chai. Plenty of seating out front for you and your pup to enjoy the sun."
CoffeeShop,Amazing pastries and delicious coffee! Highly recommend. Whenever I’m in the neighborhood - would always stop by and treat myself with those croissants / muffins / cookies!
CoffeeShop,"Owner was really nice, he and his wife run the place and bake all the pastries in house. Definitely recommend the savory breakfast muffin- has a whole egg inside!"
CoffeeShop,Best coffee shop in the city! The flavor of the coffee is amazing!!! Best late ever! And  the croissants are amazing! Parole is great!
CoffeeShop,"Today was my first time here, even though it’s further from my house than other coffee shops. I wanted to support a smaller business, and I am so glad I did! The coffee was rich and luxurious, and the in house made pastries are incredible. Not to mention I came in the last five minutes and service was still exceptional. Thank you for a delightful experience. I’ll be back!"
CoffeeShop,Owner was fun. The iced coffee was great. The sherpa my wife had was new to us from the east coast and delicious. Chocolate cookie tasted like a brownie. Awesome. Wish this was my local coffee shop.
CoffeeShop,"Smoothest and most delicious coffee we have had so far. We purchased the Papua New Guinea roast, and I had a matcha to go. Delicious. And we were greeted so kindly, even towards the end of the day on Xmas Eve. Thank you for the great experience."
CoffeeShop,Great coffee and macha. Lovely pastries and they have a few seats outside.
CoffeeShop,"What an amazing spot! Super cute little tucked away café with not only delicious coffee, but such a nice owner! Super craft coffee he and his wife do from green beans. Awesome new tech using an Green tech coffee roaster.  The coffee has lovely flavor and he has a super creative way of making his awesome aged cold brew. I HIGHLY recommend the vanilla simple he makes if you like sweet and flavor!  The Thai breakfast coffee he makes is breakfast heaven. Filling, thick and delicious!  I recommend the croissant, as his wife makes them from scratch! Flakie and buttery. Good with any of the drink he makes! Will be back and im excited to scope out their other location."
CoffeeShop,Really nice place tucked away in a beautiful little neighborhood.  The ham and cheese crossiant really surprised me!great spot to waste a lil bit of time!
CoffeeShop,Coffee is so good! I tried both hot mocha and iced mocha and never was disappointed! Croissant and savory scones are also delicious 🤤 …
CoffeeShop,I love Wilson and Olga and all the people they’ve hired. They are great citizens of the neighborhood. Before they even opened they brought refreshments to us who were working in the community garden. They work hard to get my admittedly complicated latte order just right! I can’t say enough about their positive energy. This neighborhood is very diverse and they treat everyone with great kindness. When you sit at any coffee shop long enough (i’ve written a whole book on the sidewalk outside the shop) you get a sense of the people who run a place. Wilson and Olga are stellar humans.
CoffeeShop,"Husband and wife run coffee shop with shockingly good coffee. They do a lot of their own roasting. There are a lot of places around that do a good espresso, and this place can hold its own, but it’s brewed coffee is more of the highlight for me. The cold brew here with the coffee ice cubes though is one of my favorites, where they really stand out.  They make their own pastries for sale here too, replicating some of the more unique items that are popular from local bakeries (e.g. rebel within). They are surprising good!  Unfortunately not much seating inside or out,  and what seating does exist outside is not particularly nice, so hard to make this a destination or a place to meet someone."
CoffeeShop,"The drip coffee was excellently brewed, and paired perfectly with a chocolate chip hazelnut cookie. There’s no real indoor seating, but the weather made it a joy to sit outside on a quiet Saturday morning. I’ll definitely be back."
CoffeeShop,"This is our go-to coffee shop on this side of the mission district. Really well made espresso drinks and pastries. We’ve tried a cold brew, chai latte, and cappuccino here and they were all good. Pretty consistent across days. Closes earlier than other cafes but that’s a good way to make sure your last coffee isn’t too late in the day. The everything croissant is indulgent but great to share. 8 oz cappuccino is only $4 so comparable to nearby cafes."
CoffeeShop,Perfect oat cappuccino and delicious pastries made in house! Highly recommend
CoffeeShop,"Good pastries, good coffee and nice space. They have wifi."
CoffeeShop,My favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood! The owner is nice and the coffee is delicious
CoffeeShop,"This a really great place to get some good coffee and amazing croissants. Above all, their staff is very friendly! There's a small waiting area inside, they have a few tables outside."
CoffeeShop,There is a “higher” taste happening at coffee shop. Everything’s right! From the coffe to their pastries down to the cup and so on. There is a sense of purity in their oat milk latte that is so wonderful that I find it difficult to describe. Also a good place to basque in the mid morning sunlight.
CoffeeShop,Great cappuccino & perfect croissant. I sat at an outside table (no indoor dining) after being served by a sweet barista. Quiet neighborhood spot and only one low key tech conversation in earshot.
CoffeeShop,"Delicious cookies and pastries, and espresso drinks.  Found myself wishing that my mocha had had the delicious Belgian chocolate at the bottom better incorporated, but talked to the owner and he says this is just his style and to get my finger in at the end, there! A different style, and I have to say that the coffee-infused creamy chocolate pudding at the end is really tasty. You just have to give up on the instant gratification."
CoffeeShop,"Love this place! Staff is awesome and the freshly baked goods and beverages— high quality and so tasty. The Devil Inside and Hazelnut Chocolate Chip Cookie are my favorites but literally everything is worth trying. And I love getting the matcha 😋 So happy to have found a coffee shop that cultivates community. Thank you, Wilson & Olga! Oh and they’re open 7 days a week, follow them on insta to see the goodness: @sfcoffeeshop ✌🏼"
CoffeeShop,Incredible neighborhood coffee shop with in-house roasting by dynamic husband and wife team. Some of the best croissants around  Update: vegan berry muffins are just outrageously good
CoffeeShop,"I love it here. Staff is wonderful, everything is quality. Highly recommend :)"
CoffeeShop,"If you love quality coffee/beans this place is top notch. Not only is the coffee superior, Wilson is warm & welcoming! He will have a conversation with every customer as they come in and he’s a local neighborhood shop owner. I love stopping in to support him!  Plus he’ll brew you a coffee of any of his beans so you can choose ☕️  Coffee 💯 Customer service 💯 Ambience 💯 Local 💯"
CoffeeShop,"This place has great energy and such quality coffee and baked goods. “The Devil Inside” is a scrumptious, savory treat and the house-made vanilla syrup for lattes is superb. Grateful to have this spot in the neighborhood!"
CoffeeShop,"Great addition to the hood. Feels like a taste of France. Lovely cappuccinos and absolutely the best almond croissant ever to pass my lips. Great to support small family biz. They make everything. Go for the coffee, stay for the connection."
CoffeeShop,"I used to frequent CoffeeShop on Mission for years until my office moved.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the new location in my hood.  Love the drinks and snacks and owners.  The cold brew is no joke, very strong and made with coffee iced cubes.  I've become a huge fan of their Thai Breakfast coffee, check it out."
CoffeeShop,This is my favorite cafe in SF.  Their iced coffee (with coffee ice cubes!) is soooooooooo good.  And the lattes.  And the pastries.  All the staff are very nice as well.
CoffeeShop,Excellent matcha ! Good pain au chocolat Great address
CoffeeShop,This spot kind of reminds me of some of the original Blue Bottle retailers who would pop up in the smallest spaces and make some of the best coffee in the city a few years back. The really good old days of coffee in San Francisco. 10/10 would recommend stopping in for a cup if in the neighborhood.
CoffeeShop,"Owner Wilson is super friendly and makes a really delicious latte, with his wife baking all the delicious goodies! It's easy to miss this spot when you're walking in the neighborhood, but check them out, you will be hooked for more."
CoffeeShop,Best coffee in the entire bay area. Super friendly staff. Amazing pastries.
CoffeeShop,"People won’t remember what you said to them, but they’ll remember how you made them feel. I visited CoffeeShop for the first time today while walking through my neighborhood, and I’m so glad I did because now I know never to go again. I was greeted by the owner, who talked a long time about his experience in the industry (who cares) and then when I tried to order an iced americano, he told me I was “cute” for trying to order something that wasn’t on the menu. He offered me an iced coffee (I didn’t ask for that) and when I tried it the flavor just wasn’t for me. The owner seemed to take great offense to this and told me that I probably shouldn’t order anything there, reminded me again that I’m “cute” and dismissed me. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! I have never been so patronized by a proprietor before — I’ll surely not forget it! As a customer, to be made to feel as though you don’t know anything is a terrible feeling. I definitely won’t be returning and I hope no one who frequents this business will ever be treated as poorly as I was. Bad taste in my mouth, literally."
CoffeeShop,"The iced matcha latte here is INSANE! So good, highly recommend!"
CoffeeShop,"Friendly service, great coffee, excellent pastries. Everything tastes fresh, and the person behind the counter clearly knows what he's doing. Can't recommend enough."
CoffeeShop,"Such great ambiance. Coffee & pastries are amazing, especially their everything croissant!"
CoffeeShop,"Cute shop, awesome owner, super nice vibe, and self made pastries. What's not to love"
CoffeeShop,Owner is a cool dude and his Ukrainian wife is a ultra talented baker. Go just to check out the futuristic zero emission roasting thing. Support local business.
CoffeeShop,"My roommate went here & told me about her patronizing experience. Was stoked to try the cafe that’s just around the corner from my house - but hearing what happened to her, they are sure not to get my business.  Bummed about it! I’m a barista and love to support other local businesses so this was definitely sad to hear."
CoffeeShop,The staff is extremely friendly. I had their Thai Breakfast drink and it was SOOO good! 10/10
CoffeeShop,"Best chai in this neighborhood, cute vibes with friendly staff"
CoffeeShop,Best matcha latte I’ve ever had
CoffeeShop,"My go-to coffee shop in the area. I love their coffee, lattes, matcha. They have really good French style croissant and pain-au-chocolat too."
CoffeeShop,Great coffee and homemade fresh pastries
CoffeeShop,Adorable neighborhood coffee shop that uses all sustainably sourced coffees! They had free samples of their bread and it was also delicious
CoffeeShop,This place is amazing and the staff is super down to earth. Might be the best chai latte I've had in the Bay Area.
CoffeeShop,Sublime croissant and perfect cortado. Great service. I love this place!  Also a little free lending library just inside!
CoffeeShop,Cute spot! Had a slice of their pumpkin bread still hot from the oven this morning - perfectly captured the taste of fall.
CoffeeShop,"Excellent lattes, love the oat milk latte with a snack (fika, anyone?). Am also a fan of their Mission/Bernal location. Solid addition to the neighborhood!"
CoffeeShop,The croissant is a layered construction of buttery perfection.  And the coffee is just as good.
CoffeeShop,This coffee shop is my favorite in the neighborhood. I was having so much trouble with my exam last week that I decided to come to your shop and study while sipping a cup of coffee.
CoffeeShop,Barista had mask around their chin. What’s the point? Both times we’ve come here there was no mask being worn. Not worth it.
CoffeeShop,"I ordered ""just coffee""  it was just ok...."
CoffeeShop,"The owner Wilson is a great dude and makes great coffee, so go here! Let’s pump life back into San Francisco’s small businesses!"
CoffeeShop,Drip coffee was about the quality I expect from an airplane- passable but for $3.50 in town I'd hope for better
CoffeeShop,Fav local family-owned coffee place. One of the best matcha lattes in the city 👌🏻 …
