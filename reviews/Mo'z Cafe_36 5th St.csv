Morning Brew Coffee & Tea,"Googled ‘Vietnamese coffee’ nearby and walked to Hong Kee & Kim, only to find out they’re permanently closed. Thankfully so, otherwise I wouldn’t have found this gem! The coffee is powerful and rich in flavor. I can’t stand black coffee and this mix added the perfect amount of sweetness— not overbearing or too watered down. I’ll be ending my Starbucks trips for iced blonde lattes because this is tastier and actually wakes me up. The best part of the experience was meeting Chai! Easily one of the best first impressions ever. Chai is very bubbly and charming! His infectious energy brightened my day, even my coworkers noticed the energy shift. All smiles and laughs! Thank you!"

Morning Brew Coffee & Tea,"Not recommended. They up charge for everything and very rarely does the price on the board equal what you pay.  It would be fine if they overcharged for good food, but, quality is generally lacking and the flavor is bland."
