El Cafetazo,"I want to try some coffee with cake but I wait 10 minutes for somebody to turn their back and see that we are 2 costumers waiting for… before me just 1 costumer and they work so slow with her order… I just leave the place, they need a cashier that stay there just for the costumer and the other can work in orders but 2 people making food and no one taking orders…. also need more cleaning. So if you have plenty of time give them a chance. I was rushing so I didn’t try their food."
El Cafetazo,"Old lady was extremely rude . Took a good 15 minutes to do my order , I asked if I can pay electronically she said no. I then was like okay i don’t have my wallet or any cash so I won’t be buying. Started to complain and giving me an attitude telling me to bring my wallet next time  because she wasted her time making my order . I left my wallet  it in my car which I didn’t have at the moment . First of all won’t they have a sign that the tap didn’t work? I worked retail myself and the machine lights are off until someone taps it with its cell. So I assumed it work. Really rude I now remember why I didn’t come back since it’s been years I haven’t gone."
El Cafetazo,"I was looking for a cafe with wifi in Mission and ended up trying El Cafetazo for a drink and small bite. I was amazed by the coffee and bagel. The cafe is not posh but has an adequate menu, wifi and good people. I ordered a mocha and jalapeno bagel. I was happy with both. Mocha was nicely made and ordered the same one to go after spending 2 hrs there. Worth exploring and trying."
El Cafetazo,"One poor guy working the counter at lunchtime. We had to walk out without ordering. Looks good, but didn't get to try anything."
El Cafetazo,"Hello Mike! We are so sad that you couldn’t wait to be served. We really hope you’ll give it another try! 😔 Our staff members do their best to get everyone the attention and service they need. Thank you for your feedback, we’ll be able to take care of the situation."
El Cafetazo,Cavernous space; bathroom door needs to be buzzed by the cashier; not very hot tea; friendly staff; reasonable drink prices; wall outlets; wifi needs password I guess; big menue; will go there again.
El Cafetazo,Great service and amazing pastries and drink selection.
El Cafetazo,Very friendly and fast service. There was just one person on duty but they did a great job attending to everyone on this Friday afternoon. Delicious Blueberry smoothie was a hit! I enjoyed my fresh carrot juice. Very reasonable prices. I would come back :)
El Cafetazo,"The guy who works the mornings is so rude,  one of the times Ive asked him if he could substitute one of the fruits in the smoothie because I'm allergic,  he flat out told me ""NO"". I've never been disrespectful, even when he's been rude. He's got a bad attitude and after reading other people's reviews on there bad experience there, its done by the same employees and nothing has changed. They really need to teach the employees customer service, but I have a feeling its the owners. Sad"
El Cafetazo,I ask for cream cheese beagle with ham. This is what I got. And they take forever.
El Cafetazo,"The older woman and older man behind the register treated me like trash! I came in and was very excited to try a new smoothie place. However it was a HORRIBLE experience. I was polite but from the minute they saw me, they were rude and condescending! I had never met these people in my life and they glared at me and treated me with no respect. At one point, I asked the older man a question about adding pineapple to a smoothie and he shook his head and told me he wasn't going to help me. Seriously??? The lady also was rude and negative the whole time. I will never be coming back and also be telling all my friends to steer clear of this place bc they don't deserve to be treated like I was."
El Cafetazo,"Dear Lizzy, we'll definitely talk to our staff about your experience, but we are surprised by your description, and especially by the tone of your message. We hope that you'll find a place that would finally make you happy."
El Cafetazo,"They have a very complex menu as a lot of what they offer is either on laminated papers in random places or on a sandwich board outside. The super massive (& faded) chalk board menus above the counter could easily accommodate everything. The employees behind the counter are good people and everything they make is great! Im always happy to support small businesses such as this one. If you can look past the decor, they are a 5 🌟 on all the essentials 🙂"
El Cafetazo,Looks like I'm not the only one to complain about rude customer service! The older woman and older man at the register are very unpleasant and treat customers terribly. They both act like they don't want to be there and treat black people very bad. Food is also only average. Fair warning to stay away!!!
El Cafetazo,The food is not fresh. I order a breakfast burrito and they already have it premade just to heated in the microwave. When i taste for sure a taco bell is more fresh and soft that the food. Also the lady in the cashiers is not helping with her attitude. They also have problem with electrical panel. Because one section of the restaurant was dark when they use one of the coffee machine. I dont recommend them
El Cafetazo,"I came wanting to buy something, but first I needed to change my baby's diaper. I had asked the lady if I could use the restroom &she said that it was for customers only and walked off. So I went to the cashier&asked him, he buzzed the door for me, but the lady came out&put herself in front of the door &began to say that people like us just want to buy things from other stores&go in there just to use their bathroom. And I asked her how did she know I wasn't going to buy something. She kept ranting& walked away. So I changed my baby's diaper right there in the stroller in the middle of the store, because he NEEDED his diaper changed. And decided not to buy anything for her rude attitude & comments"
El Cafetazo,"Dear Daniela, it is hard to answer to you with your horrible experience! I'm very sorry you went through this... sometime it is very difficult for our managing team to identify the real customers with those that they are not in such a big city like San Francisco, and we try to keep out facilities at best for our customers. Thank you!"
El Cafetazo,"Ordered a mocha and two tamales. The mocha was great and the tamales were quite big; stuffed with cheese, bell pepper, and small pieces of shrimp. Very good taste but were a bit greasy and not soft enough."
El Cafetazo,"Good place to grab a bite. But employees drag to make your order. The tv they watch while preparing your food. So make sure your order is right. Got the begal with cream cheese, onion and tomato. The employee added to much and was falling all over the place 😖 …"
El Cafetazo,"Hi Marina! We are sorry to hear that your order was not correct, please give us another visit to make it up to you! It may be the Soccer World Cup that had all Mexico a little on the distraction side.  We care about your comments! Thank you for your feedback."
El Cafetazo,"Well the people that work here are very nice and courtesy also a number of nice foods like tamales, sandwiches and coffee or smoothies and ice cream as a variety of different sodas water and health drinks but sometimes only one person doing a lot but a nice place one of my favorite places to go."
El Cafetazo,The coffee is still coffee at this establishment gave me the go I needed at 7am to get my day started. Great taste good buzz and good employees that respect all the different kinds of people who might walk in kick Starbucks go here for sure 👍 …
El Cafetazo,"The staff is indifferent, pastry is stale & a long waiting time just to place an order.  I paid for a ham & cheese sandwich for lunch.  What I ended up with is a cold bun with a mayo saturated mess (minus the ham & cheese).  Do not waste your time or money at this place."
El Cafetazo,"Hi Robert! So sorry about your sandwich! We would have loved to be able to change when you got it. We'll work on our staff to make sure they make our place a happy one and welcome one! If you would like to give it another try, we will make it up to you! Thank you for your feedback, it is very important to us!"
El Cafetazo,They have some of the most flavorful cofcee I've tasted. I also like the staff who work tirelessly to make sure the whole experience is good. I like the overall cleanliness too
El Cafetazo,The customer service sucks majorly took them 30 minutes just buzz me in to allow my son to use the restroom...... However when the Latino guy works he always opens it immediately
El Cafetazo,"Great place for coffees, breakfast, lunching, etc... cheap prices (as compared to other similar  places in SF), kids friendly, nice people , relaxed. Recommended for tourists searching for authentic local."
El Cafetazo,"Ok place. Owner always seems upset having to serve you.  Maybe it has to do with how bad that area of the mission is, nothing but homeless and drug addicts."
El Cafetazo,"Hello David, I'm very sorry to hear that we looked upset to you... not sure if it was me that you encountered, but I would like to apologies for it anyway. It is true that San Francisco has homeless and it is not a secret to anyone, but we try our best to have a good coffee and a pleasant place for our customers to enjoy. Thank you for your review, we appreciate the feedback!"
El Cafetazo,"Good custumer service.  is a clean place with alot of varieties of coffee,hot chocolate, natural juices, ice-cream pastry sandwiches and miscellaneous. and free Wi-FI."

El Cafetazo,Ordered some chicken/beef tamales from there yesterday and I had more Masa than filling which wasn't flavorful at all—more spicy instead.
El Cafetazo,Carolyn! so sorry about the Tamales. There are many ways to make tamales... you may want to try something else... your feedback is important! We want to sale things that people enjoy!!! Thank you for your feedback!!

El Cafetazo,It was the first time I ate in that place but you have to wait to be served and then I got the surprise of my bagel that bad I think that if they can realize that it was burned because they wrapped it for me that does not allow someone to return like this another you see.
