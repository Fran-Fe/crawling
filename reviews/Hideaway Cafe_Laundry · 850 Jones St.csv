Hideaway Cafe,"Person working the store was really friendly and accommodating. The machine worked well and the coffee wasn't too bad either. Funny to say, I liked the atmosphere too!  I recommend coming here to get your laundry done or to just grab a quick bite and some coffee!"
Hideaway Cafe,Been a repeat customer for years and this place has best coffee and breakfast sandwiches in this part of Nob hill. Friendly staff and very reasonably priced. Also a great place to hang out while doing a load of laundry.
Hideaway Cafe,"You'll be pleasantly surprised to find one of the best coffees in such a hidden spot. I do my laundry here and always get a drink. It's strong enough where you don't need to ask for a second shot of espresso. And the stuff is so friendly and nice at all times! Great quality, taste and price! Love it!"
Hideaway Cafe,"The little hidden gem. Cozy space, best coffee, music and bites in the Lower Nob Hill neighborhood ❤️☕️🥯🎶✅ Hey, and it has new washing equipment 💦 …"
Hideaway Cafe,"This place is such a hidden gem. The barista was super nice and funny, and coffee and pastries were perfect. I got an iced salted caramel and matcha latte, and almond croissant. I might ask to decrease the sweetness next time, but thats on me. Can’t wait to try more things on their menu!"
Hideaway Cafe,"Awesome coffee ! I’m from Melbourne, Australia so used to good coffee and this coffee is good. Great service too."
Hideaway Cafe,"This place has a really nice cafe, cozy. Great place to meet up, it's called the Hide Away Cafe. The barista (Gigi) is gorgeous and friendly. The coffee is great, as well as the food. Reasonably priced."
Hideaway Cafe,"So dysfunctional, seems like nobody actually works here since no one's at the counter half the time I come here and the other half of the time they're messing up my order or the checkout system doesn't work lmao. & the bagels r stale and not good"
Hideaway Cafe,"Hi Sara, our baristas responsibilities also include assisting customers in the laundromat section, and socializing with the many tourists San Francisco receives, so it is by intention that they are not sitting idly at the cafe counter waiting for the next customer. I apologize for any order mishap, we keep a tight minimal menu to eliminate that possibility, and am surprised at the comment of the checkout system being down as it is a newer system that has a back up....so it should never not work. That being said if the neighborhood is having an internet issue, certain features like Apple pay may not be available at that time. And I apologize if our staff did not inform you that our bagels are not the hard, crispy New York style bagels you may have been expecting, as we use the softer sandwich style for flavor and sandwich integrity. Typically customers request extra toasted for that hard New York bagel experience."
Hideaway Cafe,"I had to do laundry tonight, desperately. This place was great really. Granted I was the only person there..but still. They have nice chairs and games and wifi and a change machine. Also a cafe next door and some corner stores nearby. More perks than I'm used to for sure, although you do pay for these conveniences. It's 3.75 per load and 0.25 for 6 minutes drying time. In the end I was totally fine with the additional cost (largely because of their generous hours). I left at 10:55pm with no hassle from anyone. Here's my view, exquisite."
Hideaway Cafe,"Traveling with family and I always wash mid trip, and before returning home. I used to wash up the road but decided to give this a try based on reviews. A much better experience here! The place is bright and the machines are clean. Even at 9 pm I felt safe. There were 3 other people also doing their wash at this time."
Hideaway Cafe,What an absolute gem. This is what makes SF special
Hideaway Cafe,"It was two blocks away from the hotel however my measurements were “two hills” and thicker calves! My go to laundromat and a part of the reason we had to move 🤦🏾 I didn’t have a problem with the walk it was worth it. I usually went on Monday’s my day off and one night my clothes got stuck in the washer we later learned a sensor died.  Called the emergency number listed and nice guy named Ken told me to go to the market around the corner and they give me a bag; my laundry bag stuck in the washer so I didn’t have to carry my other load in my arms and they guy gave me a bag!  He also said he’d re-wash, dry and fold my items and have them ready for me when I got off! They closed at 2:00 I got off at 4:00 and yes he and his crew were waiting for me when I arrived at 4:40 they were total Godsends and I am so glad they were there because the hotel had no laundry! Was there yesterday and needed a sharpie to mark my bags for the move and got to thank him in person “great guy” and a great service!"
Hideaway Cafe,"Having been in SF for 9 days,  need a laundry service on Sunday.  This place is a hidden gem. Quiet, safe and folks are friendly.  They have free WiFi as well. Haven’t seen much of this sort of place near where I stay. Definitely recommend !"
Hideaway Cafe,Rude and condescending attitude from barista. Clearly a disparity between how I was treated and other patrons who entered the store.
Hideaway Cafe,"The machines are nothing special, a basic wash & dry is at least $5 and the place itself is pretty small (not too many machines & even fewer going areas). But what it lacks in size and volume, it makes up for with cleanliness and serenity.  When you add in the attached café/bakery and the centralized location for pac heights & nob hill residents, you can't ask for much more at this price."
Hideaway Cafe,"Out of all the cafes I have tried in SF, Hideaway Cafe makes the best coffee so far. If you like cream and sugar, ask for Ken's coffee ( you'll thank me after! ;)). Their mochas and lattes are amazing too.  It doesn't end here, I particularly like to eat the SF bagel sandwich (comes with salmon, ham, avocado, cream cheese etc...and happiness) toasted at a very reasonable price. I'm not a fan of bagel in general but this sandwich is an exception for me. Its filling, healthy and super delicious! If you see Ken (owner), say hi! I promise you he will make your day with his witty friendly banter! :)"
Hideaway Cafe,"Such a lovely place!!! Comfortable Laundromat, with a nice cafe to hide in while waiting for the laundry to be done. The owner was super nice and helpful, and the coffee was ths best I had in the USA so far"
Hideaway Cafe,"So unique, go check it out. Great coffee, super cozy vibe. Why doesn’t my laundry place do this?! 😆 Had a yummy Americano and bought hubby a Mocha. Heading back today. …"
Hideaway Cafe,She warmed up my croissant just slightly so it was delicious! Great selection of baked goods and coffee. I had the Irish cream latte.
Hideaway Cafe,This place just saved me from a laundry disaster when my apt.'s change machine ran out of quarters! Got my bill changed to quarters and grabbed a good latte from the super nice gal working the cafe. The place was super clean too.
Hideaway Cafe,"Safe location, free wifi, opens early and closes late. Coin exchange and detergent/softener dispenser available."
Hideaway Cafe,The washing machines and dryers work well. The place is decent and clean. Highly recommended.
Hideaway Cafe,Place was clean and comfortable.. Was a very helpful guy around (owner or staff?) Change machine.. Nice atmosphere.. No washroom so go before.. 👌
Hideaway Cafe,"Clean, friendly, great machines, and I get to have breakfast or lunch and great conversation.  Great place to do your laundry"
Hideaway Cafe,"Staff is very nice and helpful. Place is always clean. Some machines don't work but they are marked, and they have tons."
Hideaway Cafe,"Excellent experience and highly recommend! As a traveler in need of laundry and coffee, this cafe delivered & the service was exceptional."
Hideaway Cafe,"Needed a laundromat on a recent San Francisco trip. Very clean, friendly place. Cafe attached was perfect."
Hideaway Cafe,A great little cafe with scrumptious food and creative yummy lattes.  Right next door is a laundry mat!!!! SCORE
Hideaway Cafe,"Used to be my go to place but I realized after a few visits that they have no hot water. Tested it a few times and just stopped paying extra for hot water, then found a new place with hot water. Disappointing because the owner seemed cool."
Hideaway Cafe,Good service The worker gave us a lot of recommendations of what to do around San Francisco however the coffee was just average
Hideaway Cafe,Great laundromat with a nice little cafe to get coffee and hang out at while getting laundry done.
Hideaway Cafe,The coffee is awesome and the use Bicycle Coffee.  The staff is very friendly.  I come here often to relax.  The pizza is great too.
Hideaway Cafe,"Went here due to the high reviews, was not disappointed at all. $3.25 for a load at 25 minutes, another $1.25 for 30 minutes tumble dry, $3 for a small bottle of detergent. The owner walked me through all the steps. Want your clothes fresh and dry? Look no further."
Hideaway Cafe,"Great food, helpful and friendly staff and lots to keep you preoccupied whilst your wait for your laundry. Ideal for tourists"
Hideaway Cafe,"Fantastic!  Hughly recommended.  The owner kept a very close eye on everything and was constantly walking around ensuring all was ok.  Not being someone that has used a laundromat before and seeing some of the 'locals,' I was expecting a dirty, grimy venue. However it was the opposite.  Great place!"
Hideaway Cafe,Went here upon reviews. Clean and easy to use. There is a cafe so had a tea and bagel while waiting. There is free WiFi as well. Staff very friendly and helpful :)
Hideaway Cafe,"This laundromat has paired a cafe in the back, a perfect place to wait for my own laundry to finish. I had the breakfast salmon bagel with hot chocolate there and the food is delicious. The place is clean, quiet and brightly lit with super nice and friendly people.  I highly recommend this place to anyone."
Hideaway Cafe,This place totally rocks. While doing yr laundry...take a load off and chill in the cafe. Totally recommend the iced caramel macchiato latte. The owner is a top bloke!
Hideaway Cafe,Awesome place very customer service experienced a place to have a snack and do homework or have breakfast or lunch while doing laundry.
Hideaway Cafe,"Staff are so friendly , laundromat is clean and very reasonably priced . Cafe is awesome too"
Hideaway Cafe,Love it! It's open late and never crowded. The laundromat attached to it I mean..
Hideaway Cafe,I had to downgrade my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. This is due to the people that work there. The place is nice and kept it pretty clean in the machines are in good working order. The prices are competitive and then location is good.
Hideaway Cafe,Owner is very friendly and approachable. I’m a visitor and was amazed by the affordable prices and friendly and cozy atmosphere. Would highly recommend!
Hideaway Cafe,Clean machines and safe space. The owner and staff are really friendly and helpful to newcomers and guided us through the whole process. No need for travellers to bring your own detergent. Everything you need is available in the vending machine. There’s also a cozy cafe to have pizza or bagels while you wait for your machines to finish.
Hideaway Cafe,Nice cafe environment while you wait for your laundry to finish
Hideaway Cafe,Makes laundry pleasant. Owner and staff are friendly and I can have a coffee and enjoy wifi while I wait. You can get cash if the cafe is open. There is a quarter machine on the premises. I walk an extra five blocks to do laundry here instead of someplace closer.
Hideaway Cafe,Wonderful service and coffee! The owner is pleasant and helpful. The place is clean- definitely the best in the area.
Hideaway Cafe,"Fantastic service from owner Ken. Stayed around for a couple hours enjoying great coffee, pizzas and excellent hospitality. Who would have thought doing your laundry in San Francisco would turn out to be so memorable... from a couple of Aussies David & Kathy"
Hideaway Cafe,"New and quick machines, change and soap dispensers available, felt safe, and no problem getting machines. There's a little cafe inside and the owner is super friendly and accommodating."
Hideaway Cafe,"The new owner takes care of problems on the spot, helps customers and keeps problem people out. There is also a cafe with tv and wifi to enjoy while you are doing all those loads of laundry. They have great oversized washers for comforters, blankets etc."
Hideaway Cafe,Very clean and quiet. Nice neighborhood. Decent prices for anywhere I would say. $2.75 for 22 lb washer and $.25 per 6 minutes of dry time. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone needing laundromat while in San Francisco.
Hideaway Cafe,Nice laundromat and a cafe with excellent coffee and the salmon bagel really hit the spot.
Hideaway Cafe,"Clean place, well maintained, everything available, just bring your laundry"
Hideaway Cafe,"Wow! We had a nice and tasty breakfast while waiting for your laundry. Good, new and fast machines. Warm and friendly welcome. Greetings from Luxembourg 😄 …"
Hideaway Cafe,"Travelling with 3 kids means dirty laundry. This place was a godsend. Is clean, well set out, and easy to use. Machine size options meant we washed 4 normal loads in the one machine and dried in the one dryer. All up cost $10 - bargain compared to standard hotel options - and all done in 1 hour."
Hideaway Cafe,Still good price for verticle wash and dry. Changer and vending machine for extra washing essentials and extra bags. Good location for security. Open late evening.
Hideaway Cafe,Nice staff man Bryant..clean.. Quiet.affordable and places to plug in a phone thankGod some buisness owners still consider this is San Francisco and know how to run a buisness...
Hideaway Cafe,"In a chaotic city of madness and human waste, this is a haven of peace and civility. Change machines work, and you don't feel like a dive into alcohol afterwards."
Hideaway Cafe,Absolutely brilliant service. Ken is so friendly and approachable. Secure location and well maintained machines.
Hideaway Cafe,"It's a bit more expensive than other laundry places in the area, but free wifi and a clean place make worth it."
Hideaway Cafe,Great place to wash or sit and enjoy a cup of coffee
Hideaway Cafe,Like this laundromat. It's in a safe location. It also has newer machines. I've checked out a couple in the area. I'm told the ones on eddy street are dangerous at night. The other ones I've been to also charge more for small loads.
Hideaway Cafe,"Not all laundry.mats created equal. They have good machines, wifi and the area is free of people loitering. Open till 11 which is real nicee"
Hideaway Cafe,"Lots of machines and lots of dryers. The detergent dispensing machine wasn't working, or I had no idea how to buy detergent. So ended up having to buy my separate detergent from the convenience store. It was an ok experience."
Hideaway Cafe,"This place is amazing. Great coffee, great atmosphere and the SF Bagel is killer!"
Hideaway Cafe,Cool new cafe is open at this spot. Good food and coffee while you wash clothes.
Hideaway Cafe,Ken the owner is fantastic - super friendly Clean facilities Good pricing In a good area Recommend
Hideaway Cafe,"This place is a treasure. Half the cost of other SF laundro-cafes, twice as classy, top notch coffee and pastries, impressive range of menu items (I haven't tried em yet) that can get you lunch under $10! And open late! And the owner is great. He is resisting the local trend to gouge customers for his premium service (my words, not his--he just sats he doesn't want to feel like he's ripping anyone off). I hope this place thrives. Its got an authentic tenderness to its vibe (1/2 artsy cafe, 1/2 utilitarian laundromat, 0% trashy OR pretentious) that deserves to be rewarded. I only wish I lived closer. BUT with it open so late, its great for my procrastination-centric custom of doing laundry, so ill be back often."
Hideaway Cafe,Opens early and stays open late. Close by to cafes. Clean and plenty of machines to get laundry done. A bit pricey but it's San Francisco what else you expect!
Hideaway Cafe,"The staff are amazingly friendly they have a washer that holds 65 pounds of clothes and only costs $7. Use, however if the machine us using all services it will take 48 minutes to wash. They have a cafe with ez Ellen selection of custom beverages."
Hideaway Cafe,Great in city/downtown laundry wash and fold.
Hideaway Cafe,"I have been coming here for a few years, and I have seen the laundromat change management and improve dramatically. The new owner put in a killer café attached to the laundromat, with all kinds of hot food and drinks. The laundry room itself could still use a little TLC-- lots of machines broken at any given time, and still a bit dingy inside. With that said, the place is much improved, and definitely the best laundromat in the neighborhood."
Hideaway Cafe,Great cafe and laundry.  Clean.
Hideaway Cafe,I would never come here again.
Hideaway Cafe,"Dryers are in bad shape. Laundry attendant was constantly changing the temps on my closes while drying. Very weird, made me feel uncomfortable.  I will find elsewhere to do laundry next time."
Hideaway Cafe,Lovely little place to get the laundry done. The Aussie says thanks!
Hideaway Cafe,Great coffee
Hideaway Cafe,"I thought it was good. We're not talking ""lah-ti-dah"" but it's clean, safe and usually someone (staff) there-even at night."
Hideaway Cafe,"Clean, convenient hours, friendly staff, plenty of machines"
Hideaway Cafe,Great place to work and drink coffee!  The salmon bagel is also good.  Come with or without your laundry.
Hideaway Cafe,"Washers are cool, dryers need a little work but aren't really as important.  Video games on weekends!"
Hideaway Cafe,"The owner is a Chinese woman. She speaks a little Mandarin, and teaches me how to use the machine. She is so kind and friends. Strongly recommend to people from Taiwan & China."
Hideaway Cafe,I've come here before and I've thought the place was lovely but today I got told off for being on the phone .... extremely rudely I might add
Hideaway Cafe,"Excellent places, they helped us to find touristic attraction, I charged my batteries too. The activated charcoal coffee was excellent."

Hideaway Cafe,"Possibility to have a coffee while waiting for your laundry to turn in the room below. Real coffee quite pleasant, pleasant welcome. Not too fast it is true. You can also eat simple meals. Clean toilets."
Hideaway Cafe,"We went to do our laundry, we were surprised to see that they also had a bar. The gentleman is really kind, he helped us with the laundry (with washing machine, soap, dryer...). And the pizzas that we ate prepared at the moment, delicious! A highly recommended place with a very good price!"
Hideaway Cafe,"Came here to wash my clothes during the trip, it's a very pleasant surprise. One of those places where it is ""good to live"". Come here and enjoy the peaceful and warm atmosphere and decor. while your laundry is washing. There is tea, coffee, latte, chocolate, breakfast, pizza, cakes & pastries, bagels, cold drinks & coffee or matcha lemonade with caffeine-free charcoal! The person who received me was really super friendly. And also wifi..."
Hideaway Cafe,How great it is to go do the laundry and meanwhile have a pizza made at the moment. Ideal for any time of the day
Hideaway Cafe,"It's not too far off the Strip, and the prices are the same as your average Laundromat, even though it's Las Vegas.  Not far from The Strip, also cheap."
Hideaway Cafe,Excellent attention
Hideaway Cafe,I loved
