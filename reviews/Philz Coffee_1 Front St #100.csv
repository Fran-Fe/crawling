Philz Coffee,Came here super early and there was basically no wait. Order was taken and came out real quick. Location is pretty chill and the staff was kind and allows dogs to chill inside.  Got a mint mojito and it was tasty. Very unique drink and worth the try if you've never had.
Philz Coffee,"They keep the doors open so I was slightly taken aback by the 2-3 flies that fluttered away when I went near the cashier. I usually get the Philtered Soul, and the taste was consistent with what I got before at another Philz coffee location.  They have a lot of seats, but this location is on the slightly smaller end."
Philz Coffee,Philz used to be one of the top coffee spots for me but as they got bigger….Coffee runs the gamut of amazing—so-so to downright bitter (excellent most of the time but it should be excellent all the time—do not always have the option of getting it re-made due to time).The staff is super friendly and helpful.The space is clean and well-maintained.Delicious pastries. ❤️Philtered soul and Dancing water
Philz Coffee,I love my coffee Black. Ty
Philz Coffee,Either gave me the wrong drink or that was the worst Tesora I've ever had. LA Phils coffee has way better quality than the SF one.
Philz Coffee,"This Philz isn’t so spacious, but it has some outside seatings. Also, as same as other locations, their WiFi is good. Of course, the taste of coffee is certainly Philz!! One good thing is this location isn’t so crowded compared to other Philz. When you go to the ball park (AT&T Stadium), this location is nice to stop by. Staffs are always nice and helpful to choose your coffee!!"
Philz Coffee,Excellent Coffee! Some of the best coffee I have ever had and the staff was extremely nice and helpful.
Philz Coffee,It is my favorite coffee for this time visiting SF. Its Mint Mojito and Sooo Good are the most special flavors I have ever tried before! I love the strong taste of mint. Highly recommend you MUST try these two flavors!
Philz Coffee,My go to is a nice hot Mint Mojito. Warms my soul! Cops come here in the afternoon and the seating gets somewhat limited. A few desk areas and outlets if you want to bring your laptop. But don't come here to work if you break out in dance when some good music blasts the stereo. Drank so fast I forgot to take a decent photo!
Philz Coffee,Fast service. Clean bathrooms. Friendly staff. 1lb coffee freshly ground $20.
Philz Coffee,"The driver pops out of Philz, I said ""you are literally parked next to a sign that says 'no stopping, tow away.' They can tow you."" The driver tells me, ""yeah, whatever."" The whole ally next to this truck had parking. Wreckless employees."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, good pricing, very friendly staff! Indoor/outdoor seating is limited (even for pre-pandemic times) but definitely a great place to get a coffee for your walk around Oracle Park!"
Philz Coffee,This Berry St. location is fantastic. Very friendly staff and always good coffee.
Philz Coffee,Highly recommend the almond croissant
Philz Coffee,Very nice and cozy place and very young and energetic baristas. I ordered hot mocha and it feels so good drinking it specially with a beautiful view of king street and very calm neighbor. Totally recommended.
Philz Coffee,I have to give the service a three-star I really don't go to Philz coffee but it was cold it was raining I need something hot something warm I was freezing I had no sweater they have on display a sweater and a t-shirt they refused to sell me their last sweater why have on display something for sale that you don't have and you refused to sell your last one...
Philz Coffee,"Coffee is okay but service can be a hit or miss. This is the only coffee shop in SF I keep having these awkward moments with the cashier and baristas all the time. One time I told them my name is John (my Starbucks name for convenience) and the coffee came named for ""sheik"", and I can only hope that it was an honest misunderstanding and not a reference to my accent."
Philz Coffee,"The ladies we’re great, very sweet and friendly! The coffee was delicious, amazing oat foam. I think it is worth the price! Definitely going back, one of the best Philz locations😋 …"
Philz Coffee,"Always amazing, just the best coffee around even in SF with a boutique roaster on every corner. Personal fave is Jacob's Wonderbar, black or Philz' Way, can't go wrong."
Philz Coffee,"Stopped for a quick coffee. Fast, friendly service"
Philz Coffee,Unique coffee selections that were delicious and very welcoming staff.
Philz Coffee,The place to be... For delicious made to order coffee!
Philz Coffee,"This place is STILL here after all these years! Yay, my coffe shop b4 the Caltrain stn. I couldn't get down to 22nd Stn bc the 22 Fillmore got rerouted after all these years. The 55 the newest line now goes that way. I am so confoozled, so thank GAWDAH for this Philz. I used to live in the park across the bridge b4 gentrification b4 the Ball Park was built and they bulldozed my parkinf lot at South Beach behind thr IBEW."
Philz Coffee,I got the coffee that has a hint of hazelnut.  I got it iced sweet and creamy and man is this worth it. You should definitely try this if you like hazelnut when you’re in San Fran! The blend is called Philtered  soul.
Philz Coffee,"Considering how long of a wait some of the Philz can be it was very quick and very tasty. It's not the most comfortable or nicely decorative environment but hopefully they'll change that soon?  Outside seating is a plus and staff are nice and very much good all around folks, but please just make it more welcoming and cozy."
Philz Coffee,"I ordered ""Mint Mojito Iced Coffee"". It was nice."
Philz Coffee,"Understaffed and overwhelmed. I waited 34 minutes past my mobile order pickup time. The order was comped but the wait time was unacceptable.  Edit: upon looking at my receipt, it turns out the order was only half comped. This place can’t even compensate correctly."
Philz Coffee,"The iced mocha is absolutely amazing! Their baked goods are equally good. Starting from the best : Poppy lemon slice, mini banana loaf, chocolate croissant, butter croissant, soft pretzel, seasonal fruit danish."
Philz Coffee,"Great cinnamon rolls (must tolerate raisins, and get it heated) and curated coffees and coffee drinks. Apparently easy to preorder and just breeze in to pick up but I didn't do that. Good croissant and blueberry muffin, too."
Philz Coffee,"Lovely staff, great atmosphere! Baristas were really pleasant and welcoming. You can’t go wrong at Philz"
Philz Coffee,"Philz is great.  I love this spot. Been coming here for years, it's right next to work. The staff is real friendly, and gives great recommendations.  They've been quite accommodating and safe throughout Covid as well. Their app is my prefered form of ordering at this point. I just order what I need while riding the T-Line to work, and it's usually ready earlier than predicted.  One of the many great places to get coffee in Mission Bay."
Philz Coffee,great coffee makes up for mediocre food
Philz Coffee,Nice clean place excellent selection of coffees
Philz Coffee,"Incredible, warm,  generous service makes the over the top, delicious coffee in all combinations unique to each visit even better.  If you like coffee and love warm, personalized, service and attention to detail,  get yourself to a Philz. Pro tip: Bring your own cup and pay for a small."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee and pastries, their baristas will do their best to make the coffee just the way you like it."
Philz Coffee,Not a good experience at this location. I go in and get my Mocha Tesora coffee. When I receive it. The drink taste like water. When I tell the guy at the register. He argued with me about the taste. This is the drink I get everytime I go to Philz coffee. So they make it again and taste like sugar water. Disappointing. Didn't want to waste anymore time. Just no going back to this location
Philz Coffee,"This is my first cup of the deliciousness called Philz Coffee! I've been in the Bay for 6yrs.... Why ever did I wait so long? The Mission Bay  location sits right on the corner and had cool vibe upon entering. The baristas were helpful and friendly. I also added an Almond Croissant, which of course was the perfect compliment. We need more locations in the E. Bay!? Overall I'm pleasantly pleased that my ""first"" time with Philz was pretty painless and felt really nice😜"
Philz Coffee,"I love Philz, and this location is no exception. Conveniently located by the Caltrain station, Mission Bay, China Basin, and public library, so a lot is at your fingertips!  Definitely worth a stop if you're on the hunt for caffeine. Philz is always my first choice for chain coffee when it's available.  I'm not a tea drinker but I have heard from my tea-drinking friends that their Chai is good. And of course the coffee is stellar and freshly-made! My go-to blends are Dancing Water, Tesora, or Mission Cold Brew."
Philz Coffee,"Philz Coffee is a great place to grab a quick, delicious breakfast. The baristas are friendly and the environment is open and appealing. It was clean and well kept despite being busy in the morning. I don't know about all of the items on their menu, but the sweet, creamy hot chocolate and cinnamon rolls are delightful."
Philz Coffee,"They have a great app for ordering, staff are always friendly. The turkey sausage egg white breakfast muffin is awesome. I think their food is a bit pricey but still a great place."
Philz Coffee,"Philz is the indie coffee shop closest to Caltrain station. I know there is another big brand coffee place (with a mermaid logo) nearby too. But by choice, I support smaller businesses. Local businesses are a priority for me. Philz offers wacky combinations of coffee beverages. I can get a simple tea 🍵 too; which I like. Sometimes you need a beverage to stay hydrated, to quench your thirst after your walk or run along King Street. Or sip a drink while watching the water flow by along the channel. Matcha tea is healthy. I like that it has green caffeine too. Most of the time rushing to/from Caltrain I don’t take my eye off getting from A to B. Those rare times I get to the area early, I’ll pop into Philz. A chill vibe. Good drinks. Snacks or even healthy food. A good choice."
Philz Coffee,Not the best Philz. Super tiny
Philz Coffee,This very location was my introduction to the world of Philz. Never knew coffee could taste so flavorful. Reading their menu board is like reading descriptions of fine wine. I had my very first Mint Mojito here - mint really goes well with coffee. This place has indoor and outdoor seating and can get really crowded with AT&T Park and Cal-Trains within walking distances besides all of the apartments and condos surround it. The staff is friendly and will make you a new coffee if you don't like what it tastes like.
Philz Coffee,"Tried the famous Mint Mojito. Umm, it's not coffee just a sugary drink"
Philz Coffee,The Philz Coffee on Berry is awesome!  Lots of interesting and delicious choices for coffee.  Plus the staff are super friendly and dedicated to making sure every customer enjoys their drink.  Great place to work or hang out.  Definitely coming back.
Philz Coffee,"Order your coffee in advance through the app :)   Great coffee choices, friendly staff, and a fun clean little shop make this one of my favorites in town.  The line is no worse than your average star bucks but their pour over coffee here is usually much better.  There isn't a ton of seating so don't count on getting a spot."
Philz Coffee,I love Philz.  It is my favorite thing about visiting my family in the bay area.  The coffee is so fresh!  The service is what you would expect from a coffee shop!  They have pastries and will warm them up for you!  Some coffees have MINT.  FRESH MINT!  Thank you Philz.  Bless you Philz.  Marry me Philz.
Philz Coffee,"Great, friendly service and tasty coffee. I walked up to the bar and hadn't decided what to get and asked for a quick recommendation. The barista was super friendly and she told me what her favorites were. I got the Philtered Soul and when she was done brewing it, she told me to taste the bubbles and let me know what I thought. It was a great tasting coffee, though I think it was flavored, which I wasn't expecting. Either way, I was really pleased with my order and the service!"
Philz Coffee,"Awesome drip-only coffee place. Definitely a bit different than the other, more typical espresso - centric places in the area. They have lots of choices (I got the Philtered Soul)  and I definitely plan to go back so I can try many of the other ones. The service was also great, and they made sure I was happy before I walked out."
Philz Coffee,I feel like it's a reward to myself everytime I step in this coffee shop.  I love their coffee! They have a long selection of roasts for you to choose from.  If your barrista does not make it the way you like it he/she will do their best to try to make it your way. This place rocks!
Philz Coffee,"The guy who made my coffee made it so hot it burned my tongue and started leaking through the bottom of the cup as I walked back to the office. In addition to that, the guy who took my order was wearing a hat that said ""BIP CITY"".  ""Bipping"", if you did not know, is a slang term for the act of breaking into a car with a ""bip tool"" (an escape device used if a car were to go underwater) to shatter the window and steal the valuables inside.  Given that Phil is from the city of San Francisco born and raised,  you would think that he would not want an employee of his, who is a representative of his brand, associating them self with that lifestyle which has been such a stain on the beautiful city & culture of San Francisco.  How disappointing."
Philz Coffee,You can't go wrong with a cup of Philz coffee but this location in particular is one of the best. Their blends are the epitome of perfection and they go through a lot to ensure each customer leaves with a cup of coffee that each customer loves. Each cup is individually brewed and tasted by the customer before leaving to ensure they are happy.
Philz Coffee,"You need the short wait in the long queue (it moves pretty quickly) to decide which of the many coffees they have on offer you'll choose. Never picked a bad one, all delicious. The staff is always friendly and it's a fun place to hang out."
Philz Coffee,"This Philz location has great service. Employees work as quickly as they can and do it with a smile, even though the lines can get long.  You'll get what you expect from this Philz location.  Note that the seating for this location is a bit more limited compared to others. The outside seating is pleasant."
Philz Coffee,Very good pastries and coffee.
Philz Coffee,"Most disgusting coffee I've ever had, everyone who goes here goes because it's the  non-trendy but  trendy place to be. It's like San Francisco's version of Starbucks. Coffee sucks and if you like it I think you have bad taste. Don't even try to get the other things they offer, I ordered a hot chocolate once and instead I got hot water with chocolate powder. So disappointed in San Francisco's taste in coffee."
Philz Coffee,"Get the mint mojito, super unique and tasty. 😋"
Philz Coffee,"I am homeless and currently in the city of San Francisco.  I sleep close to this location, and often workers at night will bring me pastries that they were going to throw out. I think it's so kind and considerate of them. All of their staff are super friendly and helpful. I bought a large Philtered Soul coffee this morning, and it was worth every penny. Hands down some of the freshest, richest coffee I have ever had. Thanks Philz!"
Philz Coffee,The coffee is delicious and individually prepared. Cream and sugar in perfect proportion also added if desired. I recommend the breakfast burrito and banana bread. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
Philz Coffee,"Lovely place! You get personalized attention and your cup of coffee is made for you right after you order it. This was my first time at a Philz, but it won't be my last."
Philz Coffee,"San Fran has AMAZING coffee and Philz is definitely an example of that. I really liked the ice mint mojito. I asked them to make it less sweet because I'm not really a fan of sweet drinks. The barista was super friendly about changing the drink and it turned out really delicious. I also thought the coffee itself was just excellent - it had a really deep, good, complex flavor. The fresh mint leaves were a nice touch, too."
Philz Coffee,"I love Philz. So. Much. The taste of their coffee is light and never over powering, and the caffeine keeps me going all day. I love all the flavors I have ever tried! And $3 for a small? Very happy indeed."
Philz Coffee,"This is the first time i sip an entirely different taste of coffee. It felt like i was in a long hike and taking a break absorbing the panoramic view of Mount Kilimanjaro. Its rich and creamy, i almost chewed the tea leaf in my coffee, yes a tea leaf in my coffee."
Philz Coffee,"I don't usually drink coffee but I cannot not have a iced Mint Mojito coffee at Philz. It's so creamy and minty that it is so refreshing and yummy. I enjoy just sitting outside and watch the dogs come and go. They also have dog biscuits for the dog. This location does get very crowded in the mornings and afternoons so expect to wait for like 10 to 15 mins but service is still pretty fast. More importantly, it's so yummy!"
Philz Coffee,"When I want a cup of coffee made JUST FOR ME, this is where I go.  These folks are dedicated to making each customer that cup of coffee that is just the way they like it.  So it takes a few minutes longer.  But then, it's perfect.  Add a Peeples donut (Philz flavor!) and you've got the magic morning mix of sugar and caffeine to tackle anything."
Philz Coffee,"Very kind service, lovely little place for a quick breakfast or a coffee."
Philz Coffee,It may be a little off the beaten path—but that seems to be the occasion for Philzs; they’re like hidden gems. Can a coffee shop like Philz get any more authentic. With amazing customer service and great coffee to match—one of the best coffee shops in SOMA/China Basin.
Philz Coffee,"The coffee isn't that great despite all the fancy names, plus it costs a lot, but I guess that's a Bay Area issue. The avocado toast is good as are the pastries.  The whole order with the barista then repeat your order to pay then wait for someone to inaudibly call your name is clunky and weird though."
Philz Coffee,highly recommended to try Philz mint mojito. surprisingly tasty and refreshing!
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee is one of my favorite coffee places in the San Francisco Bay Area. This restaurant is always packed. The line can be very long, but the coffee is worth it. There is not a lot of seating at this particular field. Because of its downtown location, the restaurant is always full."
Philz Coffee,"Came here searching for some decent coffee and something to eat.  Decided to go on a chocolate binge and grab a mocha tesora and chocolate croissant. Was not disappointed!  Probably one of the best mochas I've ever had and the croissant was superb, too.  The line was out the door but moved quickly. The ordering process is a bit confusing for someone who's never been before, but seemed to work in some kind of organised chaos way.  The staff were super friendly and nice and I even managed to get a seat (though probably arriving after most start work had something to do with that).  Definitely hit it up if you need a good coffee fix."
Philz Coffee,"great location since there is not much else around this area. the rumors are true...the coffee here is excellent. Haven't really tried much else, but it all looks good. They have some outdoor seating and the store is fairly spacious."
Philz Coffee,"Busy just like every other one I've ever seen. I'm still new to Philz but I LOVE the mint mojito, always sweet and creamy. Best thing ever, coffee-wise. I'm hooked!"
Philz Coffee,"Love Philz coffee! Their 24th street location is the original but the same coffee and experience is served here as well. This is close to the ballpark and the 280 freeway access hence on my way to work and back home. I usually stop by here in the evenings, get some beans and grab a cup to warm me up!"
Philz Coffee,"Australians (and Italians) - avoid. In my opinion, if you like ristretto shots or espresso, Australian or Italian espresso-based coffees, Philz is not the place for you. They do not do espresso (of any sort), long blacks, lattes, cappuccinos, or anything resembling actual coffee.  Asking Philz to produce decent tasting coffee is like asking a fish to climb a tree. It's not coffee, it's something else. If you like whatever it is that Philz is serving, and by the glowing reviews here, it seems many do, more power to you. It's just not coffee.  Upon entering the store, you get the strong vibe they really believe they are the bees knees and far too cool to serve plebs. I can tolerate some hubris if there is skill, decent beans well roasted, with a skillfully made and memorable espresso at the end. Philz has none of these qualities.  First you have to work out you don't order and pay and then wait for a coffee like any normal place, but instead you have to wait. I had to watch others for a few minutes to work this out because there are two separate areas to wait, and it's not clear if there's a line or how people are called up. At this point, I'm still not clear on how this works.  You have to wait in area #2 for a barista to deign to notice you. They are far too busy preparing someone else's drinks to serve anyone, and it seems like a lot of trouble to the barista to actually serve you when it's beyond time. There are passive aggressive signs everywhere warning you to not hassle the staff as they will call you when they're ready. Eventually, they do.  I asked for an espresso, which is my go to when figuring out a) can I trust a new place near where I work to make my 3-5 coffees a day and thus become my go-to recommend place to friends and clients? b) what do the beans and roast taste like? I drink a lot of coffee and life's too short to tolerate bad beans or a terrible roast or a button presser instead of a barista c) can they make a decent coffee in a style that has literally nowhere to hide? In short, 0-3 with Philz.  The ""barista"" told me straight up they don't do espresso, and made me feel like that I was stupid and wrong to ask for one. After I experienced their coffee, it was ultra clear they don't know SFA about coffee let alone espresso.  Some considerable time later after placing your order, your ""barista"" will have passed lukewarm water over some flavored grinds, and you'll get a weak ""coffee"" that tastes of sadness and regret. Really, to my palate, it's soft, weak, no stringent or acidic notes, at least 300 ml of luke warm flavored water. There are obvious hints of the flavoring. I went for the Jacob's Wonderbar, and although they promised a dark roast with a hint of nuts and chocolate, the only real notes I could perceive was like it was a weak Nescafe Blend 43 you might get from a vending machine with a backwash of carob or dark chocolate. I saw the grinds, so it wasn't Nescafe Blend 43, but you still get the picture. I can understand if you don't like acidic dark blends or stringent / aromatic coffee why this might appeal to some, but it seemed like it was a lot of water for not much coffee.  At this point, you need to work out where to stand to be called up to pay for this cup of something that is not coffee. This is by far the easiest step, but suffice to say, I didn't finish my cup. After I returned to my desk, I had a push button espresso from the machine at work and that was easily 1000% better than what I poured down the sink.  If you like coffee, skilled baristas, or just like being treated as a human by your barista, go literally anywhere else. Just terrible. I will not be back."
Philz Coffee,"Worst chai I’ve ever had at any Philz Coffee location. I even had the girl remake it because I paid for a large and she made a small. She still made the same watery foamless debri-filled tea-imposter in a bigger cup. And with sass. They usually ask you to taste it to make sure it’s good. And they’ll happily remake it if it is not. But not here, or maybe just not her. She probably didn’t shake the heavy whipping cream carton like she was trained to do because she was in a rush, but there was little to no line. I dumped it in the trash outside the right door after tasting it. Lately(past 4 years), the quality of Philz is shaky. It really depends on the barista you happen to get. My friend Trinity used to work at this location which is why I stop here over other locations. But now she don’t work here no more and I’m over it. They get an extr star because I still love their coffee on their good days"
Philz Coffee,"Friendly staff, top caliber coffee made by the cup. Couldn't ask for more. Glad I took the walk to get there."
Philz Coffee,"My favorites are the mint mojito which is an iced coffee, Tesora (which is their original blend, medium roast), and Philtered Soul which is a sweet dark roast with traces of hazelnut. I like how you can tailor how sweet you want your coffee to be. At any time of day there always seems to be a long line here! I've had their breakfast food here and it's not too bad."
Philz Coffee,"Fantastic experience! 1st time at Philz will definitely go again. Great service by the staff, super friendly and helpful. Staff accentuates to the phenom coffee and teas they sell!! Superb!"
Philz Coffee,"I ask how they make the hot chocolate ""we use cream"" the person said.  I thought ""wow, rich I'll try that"" and I ordered it. I watched the person make it with hot water and pour a bit of cream in at the end. It was disgusting!"
Philz Coffee,Busy corner location near the ball park and China Basin. Staff is friendly. Menu is standard (drip coffee and hot tea only). Seating is limited. Parking is available on the street (difficult) or in a garage. I wouldn’t plan on having a business meeting here as you most likely won’t have a table.
Philz Coffee,"The Philz fresh chai is so good it will ruin buying chai tea from any normal coffee shop. The staff at Philz is always wonderful and their drinks are consistent. Is philz the most San Francisco thing ever with their ambiance, decor, and expensive drinks? Totally. But that's why you love it!"
Philz Coffee,"I absolutely LOVE Philz! Whatever they put in the coffee just makes it amazing. My usual is the #5 mocha tesora:  It's the perfect blend of rich expresso and chocolate taste, and you can customize the sweetness. The baristas there know how to make coffee and they are extremely nice about making sure you like it before you leave the place."
Philz Coffee,"Love the mint mojito here. Not usually into sweet coffee, but I enjoy getting it sweet and creamy. Never had mint and coffee before, and it really works."
Philz Coffee,"Delicious coffee. I tend to think of coffee less as a beverage and more as a caffeine delivery tool. So as long as it isn't offensively bad, it's fine. But lordy, they make a good cup of Joe here! Just watch out for the more bizarre ""hints"" of flavors. They can often be quite strong."
Philz Coffee,"I love philz! And this is the least busy location. Line moves quick, usually there is no where to sit inside. Usually people sit at the outside tables or take their coffee to go. They have a large selection of drinks. The food selection is also large but I've never seen anyone order food at philz."
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee is one of the best coffee choices anywhere. I'd recommend listening to the staff choices before making a selection since the flavors vary considerably. If you like syrupy non-chai extra whips whatevers, go to Starbucks - if you love coffee, come to Philz."
Philz Coffee,"It all started in 2007 when I was visiting one of my close friends that lived near this coffee location before work. I met Jacob--he’s so sweet, and he brewed me his blend, “Jacob’s blend” and I’ve been hooked since then. I’ve been raving about this place to all of my friends (all of whom agree), co-workers, and family about how awesome this coffee and coffeehouse is. I think it was several years later when their locations spread (meaning they opened up more locations to spread the joy of their awesome coffee) to Van Ness, Berkeley and Palo Alto that everyone finally caught on. This place brews some of the best coffee that I have ever had. I also love Julie’s blend and Ether. This location is also central to Mission Bay/SOMA as you have the Cal Train within walking distance from this place."
Philz Coffee,"I love coffee and have been frequenting Philz more because I've had to switch to decaf.  Philz has an assortment of decaf coffee but I come for one in particular.  Their Swiss Water Peru. It's a dark roast decaf and it's water processed instead of chemically processed like most decaf coffees.  Service is always great at all the Philz locations, this one included."
Philz Coffee,"The iced mint mojito coffee is the best! I would recommend customizing it by saying ""light sweetness"" because this brings out the coffee and mint flavor. I would also recommend the mocha tesora for a ""heavier"" version because it's very chocolate-y, but is probably one of the better mocha coffees I've had."
Philz Coffee,"Had a terrible coffee there which I couldn't finish and made me very nauseous. I threw up and had the rest of a terrible day and night feeling an insane cafeine high. I'm a huge coffee drinker and I have never reacted like this to coffee before. Regarding the ambience, it's nice. I found the barista a bit pretencious but I wouldn't have minded that if the coffee didn't make me sick."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, cake, decor and especially music. Let this adrift backpackers get some much needed WiFi for a couple of hours"
Philz Coffee,"An eclectic and tasty brewhouse. Coffees are separated by strength -- dark, medium, and light. They also serve with fresh mint leaves in certain brews. For drip, this would be my first recommendation in San Francisco."
Philz Coffee,"The location is really good. I sometimes need to wait for Caltrain more than 30 min, so I can grab a cup of coffee. I like Turkish coffee at Philz. The baristas here are friendly."
Philz Coffee,"Love Philz Coffee! It's all drip coffee and made one at a time. I love their mocha tesora and mint mojito drink. So many coffee bean options. You can buy beans by the pound and they will grind them for you if you wish. Right next to the CalTRain area, so perfect pit stop when you get on or off."
Philz Coffee,"Coffee lovers, you really want to try out this place if you haven't already. My wife and I do not have tea/coffee during weekdays but every saturday we do make it a point to have coffee/tea and we end up going to Philz 90% of the time.  Our favorite drink is Iced Mint Mojito, sweet and creamy. It isnt served with any alcohol but it has fresh mint served with coffee which makes the coffee taste twice as good. Cops, nerds, etc are to be seen frequently at this location and the lines can get long but at such times you have some apps to help you order ahead and skip the lines.  Another favorite of mine is Chai tea latte made earthy and spicy. Its unlike any other chai tea latte found at other big brand coffee shops (I am referring to you Starbucks and Peets)."
Philz Coffee,Phil drops in every once in a while. I love the workers there. Extremely personable and they know their coffee! Ask them for their favorite mixed blend. I had the Philtered Soul. WOW! LEGIT!
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee, how can I say it?  I love you You make me happy when I am blue You dazzle me with your mint mojito I love you more than (dare I say it) a taco bell taco shell made from dorito  OK, Philz is a MUST and this location is one of the best.  The servers are good, fast and you get in and out more or less.  You can also mix beans and ask for a secret menu of drinks like silk and soul or red haze.  This Silk and Soul is one of the best (not to be mistaken with ""it's the best"" drink :)"
Philz Coffee,"I almost wish I never tried this place because it brings coffee to a higher level, and good old Peet's will just never be the same. Seriously, what do they put in this coffee? And I don't say this just because this is the latest circle J that we San Franciscans tend to fall into over trendy places, but because it really is the greatest coffee ever.  I'm finding myself increasingly walking past the Peet's across the street from me in favor of the 1/2 mile trek to Philz."
Philz Coffee,"Philz opened my eyes to just how delicious coffee can be! The baristas here are more like bartenders making each cup exactly to your liking. Their blends are really flavorful and completely unique. You must try the mocha tersora, philtered soul, and gingersnap. If you're not sure what to get, just refer to their menu board which describes each blend with 3 adjectives.  The location is really convenient, just a couple blocks away from the CalTrain."
Philz Coffee,"Truthfully Philz is my neighborhood go to, but I had a bad experience the other day, I ordered a particular coffee but it tasted like something else. We all have off days so I will be going back, but Philz I'm watching you"
Philz Coffee,"My local caffeine haunt. Staff are awesome and welcoming. Usually very busy, but the staff quick and charming. Philtered Soul is my top pick. So tasty."
Philz Coffee,Coffee is very good but expensive. Friendly staff
Philz Coffee,"Consistently good coffee, nice baristas who know what they are talking about, lively buzz in the cafe. Lines can be long since each cup is brewed fresh, worth the wait if you like coffee."
Philz Coffee,"Really good coffee. The turkish coffee comes with fresh mint. Total difference experience. Wait can be a little, but everyone knows its the best coffee around when the cops line up."
Philz Coffee,"Obviously Philz is pretty famous in our fair city. Their regular coffees are good, but if you really want to have your mind blown, try the gingersnap iced coffee. You can thank me later."
Philz Coffee,They're unlike every other coffee joint. In the good way. Treat yourself.
Philz Coffee,Good quality coffee house with Wi-Fi and a fair number of seats
Philz Coffee,I was told by a friend that I met on a train from Palo Alto to try this place while in town attending a TechCrunch event. The Mint Mojito coffee was spectacular! I tried it out after we arrived from Palo Alto. Will be coming back next time I am in town!
Philz Coffee,"Bump into Phil here all the time. He loves to hang around and chat with the customers. Great location, but gets kinda crowded especially during the games. Line moves at a decent clip though.  Favorites are the Ecstatic Ice and Philtered Soul."
Philz Coffee,I completely understand the ADDICTION...Philz has the BEST coffee IN TOWN...individually dripped and customized.  My favorites are: + Jacob's Wonder + Mocha Tesora + Ice Mint Mojito + Fresh Mint Tea with cream & honey
Philz Coffee,"I love this Philz location that sits in a neighborhood with Tech companies, the ball park, CalTrain, WholeFoods, and Panera. Has this one the funkiest employees or what? Consistent drink quality throughout - my favorite, the TRANQUILIZING TURKISH (no sugar, a little bit of cream, $3) is bold and strong, almost black, like a good coffee needs to be. My other favorite is the GREATER ALARM ($3), which guarantees max caffeine intake, a little bit on the nutty side.  Glad Philz made it to this neighborhood."
Philz Coffee,"Great place for good coffee. Very nice staff. Try the iced mint mojito coffee!  The menu looks intimidating a first, but don't worry, the staff will help you through it :)"
Philz Coffee,"Definitely the best coffee in the Bay area. You pay a little more but you get a little more, a good cup of coffee is worth it. I just wish they had a rewards program on the app"
Philz Coffee,"I've never been a fan of coffee and whenever I did get coffee I would fill it with cream and sugar until the flavor of the coffee was masked.  I went on a variant of the paleo diet though and started working red bull out of my system but still wanted caffeine.  Before I went on the diet I found I liked Philz with a little cream and sugar.  I could tell there was something beneath the cream and sugar though and that coffee can have a very good, very distinct flavor and not suck.  I also liked coffee with cream and sugar from places like Blue Bottle, Ritual, 4 Barrel etc... but it was Philz that shone like a beacon in the darkest of nights when I needed to go completely black for the diet.  I rarely get cups of coffee from here any more so this is mainly a rating on their roasts.  I started off with Ambrosia as a cup made by them and it's, well, the nectar of the gods.  I use a coffee press when I'm in the office or at home though so they recommended Jakob's Wonderbar Brew to me and it is what converted me to the dark side.  This coffee has so many flavors, some subtle, some in your face, that really made me realize coffee is more than just burned water.  Scalding hot it's got this insta-wakeup bitterness to it but as it cools down more and more flavors come out and by the time it's easy to chug without burning anything but not cold enough to want to toss it in the microwave for a few seconds it has this nutty, earthy, rich flavor with absolutely no bitterness and puts me in a place, some sort of meditative state, that only tea has been able do to me before.  Today I picked up a pound of Julie's to see how that fares in the coffee press since that was the other blend they recommended to me.  In conclusion, drink Philz.  Only Philz.  There is no coffee but Philz and it is the one true coffee."
Philz Coffee,"I was visiting San Francisco and someone took me took me here. They said this place was the go to coffee shop for SOMA and San Francisco. I tired the Gingersnap ice coffee, it was delicious! This place is nice and open! Only thing is the order line and pick up is a little bit of a mess."
Philz Coffee,"Delectable chain in San Francisco that really knows thier stuff. Kind of Giants in my mind as employees, ordering process, menu, and flavors we're uniquely expressive of this city, and from my tourist vantage, unlocked key qny shop I had ever seen anywhere. Recomend the mojito vold"
Philz Coffee,".Don't get me wrong, the ambience and staff are pleasant enough, but $4.77 for medium sized coffee?  Not $2 better than Peet's. Absurd over-priced gimmick."
Philz Coffee,Coffee is excellent and the service is great but the space feels messy and haphazard and not a place I'd like to relax in.
Philz Coffee,"Very fast, Kind people, Nice coffee!"
Philz Coffee,"Hands down the best coffee, and Philz coffee location there is. The canopy of heaven is divine if you want a lighter coffee, but the Philharmonic, Tesora are good choices too -- with cream and sugar, of course!"
Philz Coffee,Love the Philz Bagel - get one every weekend; such a great deal! The Mint Mojito is also delicious and the 5'Oh cookies :)
Philz Coffee,My favorite place for coffee in the SF Bay Area. Quickly replaced Blue Bottle. I get the Silken Splendor or the Mocha Tesora if I'm craving something sweet.
Philz Coffee,This location is smaller compared to the other spots in the Peninsula & SF. I like that there is more outdoor seating here with shade. Plus its a hop & a skip away from the 4th & King St Caltrain station.
Philz Coffee,"Pluses:  Strong, tasty coffee.  Friendly baristas.  Tasty snacks.  Close walk from Caltrain. Minuses:  Very limited seating.  Has a tip jar, which I find a bit offputting; pay your workers a fair wage with a good compensation plan and charge what you gotta charge.  Not much drink selection for non-coffee drinkers (e.g., no steamers, hot cider, etc.)"
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee and friendly service. The prices are steep here, so it's more of a treat than a daily thing. I always go for the mojito."
Philz Coffee,"Philz did single-cup pour-overs before it was cool, and as it happens I think they remain the best at it. I think the 24th Street flagship location is the most consistent, but I've relied on this outpost quite a bit as well."
Philz Coffee,"Try ordering before you get there. Bring your own cup to always get the small cup, and get the breakfast burrito. All little tricks of the trade. Another mint mojito please!"
Philz Coffee,"Delicious single serve coffee, kinda pricey but worth it."
Philz Coffee,"Philz has excellent coffee and great selection. And, unusually, they have a good variety of decaf options as well, in case you like coffee but not caffeine jitters."
Philz Coffee,You gotta experience the 'pour over' at Philz at least once... but beware.  It may be habit forming.  Friendly folks abound.  Food choices are include both sweet and savory.  My fav flavs are Tesora and Ether both with cream.
Philz Coffee,"A Bay Area must-stop coffee shop! The product, people and ambiance are fantastic! Recommendation: Dancing Water 50/50. You'll love it!"
Philz Coffee,Highly recommended coffee shop in the area! I am one of your regular clients who keep on ordering your mochaccino and chocolate muffin.
Philz Coffee,"Mint mohito is the good stuff!! Very sweet tho, if you're not a sweet tooth, ask for less sweetener. Trust me, it'll still be plently sweet!!"
Philz Coffee,The gingersnap iced coffee is one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had in my entire life. Good selection of pastries and baked goods.
Philz Coffee,My fave is the silken splendor + philtered soul combo!
Philz Coffee,Great coffee with nice and large space to work.
Philz Coffee,Took 30 minutes to get a coffee. Staff ver slow. Worst coffee experience I’ve had.
Philz Coffee,This is my fourth time there the coffee is great the tantalize Turkish but without mint so this is my 4th time and every time I say no mint but they still put the mint in it I had to burn my hand to take the mint out I guess if the customer says no mint it means no mint
Philz Coffee,"Their coffee is so difference. I so love it. And try the iced mint mojito coffee, is cool. But sis just say soso. But in San Francisco you should try them"
Philz Coffee,"I met Phil once and he let me take a picture with him, but he insisted that I place the logo of my Philz cup out toward the camera. Dude gets marketing, and luckily his coffee matched his enthusiasm for promotion."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee made to your liking. The staff here is very friendly. Can be crowded at times, but well worth your wait."
Philz Coffee,Solid iced coffee. Friendly staff!
Philz Coffee,"Amazing choice of coffees and blends and a great atmosphere in the place. Would have liked to see some espresso options though, not just all filter."
Philz Coffee,Small corner Philz just down from the King Street Caltrain station.  Friendly staff and fresh pastries.  Get there early if you want a seat!
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, like every Philz I’ve visited. And great staff! Always a smile and very polite."
Philz Coffee,Very confusing ordering process but still worth the hassle.
Philz Coffee,Top notch customer service. I came in here late for a meeting soaking wet and they let me borrow an umbrella for the whole day. Said just to bring it back tomorrow!
Philz Coffee,"Really friendly staff, delicious coffee blends, lots of natural light to study, and lots of traffic to people-watch. I'm definitely addicted to the Greater Alarm."
Philz Coffee,My favorite place to WFH when I'm in SF: this is where I go when I'm craving my Jacob's Wonderbar Philz Way and a bacon breakfast burrito. I just happened to meet the man himself when I was here one time. It made my week!
Philz Coffee,This is a great local coffee chain. Had the Philtered Soul and Gingersnap Iced Coffee. Both were great.
Philz Coffee,The staff here are so nice and always take care of you. Neighborhood coffee at It’s finest.
Philz Coffee,"Pretty good drip coffee. 20+ different flavors from around the world. Lines are badly organised, no espresso drinks."
Philz Coffee,"Had an amazing ice mojito coffee. Plus they gave out a free drink randomly and I took it! Felt a bit hopped up afterwards, but that's what I get for drinking 2 coffees"
Philz Coffee,Great coffee but three stars cause it's to small for people to stay as long as they do at that location just to use Wi-Fi
Philz Coffee,Extremely limited seating and electrical outlets. I look forward to the day when the movement of our body or the energy in light can charge our smartphones so I don't have to hunt an electrical plug down like some kind of illegal poacher.
Philz Coffee,"Philz makes great coffee, but this location had 4 people behind the bar and only one making coffee even though there was a line....   😳🥴 …"
Philz Coffee,Very well brewed coffees with great staff and baristas! It's a bit on the pricey side though but worth it!
Philz Coffee,Great service but best of all one of my favorite breakfast to get. Mediterranean avocado toast w their coffee!
Philz Coffee,"Its Philz, so great coffee is a given. The X factor here is the service, which may be the best among all of the Philz locations in the bay area."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, but they no longer have the jalapeno cheddar bagels. If they bring those back its 5/5!"
Philz Coffee,"The coffee I had was a little heavy on the nutmeg side. But otherwise, it was good and very smooth.  A good place to spend a sunday morning."
Philz Coffee,"Stupidly crowded, even on weekends. Not a lot of indoor seating. Coffee is unremarkable. Great place to meet hipsters!"
Philz Coffee,The Mint Mojito iced coffee and Ancho Chili Burrito w/Tapatio sauce packet are my fav!😋 …
Philz Coffee,Pouring water on cardboard to dissuade homeless from taking it to sleep on and keep warm and night. Also a very rude supervisor who completely lied and brushed off my questions.
Philz Coffee,"Philz is an institution. However, they focus mainly on different flavors of coffee. Coffee Geeks should check out réveille down the road"
Philz Coffee,They do things with drip coffee that will make you look at your cup and say 'yooooo! What's in this? How'd you make this?!?!?'. 24th Street locale actually explains their process on their signage.
Philz Coffee,"Great people, great coffee but a little tight inside. I would recommend mobile ordering."
Philz Coffee,Nice environment to relax and get some work done. The chai tea is a good option. Wish there were more indoor seats.
Philz Coffee,Amazing variety of black coffee flavours and a cozy place for a chat but not the best atmosphere for a self-study. Wifi can be better.
Philz Coffee,"I really dont understand why people love this place. Coffee is okay, figuring out my coffee order and pickup weird. Food was mediocre. Not even the best chain."
Philz Coffee,"I have a need to joke around. I call the tea I order quiz tea because of all the choices and selection. They always smile,and make my tea perfectly."
Philz Coffee,Hard to go wrong with a mint mohito when the mint is so fresh :-)
Philz Coffee,My fav hang out place!!! Coffee is the best! My fav is philharmonic and 'soo good' the staff is so knowledgable and enthusiastic!! They are so good with recommendations :-))
Philz Coffee,"Amazing coffee, friendly staff sometimes busy af but worth the wait (and cost)"
Philz Coffee,One of my all time favorite coffee spots in SF. Has a slick outdoor area to chill and people watch
Philz Coffee,Delicious blend of coffee and pastries were fresh!  Staff was very nice & polite.
Philz Coffee,Some pretty good drip coffee. Friendly staff for sure
Philz Coffee,"It's a Philz, but this location is new and clean. My biggest issue is lack of space to sit. It's not very cozy because of the chaos outside due to proximity to Caltrain and SoMa."
Philz Coffee,"Good coffee, but sadly bad customer service. They could be great if they trained their staff appropriately."
Philz Coffee,Great place for amazing coffee. Philtered soul and mint mojito are my go to's
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, and they also do a nice job of keeping the line moving when morning commuters fill the place."
Philz Coffee,"Something went wrong in the app.  Phil's didn't get confirmation until the 3rd try.  Very frustrating, I could've just ordered in the store."
Philz Coffee,"Service is best, but it is the quality of the coffee that sets Philz apart. Love the Tesora and Jacob's Wonderbar"
Philz Coffee,"Coffee is always delicious, but do expect to wait a minimum of 5 minutes (more if the place is crowded) for your individually brewed cup."
Philz Coffee,Oh yes coffeee please give me more coffee. I liked this place when visited. I would come back
Philz Coffee,"Hands down, the best coffee around! Try the Jacob's Wonderbar with hazelnut. SO GOOD!!"
Philz Coffee,I just watched the staff here take cardboard outside and dump water on it so the homeless can't use it to sleep on.. What is wrong with people? I will never go there again..
Philz Coffee,"Good coffee, free high speed wifi, ample outlets, a comfy couch and nice staff. What more do you need in a cafe?"
Philz Coffee,"Mostly just coffee, good restaurant but only go here if coffee is pretty much all you're looking for. Not a big variety of snacks or other drinks"
Philz Coffee,"Convenient location, right next to the caltrain station. Close to almost everything. Great coffee as usual, and great crowd."
Philz Coffee,I not a coffee drinker but they make a great iced Chai. Employees are great. Cool vibe
Philz Coffee,"Their iced ecstatic is delicious! Baked goods are pretty tastey, but nothing super special."
Philz Coffee,Amazing coffee and great service. If the line is long don't worry it goes fast!
Philz Coffee,"Incredible coffees, great atmosphere, and friendly staff. What else could you want in a coffee shop?"
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, as always, and convenient location when you're waiting for (or just getting off) Caltrain."
Philz Coffee,Good coffee. But don’t go here if you are in a rush. Takes forever.
Philz Coffee,"It's Philz. Good coffee and good service, but not cheap."
Philz Coffee,I'm trying not to be so trendy these days but it don't get any better than this even just for a regular cup of black coffee that I frequent on a daily basis.  Thx Philz!
Philz Coffee,"Busy but fast service. Wish there was more seating, but otherwise a good place to grab a coffee in that neighborhood"
Philz Coffee,Probably come here multiple times a week. They have a Harry Potter theme going on at the moment. Love the ecstatic
Philz Coffee,The best coffee around. Quality single brew crafted to order. Hip vibe.
Philz Coffee,Coffee was nasty. I've tasted so much better.
Philz Coffee,"Love coming here for coffee. Early in the morning, I always use the app to order ahead."
Philz Coffee,Coffee is weak and tasteless. Waited 20 minutes for a pricey cup of coffee
Philz Coffee,Interesting flavors at a fair price. A good place for coffee!
Philz Coffee,Never go into this location did not even know it was out this way I just arrived back to sf and I am homeless looking for a dry slab of concrete to sleep on fiund it
Philz Coffee,Lots of choices for a relatively decent price. Great environment for a social meetup. Great service from the baristas.
Philz Coffee,"Lovely coffee place! Great staff, fantastic coffee and delicious bagels."
Philz Coffee,Place is packed sound 9 am with long lines. I would recommend coming here earlier if you can. Friendly staff!
Philz Coffee,"Interesting drinks. And bizarre ordering method (queue here, give the order to this guy, then move to the left to pay, and move to the right to wait...)"
Philz Coffee,Their mint mojito is good but I think overall their coffee is overated.
Philz Coffee,"Really extensive coffee menu with live grinding and brewing, worth a visit or three"
Philz Coffee,Great coffee and hot chocolate. Staff are also really friendly
Philz Coffee,The Philtered Soul is the perfect way to start the day. Excellent made to order coffee.
Philz Coffee,Philz us always  a great choice.  All the staff are extremely warm and friendly.
Philz Coffee,Very good hot chocolate which actually tastes like hot chocolate rather than hot milk and sugar.
Philz Coffee,Love philz coffee. Place usually crowded. Friendly staff.
Philz Coffee,"Line is always crazy long and out the door, but the coffee is absolutely worth the wait."
Philz Coffee,I go here every Saturday and Sunday to get an iced coffee - I'm pretty hooked.
Philz Coffee,Cool place.. fantastic variety of flavors and very friendly staffs.
Philz Coffee,"Coffee was too hot and environment isn't as friendly as mission district location. Also, no one is busting tables."
Philz Coffee,Baristas are always nice and never have a problem with you settling in for a few hours
Philz Coffee,Top notch crafting quality as usual. It is hard to fond parking spot for this location
Philz Coffee,"Great spot, I am out of town consultant. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Incredible atomsphere"
Philz Coffee,"Always great coffee, served with care and hospitality. Thanks Philz!"
Philz Coffee,"Java monkey riding you? But don't care for Safeway's blends, or the upscale stuff at the stadium? Here is an alternative."

Philz Coffee,"Love the selection of coffee at this Philz in particular. Get ""dancing water"" ☕️✨"
Philz Coffee,I got a tea this time but besides the drinks the service is always friendly.
Philz Coffee,+1 for Philz Iced Mint Mojito Coffee.... whoever invented this drink is genius
Philz Coffee,Nothing complicated. Decent black drip coffee.
Philz Coffee,A big Philz with limited seating. But they do have a pick up counter for those who order before they go in.
Philz Coffee,"Good pour over coffee, nice people, a bit lacking in the food department"
Philz Coffee,I ordered a hot choc and it was horrible :( it seems like they used ‘water’ instead milk.
Philz Coffee,LOVE this place! Great vegan options and super nice people.

Philz Coffee,"The place is super nice, it is also Pet friendly. The coffees are all very good and the bakery is also excellent. 10/10"
Philz Coffee,"There is free wifi that needs to be logged in, and the toilet needs to ask for a password. The corner coffee shop is a bit small, but you can feel warm, and the shop assistants are also very kind."
Philz Coffee,It is the first place I visited in my tour of San Francisco at 7 AM it was open and I had an exquisite Latte coffee. Very good vibes from the girls who attended me. I hope to be able to return some other time
