Peet's Coffee,"Great staff and products, but the recent redesign ruined it.  This used to be the best coffee shop in the area for strong drip coffee and tasty snacks, but now the remodel made it into a digital coffee factory where you can’t order with a human, you can’t see any of the food products, and the workers are trapped behind a big wall. Too bad, the staff there is amazing and deserves better."
Peet's Coffee,"The redesign with digital ordering screens is impersonal and you can't see any staff to ask questions. And it's just sad that all the digital menu items show coffee in china and glass cups because it looks and tastes better, but you can only get your coffee in awful single-use containers."
Peet's Coffee,"Monday - Friday this PEETS is one block from work!  Best Peet's employees in The City!  Please tip your baristas, salaries are not enough to live on in San Francisco 🌁🌉"
Peet's Coffee,"This place has the best selection of coffee in town. I love a good, vibrant, dark roast - and here, I dont have one choice, I have many options. I love it. They also have wireless access and the best soup (hard to find in SF, if you ask me) and sammies. Great art displays deck the walls and the crowd is cool."
Peet's Coffee,"I love Peets coffee but Jeff make me hate Pete’s coffee place specially this location I have to wait for my coffee for 10 minutes , I was in the front line with the large crowd and I was the last person to get my coffee after I placed my order first. When as what happened to my order Jeff claiming is a mobile order my understanding if you order on Mobile pay it on line you don’t have to come and pay at the cashier but I was watching how Jeff running the place is the worst place to buy a coffee they not professional specially Jeff the manager . I will make sure my family and friends and Co-work do not come to this place. Anytime my calendar is always the same I fed up I’m not coming back to this place. Worst place ever."
Peet's Coffee,"I try using a ""Happy Bites"" gift card which clearly states I can use it at Peet's Coffee, but the cashier was too lazy to read the instructions on how to use the gift card and he denied my purchase. So I walked out, it was very embarrassing. Funny thing is that a few blocks down, another Peet's Coffee location took the gift card with no problems."
