Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"This place is a solid coffee shop, but rather small. There are no tables to sit down so you are forced to just buy your coffee and leave the shop. I was a little intimidated by the servers as 3 of them are standing in front of the register waiting for my order. I enjoyed the coffee and the quick service though."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Hours shown are incorrect. Showed up on Saturday at 3:30 and they were closed. Very good looking place from what I could see from the window.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,If you're looking for a great cup of coffee not a place to hang out this is the place to go. There's limited seating and this extremely well stuffed small coffee shop. Excellent espresso drinks as well as pour overs. And it looks like they're adding machka tea lattes to their menu. They only have a few baked goods but from what I sampled they're all very tasty.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,In a city full of artisan coffee shops-wrecking ball is my favorite.Expect perfectly roasted and brewed coffee. 👎no heavy cream option 🌺great coffee spot! …
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Today 01/16 I went to Wrecking  ball at Union St for my regular hot chocolate. As I walked outside the store I had my first sip and it was salty. Very strange. Then another sip and it did taste funny and still salty. I threw away. On my way back and went to the store to let them know about it and the only answer that I got was “thank for let us know”. I didn’t even get an offer for another one or a refund. So this will be my last time visiting this store for sure.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters, located on Union Street in San Francisco, was supposed to be a fantastic coffee shop - people told me they had the best coffee, believe me. But when I visited six months ago, it was a total disaster, folks, a complete mess.  First of all, they ran out of pastries way too early, just sad. I mean, who does that? You're supposed to be a top-notch coffee place, and you can't even keep enough pastries stocked? A good business knows how to satisfy its customers, and let me tell you, folks, I know good businesses. I've built many great businesses, some of the best in the world.  To make matters worse, they gave my latte to another customer. Can you believe it? I ordered this fantastic latte, I was excited, and they just gave it away! It's like they don't even care about their customers. If I were running the place, that would never happen. I know how to treat people right.  And let's talk about the service. It was slow and unfriendly, just terrible. I've had some of the best service in the world at my hotels and resorts, and this place doesn't even come close. The staff seemed like they didn't want to be there, and it made the whole experience very unpleasant. If you want a successful coffee shop, you've got to have great service, and Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters just doesn't cut it.  In conclusion, folks, I can't recommend this place. With the lack of pastries, the mix-up with my latte, and the terrible service, it was a huge disappointment. There are so many other fantastic coffee shops in San Francisco, and this one just doesn't measure up. I've always said, you've got to be the best, and Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters is definitely not the best."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,No mask no service No wait  Cashless payment but not contactless.  Coffee was very dark and smooth with a tad acidity but I found it just right. The staff work masks and were nice.  I would visit again if I was around the neighborhood.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"From the moment I stepped inside, I was overcome with the feeling that this place was attempting to put on a show.  I got the impression that the staff felt like it was their job to teach me. Just what I never quite got. Odd because I travel more than most and visit countless coffee shops and never got that feeling before. Still, the Coffee was good."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Good specialty coffee. It’s a cute place with friendly staff but a bit pricey. We paid 11$ for an oat cappuccino and cortado.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Small and cute location. The coffee tasted great but the prices are quite high.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Delicious coffee. Unwelcoming staff on our visit. And drink orders came up with minimal guidance and ended up with people taking wrong ones.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"It was disappointing.  From the photos, you believe you're going to have a good coffee, but the reality is that the barista doesn't know what he's doing.  I ordered a cappuccino that was so hot that the coffee tastes burnt, I can't hold the cup for more than a few minutes and I burned my tongue trying to drink the coffee.  Another point was arriving around 10am and not having food options."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"A hole-in-the-wall venue reminds me of a Cuckoo clock - a bird juts out to ask for your order ;  Long lines move  briskly ;  outdoors, two small steel tables and chair pose for a still life painting. I read my newspaper realizing that folks may want my seat.  But I was inadvertently enjoying my eavesdropping on a loud couple on their first date. I guess the couple  are incompatible but the Excellent Cappuccino is thick and frothy.  Hip cafe but not a neighborhood cafe, it’s more a drive-by cafe ; doesn’t belong to the community  in a meaningful manner. It’s a missed opportunity for them which can be fixed by adding more tables and chairs. But they won’t . And so it goes …."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Great coffee! Amazing cookies:)
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"The best espresso drinks on Union Street. I recommend their large latte, it comes with 4 shots by default. Usually they run out of pastries very quickly. Line depends on the day, busiest days is Sat and Sun. But definitely worth waiting for. Also their coffee beans are really great and regarding pastries they have a collaboration with local Bakery La Moreis( highly recommend, these guys are the best , too)"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Espresso is smooth, flavorful, and not bitter. They use califia oat milk which I prefer over oatly."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Very nice place and good service , the coffee was one of the best I had recently - Latte . Thank you"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"My friend’s favorite spot for pour over! And her pour over was truly great.  My flat white appeared to be cappuccino and I can’t say I liked it. It was ok, I’d say 6/10.  The staff is very nice and friendly tho, and the place itself is a tiny peaceful heaven."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I'm posting before AND after pictures, because you just have to know how Flaky this croissant is. Oh my! RUN. don't Walk to Wrecking Ball!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Great little Boutique roaster. Very cool shop with Marla Bakery pastries and friendly and extremely competent people. My go to shop in the neighborhood for high-end coffee and excellent cappuccino.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Lack of effort in the Cortado, not a great vibe to sit down, and poor customer service. Not worth the time to come here"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Tiny store with amazing coffee.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Cool vibes & cortado; get it in glass and take a minute… delicious
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"My iced latte tasted like watery milk. I thought maybe it was bc they only did a single shot (?), so I went back up and asked if I could add a second shot. They confirmed it already had 2 shots in it and charged me $3.50 for adding the extra shot. So I paid over $8 for a latte that *still* didn't have the body, creaminess, or quality you'd expect. There are so many other great places in SF, so prob best to skip this one."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Great tasting brewed coffee & espresso drinks. Friendly service.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Really good place with awesome people behind the bar, had a drip coffee and it was really good, haven't tried anything else."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,One of the most careful and perfect pour-over coffee spots in SFO.  Beauty and ambiance but unfortunately less than 5 seats and a bench. I still give 5 stars for the awesome coffee and service.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Long-time customer. I’ve been going to wrecking ball since their opening when I lived only a few blocks away. It was my morning coffee spot. Now every time I visit SF I HAVE to go before leaving. The staff is SO friendly! I order the ICED CAPPUCCINO. It’s a layer of cold then a layer of hot. It’s refreshing but tolerable even on a cold day. Great for any weather. I’ve ordered lattes and other coffee drinks as well and they are all great!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I try not to leave reviews unless the place either wows me or completely disappoints. For starters, if you’re looking for any type of flavoring or sweeteners other than simple syrup or honey, this is not your place. They don’t even have cinnamon to top off a cappuccino. When I went to order, the two girls were too busy having a conversation to even realize I was standing there. Finally when one of the girls came over, she seemed annoyed that I was ordering and immediately after I ordered, told me to put my card in and continued her conversation. The coffee was super bitter and overly acidic. The lid didn’t fit on the cup either but I didn’t have the chance to ask the woman for another lid because of how quickly she left the front to continue her conversation. I was hoping to have a good experience at a cute coffee shop before I left San Francisco but I was extremely disappointed and felt like I wasted my money"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Hi Bridgette,  I'd like to thank you for taking the time to leave valuable feedback, and we apologize for the experience you had our cafe. We set a high standard for ourselves and we're sorry to hear this was not met in your interaction with our business. We'll strive to do better in the future."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Very special setup: Pour-over station and sugar plate. Nice flavorful cappuccino too. Good job, SF!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Nice small hipster coffee shop in Cow Hollow, offering also some good pastry from a local bakery."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Pricey but very chic and taste amazing!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Nick cho faced 40 years in prison for tax fraud look it up! Washington post. They steal from customers
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Unrelated to events you mention of more than a decade ago, Nick Cho is no longer working with Wrecking Ball Coffee.  Wrecking Ball  exchanges coffee for money. There is no cheating here. "
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,1 star sustainability 5 star coffee  Went to Wrecking Ball today (April 7th) with my reusable cup and they said they would not fill it up. This is their current policy - only single use cups. Starbucks (Union or Presidio) has been accepting reusable cups for months. At some stores they'll just put your cup into a mug if the staff won't handle it by hand. Can you change your policy or put this on your storefront stating you won't take reusable cups. I'll be pausing my visits until you change this policy.  Coffee is great and it's 5 stars. I'll happily update my review to reflect just the coffee as soon as reusable cups are allowed again. Please let me know...
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"In-field service that is second to none! I thanked you for making me a really tasty coffee cappuccino. This coffee flavor is my absolute favorite, and I'm so pleased you all share my taste. I like returning to your coffee flavor again and again. What a wonderful service, boys! A downtown coffee shop that comes highly recommended! Thank you very much, boys!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Good coffee spot with tasty coffee. Parking a bit hard to find if you are driving.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffees that are carefully prepared. Small inside seating area with a few tables outside to enjoy the day.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Delicious coffee from a small local business, although not cheap.  It is a nice treat and we should all help our local businesses as much as possible."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Staff is so friendly. I love their oat milk cap. I was a little sad to find out they’re only doing to-go because their indoor space - albeit, also small - used to be a great venue to relax on weekend mornings."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I can't express enough gratitude towards what the staff at this coffee shop provided to me this morning. I had to make an early order 10 minutes before the opening time, and came back to get it later during the shelter in place, which I had to work early and alone in the morning.  The Mocha I received not only tasted great with perfect temp (even though I ordered it 25 minutes ahead), it also warmed my heart  that the staff understood my time constraint. It was the act of kindness to start the day with and as a result I had a great day throughout.  Definitely will be loyal customer whenever I'm in the area."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"This welcoming coffee shop is just a block away. The atmosphere is friendlier and more student-centered at school. I'll refer to it as the nearby Starbucks because it offers more elegant breakfast, lunch, and dinner dining options. With a small band of patio chairs, the interior is cramped but well-designed. I'll definitely return!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"My drink was really good, but the place was a little bit dirty..."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Nice little street cafe.  I want to try the cookie but they are out of it.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"This review made our day, thank you so much for stopping by. Hopefully you get that cookie!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Amazing coffee and amazing services
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Delicious coffee and very friendly staffs! Only down side is that there are not many seats.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,This is a tiny little coffee place with only takeout options. There is no seating there. We went around 2pm so there were no food options which is understandable since they open at 7am. The cappuccino was great and the wait time was not bad. Surprisingly we got parking quickly as well
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Went here two days in a row, first got the espresso, then a pour over. The espresso was quite good, nuttier than most craft espresso with solid balance. Then the pour over was amazing. I got the Ethiopia and this is a wonderful coffee perfectly dialed in. Every variable is honed to bring out the best in this coffee. Delicious sweetened pineapple notes and a well developed roast. The service here is also great, they're very friendly and engaging. Just know that this isn't a place to take a date or to do work, there are only a few seats and it's designed to get you in and out fairly quickly."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Awesome coffee ! Beans freshly grounded, delicious. Friendly staff."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Literally the best coffee and pastry in San Francisco - lived in the city for a year and have been buying morning coffee every single morning (lol - almost!) I vote Wrecking Ball for #001 comparing to various blue-chip names around me, Blue Bottle, Golden Goat, name it!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Great hole in the wall coffee shop. Limited seating. They do not have cold brew, but they do have a wonderful iced coffee that’s just as strong. Great personalities behind the counter. Great, strong coffee - that’s not bitter. 5 star coffee flavor - 4 star bc they don’t have cold brew :/"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I visited while exploring SF by myself and LOVED this place. I ordered a delicious iced latte and while I waited, there was a homey, neighborhood feel to the place. The staff interacted with people who seemed to be regulars sitting at a bar, and I still felt very welcomed. One of the best coffee spots I've been to!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee and a great service! Bought a chocolate cookie there, the cookie was small so the cashier gave me another one for free."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Slightly inconsistent with espresso pulls and request for “light ice” often missed (see photo).
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Best mocha in town. They use a chocolate ganache instead of powder or syrup. All mocha should be made this way, but unfortunately  this is the only place I know where they have this style. Very rich and cacao buttery chocolate  experience,  but not very sweet. Just the way I like it ;)"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"One of SF's very best! How good can good coffee get? THIS GOOD! Small and limited seating as others have said. I visited twice in as many days, stellar espresso each visit in spite of what appeared to be a couple of dis-interested employees."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Looked up a great coffee shop before heading across the bridge and found this gem! Definitely great coffee (mocha with soy and cappuccino) Mocha was a sweet chocolate drink, but not an overpowering mocha flavor. Just right with a smooth finish. The employees were spectacular with our two boys in letting them stamp the cups! Got to say so glad we stopped by!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Amazing coffee! Highly recommend to anyone in search of great coffee.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Arrived right when they opened. Friendly and efficient staff. The barista was really good. I had a mocha and a match latte. Both were made really well.  Not much seating seemed like more of a to go type place but very clean inside. They have almond milk as an option. Didn't ask about any other options. While I was drinking my mochana steady stream of customers but never got packed.  Will definitely be back when visiting the area.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Meh. Coffee was stale, customer service is lacking  There are much better roasters in the city like Hedge or even better coffee shops on Union Street like the coffee roastery just a block away.  The appearance of the shop may be what’s causing the better reviews here, but unfortunately they’re not letting guests inside despite the lifting of covid restrictions."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"We were there on Thanksgiving Day and actually returned later in the day for another coffee...and went again later on in our trip. It had a great community vibe. We had a latte and a mocha- both delicious. Coffee is prepared hot but not too hot to drink which my husband really appreciated. Wallpaper is super cute, of course. Baristas also had solid recommendations for things to do in the area. We will definitely return if we’re back in the Bay Area. A real winner!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Solid barista technique but I think there’s room for improvement in the coffee selection and roasting process. I tried two bags of coffee and both had slightly inconsistent and too dark roasting and rather forgettable flavor.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Joshua, thanks for the feedback. We roast meduim and always have. It's a style, but maybe not everyone's taste. Hope you give us anther try someday. -Trish"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Their espresso is full-bodied and balanced, staff is very friendly, and for non-dairy drinkers, you have a choice of soy/almond/oat milks. I love the wallpaper too. One of my favorite places to get a cup of coffee in SF!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Some pretty bad coffee. Hot or cold it was crazy burnt. Matcha with no sugar added. Espresso was even burnt. Stay away
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Perfect hipster coffee shop, exactly what I was looking for in this neighborhood. Simple coffee menu but great attention to detail. The pastries looked great, too, and I favored the cardamom coffee cake, which complemented the cortado perfectly. A small quiet space to enjoy your espresso."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"The single use compostable cups here are terrible. Unlike other cafes in the area they refuse to fill a byo cup or offer another option but single use cups.  Just to get a coffee it isn’t worth going here if you need one and care about the planet. They just don’t care and staff are rude.  Head to the French cafe on chestnut if you are desperate for their coffee, as at least they will serve in a byo (they have dont this through covid with no issues) and have mugs"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I don't know what the hype is about this coffee shop but it's really nothing much. Specially for San Francisco, which is a haven for amazing coffee houses, this place is definitely not worth visiting just out of the fact that it's listed on the places to go. To me it looks like a neighborhood fav because it's the only third wave coffee around. Never seen a service so slow with a handful of people around. They didn't even have a Macchiato listed on the menu and the coffee beans are expensive compared to the ones sold by third wave coffee shops. Perfect example of social media hype and nothing much."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Small hipstery coffee shop with a pretentious vibe. Counters and glass cabinets don’t look super clean, and neither does the space behind the counter. A 12oz latte costs $5.30 (lol). Gets pretty loud inside very quickly if there’s more than a few people. There were four people behind the counter who were mostly busy laughing it up with each other; the cashier didn’t spell my name right and one of the other indistinguishable hipster staff didn’t even try to pronounce it correctly.  The coffee though is... not bad? It’s better than Starbucks (and there is of course a La Marzocco machine here, apparently a hallmark of “premium” coffee in SF) but there are literally dozens of better, cleaner coffee shops with better service within walking distance. Why you’d want to come here specifically I have no idea; I wouldn’t suggest it."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Good coffee and pastries. Pretty fast but there is usually a line (because it’s good)
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"It looked like a spot with high-quality coffee but actually not… the ice latte I got tasted burnt, just average or even below average considering the price"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I am sorry to hear your drink wasn’t up to standard. We will look into this issue you shared with us here.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"This place came highly recommended, and I was excited to hear that a high end coffee place had set up shop in this neighborhood. My first visit was ok only - fair latte, but nothing to write home about. I decided to try a second time in case the first experience had been an outlier, but was further disappointed. The latte ($4.5) foam was not at its optimum and the pain au chocolat (also $4.5) was pretty average. Service was also not particularly friendly on either occasion. So while the place looks and is priced exactly like a high end, Blue Bottle type of coffee place, I was disappointed the output failed to live up to expectations. The place itself is very small, so mostly a take out location (although they have a few small tables outside where you can sit)."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"We're sorry to hear that you didn't have a 5-star experience, and would love to understand better how we didn't live up to your expectations so we can do better next time. If you're interested in giving us feedback, please do at: shop@wreckingballcoffee.com. Thanks -Nick"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Simple hole in the wall coffee shop that has my favorite coffee in the neighborhood. With no shortage of coffee places in Cow Hollow / Marina, Wrecking Ball is the perfect stop to grab a coffee, quick chat with the super friendly baristas (usually about whatever music they have playing - great taste in music), and then be on your way. Love this place."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Not very good coffee. The heart is pretty tho.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Wasn’t even acknowledged by the baristas for almost ten minutes. They were slammed, but it’s a tiny shop. Someone should’ve at least said “hello” and let me know that they’d be with me in a moment. As a barista myself, I know what’s it’s like to have ten drinks to make and more orders to take, but I also know how far it goes to just let the customers know that you see them. The coffee was good."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I love how they make a pour over here, very balanced and delicate to my taste. Goes great with a savory scone"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I had a great cap and iced coffee here.  Also their whole beans are probably the best.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Great cappuccino and vibe. Coffee quality is excellent.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Awesome place, minimal and high quality coffee. My choice was cortado which is rarely can be make in proper way.  Love guys who are much better educated how to treat people amongst others places in SF. No poker faces:) 💋"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I have a coffee subscription here and love the Ethiopia Classic Yirgacheffe. I was in town and visited the store and was impressed by how fast the service was. Even though it's a tiny shop and the line was out the door I had my coffee in a few minutes.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Friendly staff. Great pour over bar where you can sit and watch the love be poured into your coffee. They also use straus milk for their espresso drinks. Not a great place to hang out though as there aren’t any tables or all that much seating.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"The drip coffee was flavorless and they added too much half and half. Worse, they gave us four disposable cups for two coffees that we immediately put into reusable cups."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,The hot chocolate is the best thing I’ve ever tasted. Super rich and creamy and sweet!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Awesome coffee. Espresso was dialed in and smooth. Got a bag of the Guatemala Huehuetenango which has been tasting great on aeropress. Baristas were super friendly and knowledgeable as well!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Not serving pour over because it takes too long with only 2 employees and long lines…except there wasn’t a line. Great coffee you just have to make it yourself. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I don’t get how this place has great reviews. Got a latte and it was straight milk. Asked for additional shot of espresso, paid almost $4 on top of the $6 for the latte and was served not even a spit worth of espresso. I’d never go back"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Cute little coffee shop! Coffee was great and the staff was very friendly. They have a long bench for seating that runs along the side of the shop, accented by this pineapple wallpaper, and have a couple tables outside as well."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Disappointing that this cafe doesn’t accept byo reusable cups & they only serve in single use.  Even Starbucks down the street takes reusable cups. Sad I couldn’t try this cafe but they don’t give care about the environment.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"We travel often and visit many coffee shops while doimg so. This is the best coffee we have had by a landslide. Everything is crafted so carefully, and it shows. It was incredibly fresh and perfectly blended."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,So one of the main reasons I wanted to check this place out is because I saw a post by my favorite blogger that was shot here. The coffee was good but nothing overly special. Honestly the coolest part about this place was the science behind the pour over and the pineapple wallpaper!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Delicious mocha on the pricier side($6), but it is the marina. Nice area to walk with a take-out coffee"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Stopped in here to try the hot chocolate. I had heard they use TCHO so I was pretty excited to see what their drink is like. TCHO did not disappoint. My first sip was stunningly delightful, a very rich and delicious drink. I was a little bummed that they don't do the hot coco with almond milk because it is pre-made with dairy. The extreme creaminess, while amazing at first, got to be a little too much by my last sip.  I was glad it came in an 8oz rather than 12. As for atmosphere: the staff was friendly and informative, the space is small, welcoming, and quiet so plenty of space to sit."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Cute coffee spot. Seems like they definitely take coffee seriously and the folks in there seemed like coffee aficionados. Loved their pineapple wallpaper. Loved that they let us come in with our pups even more!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Best coffee I've had in San Francisco!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Good place for coffee and first thing in the morning, the croissants are still warm."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I spent a week in SF, ate out for every meal. I must have walked the whole peninsula! I received poor service and even worse coffee. It was clear that the barista wasn't happy working there as it showed with how she acted. Instagram fame only gets you so far."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Excellent coffee and pastries. Quick, efficient, and friendly staff. Some sidewalk seating."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Thank you! So glad you enjoyed your visit.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"High quality delicious coffee (ordered a cortado and cuppacino). Service was friendly, quick and safe. Even stopped to give my dog a treat!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,These guys know their stuff. They have a great La Marzocco machine and now how to make a pretty amazing espresso. Best yet they can do a proper flat white - one that would make a kiwi proud
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"The staff are friendly and the place has a positive (and dog friendly!) atmosphere.  The espresso is quality, and the only downside is the lack of face to face seating and tables."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Small hidden coffee shop that makes great pour over using the Kalita Wave. Also bring in fresh pastries from Marla Bakery. Not a whole lot of space to sit inside, but there are two small outdoor tables with a view of Union St."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Trish and Nick are at the forefront of San Francisco coffee. Where they lead, others follow. All of their coffee is consistently great, and they have a lack of searching out beans with flavor profiles that few have seen before. The baristas here are on point with their espresso, but if you want the heavens to open up and the angels to sing, take the time for a pour over."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Petite coffee amazingly located for a quick shot during the day
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"It looked like they were short on staff. There was a huge line of people waiting for their drinks to be made. I waited 25 minutes for my drink. Coffee is good, but I can find many other places in the city with better coffee"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Real chic interior with the all white decor. Staff is friendly and the coffee here is quite good. There is a counter top for seating but more of a take away place
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Small to-go place. Expect some lines. Nice service. Overpriced. No pastries. Soft boiled eggs for $2.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Amazing coffee & pastries, the people who work here are pretty awesome too. A definite staple in the Marina did I also mention the owners stand up for what is right in this world! 🙌❤️ …"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Seriously obsessed with this neighborhood coffee spot. Great cappuccinos and great service. The wallpaper is adorable too! Highly recommend for locals and those visiting.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Great cappuccino until I was almost at the end and took a sip and a chunky something came out, making me gag and spit take into the grass. No idea what it was but pretty off putting."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"We're so sorry that happened, Jasmin! If you want to email contact@wreckingballcoffee.com, we can get you set up with a drink on us next time."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I spend a lot of time in NYC, Chicago and SFO for work.  I make it point to seek out artisan coffee shops wherever I go.  Wrecking ball is hands down the best I've had anywhere.  There are wonderful offerings, of course, in NYC (Birch, La Colombe), in Chicago (Bow Truss), and in SFO (Jane, SOMA Eats), but Wrecking Ball is a cut above in terms of espresso quality.  I am a macchiato junky, and there is none better than the chocolatey goodness that is WB espresso.  I'll be back this week and am looking forward to it."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Quick service. Few tables outside. More of a place to get your coffee to go. Best coffee I had in Cow Hollow in the few days I was in the area visiting.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Small shop with a lot of character. The owners put a lot of effort into the decor and it really shows. Great place to stop by and grab a drink but not really a place to stay and do work due to a lack of tables.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I have been there at least 3 times and they are consistent with great coffee, bagels and fast service.Good food and coffee shop. Price are very reasonable and very clean."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I love this place. Best capuccino around the Presidio.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I really like the coffee and the staff is friendly and all...but guys, you bathroom is SO GROSS! I have never seen the toilet bowl being clean, and I have been at your locations several times, in the morning, during the day, or around closing time, it's always the same....not cool!!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Our favorite neighborhood coffee spot.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Fantastic coffee quality, laid-back atmosphere, but quite expensive. I visit Wrecking Ball every time I’m in SF (live in LA), and I’m always pleased with the service and the drinks."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"They didn’t have pour over. But their batch brew is quite amazing, super fruity!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this awesome review
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Awesome coffee shop in San Francisco. Service was friendly and quick!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,We are so grateful for your kind words. Thanks for sharing your review with us and the community.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Had the mocha. Tbh it's expensive but also one of the best mocha I've ever had. My friend agrees with me.  Worth the visit.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,High quality coffee but the staff are very unfriendly.  First 4-5 times I thought perhaps they were having a bad day but that seems to be the norm; it's like they hate their jobs.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Love their coffee. It's a very artisan cafe with tasty pastries. Highly recommended.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I am fiest time to visit this cafe. The design is very trendy and people are very nice. I ordered a cafe mocha. The taste is disappointed. I don't know it is chocolate milk or espresso coffee...
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, nice staff, many options to substitute milk, and delicious baked goods. Only down side is space as there is no tables inside due to the layout of the shop."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,It's a little hole in the wall coffee place with awesome pastries and great coffee. Just what we wanted on our way out of SF. Thanks!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,This is one of the best coffee’s I have found in San Francisco. This is a small but very busy cafe. Best of all the are open late in the afternoon. I’ll be back
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Coffee is good no doubt but really loved their croissant collection. I tried the butter croissant and the pain au chocolat
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Our go to coffee shop and the best in San Francisco! A little underground coffee shop with very friendly staff who care about your coffee, and you! Definitely worth a visit for coffee lovers."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Why is this place closed at 1 p.m. on a Sunday? Emblematic of post-Covid SF’s decrepit dysfunction.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Best coffee place around! Super smooth coffee. Lovely staff. Also great teas from Kilogram!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,The staff is so friendly(especially for a coffee shop) and the coffee is always amazing. This is by far my favorite coffee shop in the bay and there are plenty of coffee shops to choose from.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Unfriendly staff, so-so coffee, and not environmentally friendly (no reusable cups allowed).  Won’t be returning."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I've tried Cappuccinos on both coasts and this place has the best! Wonderful people who understand coffee making to a science. Only place I regularly go to now.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"For their ""radically inclusive"" missions statement, I feel like Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters did a fine job at pricing me out. Charging what they do for watery coffee is ridiculous."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Coffee was just okay. Beans didn’t taste too fresh. The Mill is a much better option.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Styled as though Apple made a coffee bar: sleek, white. Really good cortados. Owners are worth supporting!"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,One of the best high end coffee shops in all of SF. Just wish they had a parklet outside since there is limited seating inside.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Best matcha in the district!! The staff are very nice and one of the baristas with the Pink Hair is extremely helpful!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Unfortunately the quality and speed of service has detiorated at this quaint local coffee shop. Would love to see the quality and taste of coffee return to it's former Wrecking glory.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. The pour over is well worth the wait. Beans are pretty expensive though. Definitely worth the visit.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"I personally didn’t like the coffee, it was too strong for me and not smooth ( ordered latte). Also pricy for what it is"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Amazing roasters. Took the coffee back home and enjoyed every bit. I highly recommend the natural Ethiopian.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Tiny, tidy space. Big caffeine. Crafted coffee. Wrecking Ball definitely is one of the reasons SF is known for having great coffee."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Nice people the baristas aren't two sprockets your usual array of high-end pastry type goodies and teas, and a lot of RBF from the patrons."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Specialty coffee! Pourover Kenya and Ethiopia are both super sweet and with hogh quality acidity. Baristas are also very professional!
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Absolutely amazing coffee which would totally be a five star rating....sadly the ambiance was ruined by really intrusive punk music - will absolutely come back tho but may get it to go :)
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Quaint hole in the wall coffee shop, delicious coffee. Staff are lovely."
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,A small neighborhood focus sprockets style Cafe. Precious pastries and pour over coffee and the usual accompaniment of not milk lattes and cappuccinos.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,Nice latte & friendly barista but the cafe is really echoey so can be a little noisy even when there aren't many people there
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Luke warm cortado, weak espresso. Had to throw it out and go to St Franks"
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,I am sorry to hear about your negative experience. We take pride in our drink making and we apologize your cortado wasn’t up to standard.
Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters,"Very decent coffee even in the middle of pandemic.  Beware of line, only one person making coffee there."
