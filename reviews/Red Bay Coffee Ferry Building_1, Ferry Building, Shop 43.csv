Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Really good coffee, although a little pricey. Located in the Ferry Building was super convenient.  Used the tablet to order. A 12oz mocha latte was about $7. Service was great and good vibe in the cafe."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Ordering kiosks a convenient addition. We had a decaf mocha and a Saigon latte. Both tasty. Unfortunately no low-fat milk. Choices were whole milk, half and half, almond, or oat milk."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Like this spot for their yummy bakery! Their seasonal croissants make people come early! As for coffee, I’d say it’s on the same level as the Blue bottle. But if I’m lucky enough to catch croissants I’m ordering coffee here as well. They have no sitting inside but there are some nice spots in the ferry terminal or outside on the market plaza where you can seat and enjoy your treat."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Vegan / Veg / Vegetarian review:  Tried their oatmilk mocha based on the barista’s recommendation. It was all right, low on calories but not the tastiest! Worth trying if you’re vegan and want something on the go.  I really wish they had vegan croissants though 👀"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Coffee shop in market place and. Ferries mall! Quite professional and very nice coffee! Great to sip a perfect expresso after eating 3 dozens of oysters from their neighbor hog island oysters co! Highly recommended
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,I love coffee and so I always appreciate a good kind. It’s also nice to be hanging out here just vibrantly amusing watching people come and go while enjoying a really good coffee :)
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Pleasant ambiance with a great view of the water from the seating. Amazing place to cowork as there's plenty of comfortable chairs and desk space to accommodate. I got a hot tea which was very well priced ($3.15) and I had a variety of delicious options to choose from. A great reprieve from the bustling market street experience, before I make my way back out into the world."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,It is so much fun to grab a coffee and drink it in a 130 years old ferry building and watching ferries come and go
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I like the vibe and minimal design with nice chairs. There are some really cute merchandise to buy. Always a line to get your coffee. I got charcoal latte and asked for half sweetener but it was way sweet and I didn’t like it. And got a black tea it was ok like other tea bag one!  But i went there for work it had wifi and nice chair to sit for a ling time. I haven’t try their coffee and will go again for work because of it’s location, ferry building and nice vibe! Charcoal latte will get 2 stars for me!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Conveniently located in the ferry building. Has a variety of hot and cold beverages as well as a few snacks and coffee accessories. Unfortunately, give it lower stars because they charge extra for plant-based milk which these days, should be less than if not equal to more environmentally destructive animal milk.  They have coffee as well as tea, such as matcha. They also sell one fine + raw chocolate item which is nice to see you. Would be great to see more vegan items, including in the pastry case."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"One of the best coffee drinks I've had in SF so far. I found myself just sitting down and enjoying my cup because it had such a pleasant taste. It had a strong and smooth flavor that was easy to drink. Plus they made ordering so convenient for their customers. You can either line up, order at their kiosk, or order online so you can just pick it up when you get there. I found myself coming back to this place every chance I got."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Bad day for coffee. We came across town to try out the coffee shop. We were excited about the menu. I placed the order latte, coffee and Tumeric tea latte.  Paid and gave them my name. Gave 25% tip. And we waited...waited and waited. We saw folks behind us getting served. We told the folks behind the counter and told them about our order. No one was now in the coffee shop. The young lady said, "" Well let's checked if you paid."" In a sarcastic way. The cashier confirmed I paid. They made it and not a simple sorry. This is what is wrong with some folks. Sorry will go a long way. So with that your place gets no star for service. And I have a lots of friends that love coffee. No more Red Bay coffee!!!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Coffee is a medium or a dark roast, a little bit too strong for me at first, but after a few sips roasteness kind of grew on me. It was a good late. Coffee shop itself is very nice and clean, very close to the ocean too. Staff is nice."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Good location and nice space, but the Red Bay Spritzer was not for me - tasted like Coca Cola mixed in with espresso."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I’ve loved Red Bay for a while and I’m so glad they opened this lovely location in the Ferry Building. I come by every other week or so for coffee beans, mostly because buying a bag comes with a free drip (which is really high quality compared to batch brews at other cafes).  There is often a line, but the baristas move quickly and I’ve never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for an espresso based drink. Other pros — lots of high quality gifts & local brands, view of the water, kind staff, and unlike blue bottle they’re not owned by Nestle :) My only complaint is that customers often don’t understand how lines work - it’s marked clearly on the floor!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"This used to be my go-to in the Ferry Building, but not anymore. TLDR; They got my name and order wrong and asked if the incorrect drink was ok, but it would've caused an allergic reaction for my colleague.  I ordered this morning with the girl behind the counter for a matcha latte with oat milk for me and my colleague. She asked me for my name, and I thought I was good. I timed it perfectly so we have more than enough time for her to get to the office.  Tell me why they got my name and order wrong. Two matcha lattes with almond milk for Fernando. My name is Andrew. I was waiting, and they kept calling for this guy, so after a while I concluded it was for me. When I told the guy behind the counter that I asked for oat, not almond milk, he said it was almond milk and if that's fine. It was not.  My colleague is literally allergic to nuts and would have a severe reaction if she drank that. They made us new drinks, but we were now running late and I will never come here again."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Open space, bay view cafe with lots of variety of coffee, espresso drinks. Such as Red Bay fog, tumeric latte, charcoal latte, seasonal candied yam latte, etc. Love the compostable coffee lids.  Merchandise they sell are somewhat pricey, but it is SF prime location. Get here early as the line can be long after 9:30am."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,The pickup area is a disaster.  Sage tea was okay. The charcoal latte was okay.  Priced just right  Relocate the tablet to order away from the door. People just stand there to order and it blocks the incoming/outgoing traffic.  Relocate the tablet to order from the register (by the time you see it you are already at the register) move it to a different area.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Just found out this spot is Black-owned. After visiting a few times in the past few months, I’m quite surprised. The only thing that may have eluded to anything Black was a seemingly pro-Black garment for sale. Now I must return with new eyes.  I found the service to be unfriendly and mediocre. My drink cup was a hot mess, literally. Ordering is a bit confusing and patrons are a bit rude. I left before ordering at least twice."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Surprisingly good coffee and excellent alternative to evil Nestles blue bottle.  Coffee is light roasted and delicious; Tom of drink variations, including rarely found Cafe Au Lait.  Enjoy"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Absolutely delicious espresso drinks. The iced latte is amazing with or without sweetener- my favorite is the honey lavender though! Also the cappuccino and the macchiato were both delicious too. Decor is crisp and full of plants and neutrals to give a really nice vibe! Also the concept behind the coffee- Africa's gift to the people is beautiful and complimented by their selection of small black owned business items from scarves to mugs for purchase.  I highly recommend! Plus the baristas are kind and complete the perfect San Francisco coffee shop experience you hope for.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Nice staff, but best not to go when too busy. They lost our order so coffee took almost an hour. However, the chai lattes were perfect."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,The cold brew coffee was full of flavour not much GF. But if you go to Mariposa just 10 meters away your all good.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I love that they have Neighbor Bakehouse baked goods. Love their unique twists  such as the charcoal, candied yam lattes!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Funky coffee shop in The Market in Downton San Fran. They have a wide variety of coffee options and everything is really tasty,!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"It's wonderful to enjoy coffee that supports a mission and a world objective. The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, as a tourist to the marketplace in San Francisco this quenched my need for quality coffee. Highly recommend going in and trying their cold brew, it is outstanding."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"10-22-21: Ordered a small drip coffee and got an 8 Oz coffee for $2.25.  It was good. Unfortunately, they add milk or cream for you so and the server put too much milk for my taste. So the coffee was a bit too watered down for me.  I wish they would ask you how much cream you wanted. Oh well. Next time I would try blue bottle coffee around the corner."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Very convenient spot for coffee in the ferry building. The space is very clean and service is decently quick with how busy it was. I ordered the Vietnamese cold brew and it was delicious, perfectly sweet. Would recommend."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Told me after I bought it that they didn’t have the $6 drink I ordered. Then got me another drink that had a very sweet and weird aftertaste. I wish that they had told me before I paid that they didn’t have the drink I ordered. Waste of money
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,‘Iced latte with half fat milk’… was one of the best coffees I’ve had in 27 years.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Very disappointed. First and last time I get a coffee here. Ordered a cappuccino and au lait, both were bad quality overpriced and took long. Service was impersonal. Such a beautiful location deserves a better cafe."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Convenient spot for a good coffee, open much later than other shops in the area."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,The guy with dip dreads is rude and condescending. He asked me for an ID to pick up my coffee. He worked there 5/20/23 @ 12:20pm. They don't offer straws either.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"This place was the highlight of my San Francisco vacation! The candied yam latte was amazing! I loved the ordering system and my coffee arrived quickly even when the place was busy. If you all ever think of branching out, might I suggest Huntsville as an option."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Love this new place in the ferry building. Coffee is great. They also sell vegan chocolate and neighbor backhouse's pastries.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,a smaller toastd honey lemon drip makes a nice sweet sip by the typical whole sugar packet
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Nice ambiance, coffee shop in the San Francisco Ferry Building"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Got a quick coffee here on our way to the Alcatraz tour. It was the only coffee shop open early enough on a Sunday which I thought was odd. The guy who took my order seemed to have forgotten what I ordered which was the only hiccup for me. I got a mocha and it wasn’t anything crazy, it was rich & hot which is what I like in a coffee 😂"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I wish the barista didn’t throw away the wrong coffee order. It’s wasteful!!  I ordered an iced latte through its machine. Then I was given a warm latte, so I pointed out that I ordered the iced one. She admitted it’s her fault, and threw the whole coffee in the sink and made me an iced latte. I wish she could bother asking if I’d like to keep the warm latte anyway instead of throwing away. I don’t know it’s their policy or what, but wasting is not cool."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Very tasty nut croissant and the cappuccino was smooth. Could do with a bit more seating.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"The shop has excellent coffee, and the view from the outdoor seating is fabulous."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,The matcha latte was great! I love the decor inside. I went at a peak time and they still got my order out very quickly. The staff are also very chipper and friendly! I highly recommend this place
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I really enjoyed my Red Bay Coffee experience. The customer service was exceptional, despite a steady stream of customers. I had the Red Bay Fog (a twist on London Fog) and it was exceptional. My bf had a latte and it delicious. Don't miss out on the pastries either. We split. Pistachio Berry Croissant and it was so tasty. We will definitely be back. Shout out to the owner on the great design as well. This place has a great vibe!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Charcoal latte, mocha, and Saigon latte were all excellent. Friendly staff, and our drinks were prepared in good time considering how busy this place was."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Relaxing little coffee shop with oat and almond milk alternatives. Beautiful coffee to the people! Expresso Lattes Cold Brew Au Lait Tea Baked Goods and many smiles greet the weary traveler in the Ferry Building location.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Great black owned coffee shop...with great drinks and snacks plus much more...
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Fantastic cookies to grab before walking around the waterfront or taking the ferry back over to the bay.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Negative experience - staff was unpleasant. Coffee is average. Go somewhere else. i don’t think they’ll last.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Great matcha latte! Fast service and sweet employees.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Went to the grand opening and was impressed by the great atmosphere, friendly baristas, and quality coffee. I had gotten their free sample of grounds in the mail and loved them. At this cafe I tried the iced vanilla charcoal latte. It was tasty but a little too sweet for me. I look forward to going back and trying new menu items!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"The coffee is reasonably good, but service seemed very chaotic.  Five staff behind the counter and slow to serve customers and really slow to do the coffee, even something as simple as a simple black.  As I am just passing through I am not likely to return, but with service like that, I wouldn’t be back if I was local."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Too expensive, tables not cleaned, they ask for tip but for a hole in my cappuccino plastic cup the solution has been only put it in another plastic cup and not do it again. If prices are high quality has to be high. There are other places for a breakfast in the ferry building"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"RBC coffee is totally FANTASTIC but Saturday openings SHOULD OPEN @ 7am VS 8am since all the farmers will definitely support local coffee joint VS corporate coffee joint BBC Blue Bottle Coffee. Getting that caffeine jolt before Ferry Plaza Farmers Market opens at 8am. In addition, google still reflects the openings at 7am - might want to correct that. Many thanks :)"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Red Bay Coffee is a great coffee source at the Ferry Building. Tourists and SF natives will enjoy a more local experience rather than the expected corporate coffee offerings normally found. The coffee is smooth and hot. The pastries are fresh and delicious. The space is large with limited seating and merch that line the walls. The staff is friendly and efficient. A little COVID patience is required but you will be rewarded with a fine cup of coffee.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,I love Red Bay I always leave with the satisfaction of great coffee and typically great conversation. Due to everything that is going on in the world they are short staffed at times so please be patient cause they're working hard and want you to get your coffee and tea as much as you want it. Rest assured it's always worth the wait :) P.S. the raspberry scone is my favorite and no matter what coffee you get it doesn't disappoint in flavor 🤗
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Wasn't too fond of my drip coffee. It was watered down. Also need more sweetener options such as Splenda or sweet n low; stevia leaves an aftertaste
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Red Bay Coffee is a little pricey but totally worth it! The coffee is superb and the pastries that we got were excellent! We went at a busy time in the morning so the line was fairly long at the Ferry Building. I highly recommend this local establishment.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Terrible mocha ive ever had. Had to throw it in the trash after taking a sip or two. Even gas stations have better ones. It tasted bitter and sour as if the milk had turned bad or something
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Be warned when ordering for yourself on their kiosks, thinking your order will be ready right away. Your ticket might not print and you’ll wait 10 minutes for your order; you’ll watch customers who ordered after you get their drinks. No one will apologize or offer you a freebie for your inconvenience."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Their coffee wasn’t that good, they had no bottled water available, and the barista was cold and standoffish until after I gave her a 40% tip.  That’s strike three.  Considering the service I got, the tip should’ve been zero.  Plus one star for quick service, but I probably won’t be returning here."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Never been a fan of croissants even after travelling through Italy, Spain and France. I decided in a rush to share the pistachio and raspberry croissants and could not believe how incredible they were--I actually had to write a review. Highly Recommend!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Stay away from the “lavender honey” syrup. A quick way to make your cappuccino taste like a scented candle for only 75 cents! 🤮 …
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Made it out to Red Bay Coffee to attend a Yelp Elite event. It was my first special event, and also the first in-person one Yelp has done since Covid, so didn’t know what to expect. Left leaving with a cool experience and a dope swag bag.  Firstly, that charcoal latte was good, like that first sip was exactly what I needed that I didn’t know I needed good. Secondly, the space is great, from the high ceiling to the views of the Bay, to the table of merch, books, and snacks (some vegan), all the way to the shelves of coffee with their inspired names.  Got super excited when I found out the swag bag had the Coltrane, East Fourteenth, and Slow Burn. Can’t wait to brew some at home. Red Bay is based in Oakland and has made a new home at the Ferry Building. More than a coffee shop, this is a community space and I’m here for it."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,A great Coffee place near to the San Francisco Pier (amazing location and view) with tasty Cappuccino and Flat White. One of the few offering a good coffee in SF.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Ordered a regular latte and a Saigon Latte.  Great service.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Low-key obsessed with their Red Bay Fog because it tastes like fruity cereal milk. The staff is friendly and their space has plenty of indoor seating as well as local goods/merchandise to purchase. Be prepared to stand in line for awhile since they're quite popular in the afternoon!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,This it’s the best coffee in town!!!! My espresso was rich and creamy…. and the staff is always so friendly.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Great matcha, long line but efficient and kind service"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,I tried their charcoal coffee and it was very different but good
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I have never in my life seen a slower coffeehouse team. I stood in line for almost 15 minutes- I watched them make 2 drinks- the barista was busy detailing his station, wiping coffee grinds off of a silver platter, while a long line of people stood waiting. It was like watching sloths run a business."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Beautiful Coffee Shop! Artisanal, direct trade coffee. African-American owned. SF ferry building."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Busy and worth the wait. Introduced to this spot by my cousins Reg(Dad) & Aya (daughter) and we'll be going back there again. Charcoal Latte was amazing...
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Great service and fast. Was nice to have a coffee ready brewed and not pretentious pour over one at a time. Simple and wonderful flavor.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,DELICIOUS. We were recommended the Saigon Latte with whole milk and it is like liquid gold!! The cookies are divine too. We would definitely recommend this place.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Awesome coffee spot! The charcoal latte is very unique and tastes great.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Beautiful cafe, friendly staff, great latte and love supporting black owned business.  Beans available for purchase, looking forward to trying those. 👍🏿👍🏼👍🏽❤️ …"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Super friendly! The iced chai was spicy with a great honey sweetness. Glad to have them in the ferry building.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Simply wonderful coffee and the croissant was out of this world! Wonderfully amazing service. Can’t wait to come back to this adorable coffee house.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Lovely tasting coffee!! Would be great if there were more chairs in the outdoor seating place
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,latte is super good here
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,💯💯💯
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Coffee is delicious, but they seem to never be open, regardless of the hours on Google or Yelp."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Got the charcoal latte. It was lukewarm despite being iced and after drinking it, the charcoal made me vomit two hours later. Do not recommend 🤮 …"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Sadly it's an overpriced Starbucks quality coffee. Try Blue Bottle next door if you are expecting something better.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Unlucky indidnt like the taste of the coffee here. But a place is nice to relax
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Literally the worst espresso I've ever tasted... Sour and weak. Bad beans no question.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Love this spot when in SF. Line gets quite long at times but best espresso drinks and people watching to the max.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Another coffee spot to enjoy at Ferry Terminal
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Had the worst espresso of my life at this cafe, never coming back"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Yummy! Coffee and chai are both delicious. Enjoy local roaster with quality beans!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,One of the few areas to internally sit with a charger and laptop in ferry building. Has dog treats too!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Excellent coffee and pastries. Pricey, but not surprising considering the location and view."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Red Bay serves coffee well, and that, maybe a good place for programmers to hang out in!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Great coffee & view!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Delicious cold brew in a nice space with both indoor and outdoor seating, right by the water in the ferry building"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Great coffee great people 👍🏿 …
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Ok coffee and slow & bad service. Don't get fooled by a long line. They are just too slow.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"A very nice environment and the Matcha Latte iced, was delish!"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Just like their slogan beautiful coffee to the people, I love their Saigon latte☕❤"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Cool coffee place, nice staff, right by the pier."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Friendly and fast service.  Super touristy area, but had high quality even when they could have gotten by with worse."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Good coffee and pastries. Nice location. Would come back again.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Tried the charcoal latte and it was a unique twist for a coffee!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Omg go get the charcoal latte. Do not go anywhere else. Go here. Staff was great.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Dropped in and got the charcoal latte. Loved it!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Best oat latte I've ever had
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Amazing fast and DELICIOUS.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Amazing coffee and great pastries from Neighbor Bakery
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Meh, coffee at inflated prices. What happened to Pete's that used to be here?"
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Nice baristas and great coffee
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Used to be amazing, but less so recently."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,One of the finest coffee establishments in San Francisco
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Flat white was delicious.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Long line and 1 coffee maker. Very long wait.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Best coffee in the town!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Really good coffee!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Saigon latte was delicious
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Pricey
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Nice spot to stop at if you're around the ferry building. Got the charcoal latte and it was pretty good! Nice amount of sweetness.  Will likely come back to try out their coffee!
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,The place is beautiful and has many options. You have to order on a screen before entering and it limits asking about the options. I ordered a charcoal novelty coffee and it was very sweet- it didn't say sweetened in the description. We were served by a novice employee who got a simple latte several times wrong. The cookie was delicious.  Conclusion: it did not meet my expectations. I don't know if I'll be back.
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Kiosk ordering was also possible, so it was convenient! The Candied Yam Latte is their signature, and I liked the unique sweetness and fragrance. The coffee was delicious, and it was a pity that I couldn't buy beans, but they were also sold at the mart."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I ordered cold brew, but it was disappointing that the acidity was strong🥲 I think the price is a bit strong because it's a ferry building."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"Our coffee was not made and the order was stamped just like that. After we pointed this out, the order was still processed in a grumpy tone. However, neither the cappuccino nor the matcha latte had anything to do with the right drink. The milk wasn't frothed and there were lumps all over the matcha latte."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,"I had high expectations because the place is very pretty and the vibe of the place is good. There are a few seats. It looks like a place for coffee connoisseurs, however, the drip coffee I ordered disappointed me. I didn't find it rich, too bitter, as if it had been burned."
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Coffee bitter bad and almost undrinkable. The worst espresso we've had
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Very complete and gormet
Red Bay Coffee Ferry Building,Delicious and serviceable
