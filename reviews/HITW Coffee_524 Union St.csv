HITW Coffee,"I love this little shop. I don’t live too far away and it’s such a cool shop. Got a coffee here while I did laundry. One of the cool things about this place is you can text ahead if you’re busy. All drip coffee, outside seating, nice people. I got the north beach which is a dark roast. If you’re looking for coffee and around I would suggest here for a drip."
HITW Coffee,"TWICE I have come here just to find the place closed when they are advertised being open.  Owner/barista responded once many hours later to inform me they were closed due to a foreseen pre-planned event.  Update your hours! It ain’t hard. I used to manage the Google admin stuff for a company.  Coffee is good, not amazing, but good and right priced for the area.. if you can find them open"
HITW Coffee,"3 things made this my new favorite coffee stop in this peculiar metropolis:  -Neighborhood Staple: Nick knows half (maybe more) the folks walking by and his “Hey [insert name]” made it feel like the Cheers of coffee. It’s refreshing to see someone who loves their job and whose patrons love him right back.  - Banter: Helluva story teller. Telling them is difficult enough; telling them in bite sized format while you’re waiting for him to make your artisan coffee is next level difficulty. And he is a master - A griot of galão.  - Coffee: All this would be for naught if the coffee were sub-standard. But Nick would never allow such a thing. He knew his beans, could speak the lingo, and one can easily tell he’s not one of those cappuccino charlatans peddling robusta chicanery to every tourist within shouting distance.  All in, I couldn’t be happier. Being one who rarely writes reviews, this was worth it. Nick should be proud and so should the city of San Francisco."
HITW Coffee,"Great ""Hole in the Wall"" coffee shop with a friendly neighborhood feel. The staff is incredibly friendly and leaves you feeling picked up even before the coffee is served. They have drip coffee but on a sunny day I can't resist a coconut cold brew while I sit outside, chat with other locals or read the paper. It's a pleasant way to start the day."
HITW Coffee,"My pour over was very weak, but the service was excellent."
HITW Coffee,This place *is* literally a hole in the wall and looks adorable. They have a selection of pour over coffees on offer - I tried and really liked the Redhead. The barista was super friendly. A very nice San Francisco experience.
HITW Coffee,"Great little spot for a pour over. A true hole in the wall. Although they are posted open 7-3PM make sure not to go around lunch time when the barista takes a lunch break 12:55-1:15 or you could be waiting a while for a simple cup of Joe. Limited services, seating and odd hours may steer your group to many of the other fantastic coffee bars in the area with continued service. Enjoy North Beach."
HITW Coffee,"Coco cold brew is life. Service is outstanding. These folks treat you like you've been neighbors for decades. Not only is it my number one favorite coffee spot in all of the bay area, it's also run by good people. Everything on the menu is stellar. Keep up the great work you guys because I can't image an sf without my HITW Coco cold brew. And the love from the people blessing us with this good stuff is so genuine. ❣️"
HITW Coffee,"When I saw that the name of this place was Hole In The Wall Coffee, I didn't think it was literally a hole in the wall. But I guess some books can be judged by its cover, or at least its name. I was honestly hoping for a place to sit down and wait for my table at the nearby pizza restaurant, so I was a little disappointed when I saw that there was no indoor seating. But I suppose that's my fault for assuming a name like ""Hole In The Wall Coffee"" was some sort of strange euphemism.  The coffee itself was very good. The pour over was smooth and tasted like it could easily have cost $7-8. Very glad it was only $4! Even though there was no indoor seating, sitting on the chairs outside with a steaming cup of coffee actually turned out to be perfect."
HITW Coffee,"good little spot to stop by and grab a coffee! they don’t do lids, environmentally conscious! the menu was a little intimidating for me, however the barista was very kind and walked me through it! their cold brew is made from a concentrate and can add anything to it. the barista was super friendly and kind! definitely a good little local spot to hit up and support!"
HITW Coffee,Wonderful coffee in North Beach. Espresso is rich and dark without bitterness. They also have a selection of coffee grounds.  The barista is friendly and wonderfully helpful. He squeezed in a drink for me as he was about to close. Also advised helpfully on options.  Good outdoor seating on a quieter side street for North Beach. Great location near Washington Square Park.
HITW Coffee,"This neighborhood coffee shop has got to be the absolute best place I've ever been to, the most knowledgeable and funny and friendly barista, and by far the best bean - and coffee concoctions made by a ""coffee scientist"". So happy to have found the hole on the wall on North Beach - GO HERE to have coffee of an elevated and sophisticated nature and meet intelligent people...."
HITW Coffee,Least consistent coffee shop in the city. Never open.
HITW Coffee,"Hours need to be updated.  Waste of time to come here, find a trustee document saying it's been sold."
HITW Coffee,Ran late that day and the coffee shop owner poured me a cup of espresso. I love people in SF :))
HITW Coffee,great coffee!!! I loved the coco cold brew!!!
HITW Coffee,"Heard from proprietor ,not  closed just closed on a weekend while we were there, ill check back next visit."
HITW Coffee,Hi Phil - we're not closed permanently. It just looks that why when we're not open - building is historic so when we close the window it's just a wall. I'd politely ask you to update/remove your review. A 1 star is the opposite of our 10 year track record. Thanks - Nick 
HITW Coffee,The guy there on Fridays makes some really weak coffee. Disappointing.
HITW Coffee,Best coffee in San Francisco. The owner is super nice and an easygoing guy. They roast their own beans and they are damn good. I highly recommend this place to all coffee lovers!
HITW Coffee,"Well named, it's a small space with only outdoor seating. V. Good coffee (drip). Clearly a neighborhood space with regulars (customers, not the New England/New York coffee order).   Nice trees shading the seats. On the other hand, don't go there if you are looking for a range of pastries to choose from. But for a good cup of coffee, absolutely"
HITW Coffee,"This place as great and affordable, for sf, pour over coffees. There is no line so just trust the barista has you and will get to you. If you’re hung over try the coconut cold brew"
HITW Coffee,"Most importantly: the coffee is very good. They usually have 4 different roasts to choose from, and extract via pour over. The cold brew is also good, but overpriced in my opinion. The vibe is awesome - very SF. If you are in north beach and need a caffeine fix, this should be your first stop."
HITW Coffee,Best coffee and best vibes in San Francisco. Recommend the north beach roast and getting a coconut to drink on a hot day
HITW Coffee,"Excellent service and delicious coffee. It was a cold day so I got the blonde roast, but the coco cold brew is a must try"
HITW Coffee,"Literally a hole in the wall cubby with pour overs. They don’t have an espresso machine so it is limited but still perfect for a cup on the go. I really liked they had a blonde, medium, and brunette along with coconuts.  Tiny, cozy, but still perfect for the neighborhood."
HITW Coffee,The coco cold brew was amazing! The coconut water was so fresh. This hole in the wall is a must try!
HITW Coffee,"There is no other iconoclasm like this in all of North Beach. The little kiosk, or the person inside of it dispenses wonderful tea and I assume, or have seen, I just don't drink it, coffee. The charm of slurping it on the street with whatever pastry they have or a cheap corner store pie is unbeatable. To sit on the street, in one of their funky chairs, like you own the street is a Bohemian privilege that could be long lost but isn't. The tea I had today had so much love in it, the perfume scented my thoughts. I sat there with my daughter like I was in the catbird seat. The guy was unqualifiably nice. I happen to know the edifice of this place was the murder wall of a gay night club in the 60's cult movie Sniper."
HITW Coffee,"A drip coffee ¿stand? with not too much selection, but still a fun distinctive big city coffee experience."
HITW Coffee,"The service wasn't that nice, the coffee was weak since the lady literally just poured the water once, no timing, no pouring technique at all. In summary, a bad first experience for a 4 dlls coffee."
HITW Coffee,Amazing coffee! Great vibes here.
HITW Coffee,Fab coffee. Obviously passionate about coffee and the community!
HITW Coffee,"It is not only the coolest hole in the wall place, but their coffee (pour over) is genuinely good! Well if you fancy fresh coconut water, this place got you!"
HITW Coffee,"Not only was the coffee superb, the atmosphere nice and quaint, but the conversation was amazing. Just passing through San Fran and I was given the best suggestions by the barista on where to go in town, can't wait to have the coffee once again!"
HITW Coffee,"Was walking by and decided to support small businesses during this time. Only drip coffee available but he offered milk, sugar, and hand sanitizer! Chatty guy and good experience. They also sell bags of coffee for $18."
HITW Coffee,"This is an awesome walk-up concept with seating to relax while you enjoy your first sips! Freindly staff fantastic pour over coffee, and great aesthetic! Highly recommended!"
HITW Coffee,"In North Beach there isn't much pour over places due to hectic mornings. I mean who has time to stand and wait for a pour over when most people just want coffee to go with minimal wait time right? Well, you've come to the right place. HITWC is all about hanging out while sipping away. They've two seats and numerous pour over paper cone filter ready to go. Plus they're furbaby friendly. I don't think they've dog biscuits now only water bowl. No matter who's behind the counter, that person is uber friendly. You can go behind counter and take a picture of you being a barista. Just asked them during slow times and you're good to go. I'm glad to be living nearby with so many options for coffee. I often wander by on weekends to Cafe Trieste, but when it's a full house HITWC is my next choice."
HITW Coffee,"Really nice, no frills, specialty coffee. I really love their blonde and their North Beach brews. Lovely staff/owner as well."
HITW Coffee,Delicious coffee and the service is fantastic. Great place and will be back!!

HITW Coffee,"Very limited selection,  no frills coffee spot. Coffee was nice and smooth.  This is yet another place that crushed the burnt garbage they sell at Starbucks."
HITW Coffee,My daily ritual place! Fresh coffee smell wakes me up and this is the place where local people meet each other and have real talk. I love it.
HITW Coffee,"Friendly staff, outdoor seating, and delicious pour overs make this hidden gem a must visit coffee spot in the city."
HITW Coffee,My husband loves their coffee. It truly is a hole in the wall kind of place. But their coffee tastes good.

HITW Coffee,Everything is literal at HITW - which was a great experience. Tasty filter coffee (despite wanting a flat white which is apparently coming to their menu which is great!)
HITW Coffee,"Absolutely legendary coffee... Um... Place? Appropriately named, this spot is a tiny caffeine dispensary with order ahead by text."
HITW Coffee,"It's a good brew, although there's a limited selection. Great for a basic light/medium/dark brew or cold coffee."
HITW Coffee,Coffee was excellent! No food fyi (Google sent me there for breakfast and no such luck) but friendly employee and great coffee!
HITW Coffee,"Nice enough fella serving up some pour overs, but the coffee was both mediocre and overpriced. I ended up pouring most of mine out."
HITW Coffee,Coffee was ok but service was very slow. If you are a regular the owner will chat with you but we ended up waiting 10 mins for our order
HITW Coffee,"Love their coffee, but their service is tops. Lucky to have spotted this off the beaten path gem"
HITW Coffee,"The owner is a very nice chap, coffee tasted great."
HITW Coffee,"Great coffee, and good conversation while waiting for it to brew. Would definitely go here again."

HITW Coffee,"It's a shop where everything is hand dripped. The coffee is a bit weak, but they use good beans, so it's worth the money you paid. If you buy coffee beans, you get a free drink. Maybe because it's a local restaurant, people sat nearby and had a pleasant conversation with the owner. If your accommodation is nearby, I recommend you to stop by! I also bought coffee beans, but they are quite savory and have a deep flavor."
HITW Coffee,Hi Shyam - we’re sorry to hear you had a poor experience. Can you please let us know what happened? Thank you - Nick
