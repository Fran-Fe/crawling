Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Both the kiosk by the woods and the cafe by the street are great option for a cup of fine coffee depending on your mood. Love the Cortado with balanced mix of beans and milks. Pet friendly. Lot of seats and lot of spaces. Great place in SF for a break.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Stopped in for breakfast coffee n food. First time here.  Got got Hot Chocolate which tasted powdery, and a Chai which tasted like a Mexican (spicy) hot chocolate.  Also grabbed a Danish which was very good.   All the pastries looked great but none were labeled.  Had to keep interrupting the only person working the counter.  Service was below average, but probly because they only had one employee at the counter.  Place was kinda dark inside, but had a good vibe.  Location is extremely convenient if going to Golden Gate Park."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Hip coffee cafe. Friendly and helpful staff. Coffee was not the best I have had in SF, but just my opinion, you may love it. Everything else is excellent s."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Okay-ish coffee. The cappuccino was good, but not spectacular. The Nitro BREW had some weird taste, we didn’t like it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Came here on a Sunday morning and though the line was long, it turns out that it was well justified! I got a pour-over and my partner got a nitro and they were both incredibly good! Like, one of the best coffees of my life! We both got baked goods, mine were gluten-free (thank you for having gluten-free items!) that were high quality and tasty."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Hipster cafe nearby UCSF hospital. I got latte with oatmilk👍🏽This place is good for gathering. (not a silent study cafe) But parking is really hard to find…! or you need to pay street parking around the park and Whole Foods Market.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice cafe with one of the best hot chocolates I’ve had.. I got their coffee beans for my husband and he loves their coffee.. if you’re lucky you can find street parking.. I’ll be back here again to try different items on their menu.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Always a great time, spacious and amazing coffee! Small cute patio at the back, perfect for a sunny day. Wifi included for 2 hours w a purchase"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Amazing coffee shop to get some work done! The WiFi is solid and so is the coffee! Don’t miss the coffee crumble cake - I devoured it in less than 5 mins! Would love to go back!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,My daily coffee call recommended by our AirBnb.. amazing coffee and tasty pastry selection. Highly recommend for a satisfying caffeine break 😎 …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I mean this cafe is incredible. The coffee here is fantastic. Great great specialty coffee shop with siphon brewing. While it doesn’t radically change the coffee, it’s a good experience to have. Make you feel fancy. The cafe is nice and big, with a cute patio in a back. Definitely should go here!! We bought a bag off coffee, which did not disappoint!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Excellent atmosphere to sip coffee and get some work done. Limited timed wifi.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I was nearby and wanted to try this cafe. Not bad coffee at all.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"This place is highly recommended by my peers so I had to check it out! The place is cozy and the staff are friendly. I had my first ever mocha here which was delicious. The gold rush was alright, but the tortilla stuck to the foil and I had to scrape it off with a spoon. Would come again for the coffee.  Total was $11"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great vibes, excellent coffee. Lots of space to sit, stand, hang out, and work. Good wifi and accessible power outlets. My only complaint is that they were understaffed for weekend rushes. I was there for almost four hours on a Sunday and the staff were busting their butts trying to keep up with demand basically the whole time. I think customers and staff could benefit from the owner scheduling at least one more person on busy weekends. And given the volume of business, it seems like they can afford it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"10/10 espresso, 10/10 atmosphere. Nice low lighting. You could spend all day here. Super friendly baristas. Lots of people WFH here. But again, coffee is 10/10 incredible. You can tell they put their heart into their roasts."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good vibes, great coffee. 5/5 would come back for a quick coffee or to work for the day."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee by the park! Cozy coffee place with indoor and outdoor seating. They have patio in the back to enjoy outdoors. There is a park right across to the coffee shop. So, you can pick the coffee and go on a stroll in the park.  Coffee is smooth - well balanced flavor. The price is almost same as Starbucks. You can even go for Siphon coffee for a different experience. Siphon coffee is couple of dollars more than the normal one."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,great cafe to stop by before strolling around golden gate park with decent selection of pastries. enjoyed the cardamom bun and latte.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Came here to work and it was a great place to do it given everyone else was doing the same.  The cortado was expertly done. Had the Ethiopian pour over as well and it was 👌
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Located along a few mini lines; has hot beverages and pasties, including vegan/gluten free ones (which they keep on a separate tray and label).  The cafe unfortunately looses a few stars because they charge extra for vegan/plant based milks; would give the place higher stars if they didn’t have the vegan milk surcharge."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,A local favorite for specialty coffee! Great place to sip and people watch. Decent amount of space to work. And lots of parking nearby. Good cafe choice
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Overall consistently made coffees across baristas, and typically really friendly counter staff, sharing and engaging in common interests. The mochas are typically delicious, but as with any cafe or retail store, sometimes the new hires are not as skilled or friendly. I asked for a sleeve and was given attitude by the barista today, and I mentioned it was very hot. She reacted annoyed saying it was the normal temperature. Well, it burned my tongue aftward. So if you're a regular, I'd advise looking to see who that days barista is."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,love their coffee. its worth the ten minute walk from where i live to go here :))
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Crafted Siphon coffee and espresso drinks with a focus on high quality beans and extractions! Have it with one of their many  delicious croissants.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Had to try their siphon coffee (a first for me). The $7 price tag was hard to swallow, but the coffee went down so smooth! It felt so rich and flavorful, some of the best coffee I’ve had. Will definitely be back."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Tasty coffee, very friendly staff and great vibe. Love the industrial decor!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Delicious coffee! And nice location across from Golden Gate Park. Gets very busy on weekends.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I really like this place! This is a minimalist coffee that I loved! You have to go! There are many people working and drinking coffee.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"During this trip to San Francisco, Flywheel served the best cup of coffee I had during the week. The staff were nice, made an effort to remember my name, and greeted everyone. This place is great."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,nice to see so many dogs brought by customers. best place to kill time!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Very good Cortado, expect 10-15 minute wait for them to take your order."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great spot to work remotely! Relaxed staff and good coffee, not a ton of seats but if you can find one it’s worth a sit."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Best coffee we had in SF by far!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee in a hip, clean spot with quick service and regular prices. Cappuccino recommended, avoid the cold brew unless you like sour coffee."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good spot to have a cafe. Located very close to the golden gate park. Good coffee. Gets busy during the day, get here early to get a good spot if you are looking to work."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great location right across the street from Golden Gate Park and very near Haight Street. Top-quality coffee roasted in house. And great prices too for coffee beans.  Popular place with locals and tourists alike. Pleasant interior and nice people who know how to pull a good cappuccino.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I don't understand the hype and all the positive reviews.  The overpriced coffee is not worth the visit. The customer service is very poor at this location. Try another local cafe in this area.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Our coffees were ok, but the real disappointment was our son’s “hot chocolate”, which basically tasted like honey milk. He couldn’t have more than 2 sips and we ended up throwing it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good ambiance and good coffee. Friendly folks
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Lovely example of a step above coffee experience. Lots of pour overs and siphons but not pretentious. Snacks are tasty, too."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Cool aura, great staff. Good work environment. Lots of people go in and out which can be little distracting. But grab some coffee and get in the grind!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,the really tall man with the big hair is a very nice worker.he made me the best coffe i have ever had
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,First time here and the coffee is delicious and smooth.  You should try it one day.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Friendly staff and relaxed vibe. Great for a quick bite.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Cute little mom and pop coffee shop. Sometimes you just need a change of pace from Starbucks and this place will do it!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and a great place to hang out / do work.  Multiple seating options inside and outside and just across the street in the park.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, great interior and location! Loved it"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Hip (is it still hip if I say hip?) coffee shop just across the street from the park with a warm atmosphere. Now to the part that really matters, yes, great coffee and tasty baked goods."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Coffee was a bit weak for my liking. Some staff appeared ro care more about socializing than serving.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Best Latte with Almond milk in SF I saw many people working with their lap I love this cozy atmosphere and location is also good it is close to Goldengate park I highly recommend!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I visited this location as part of a “I’m in SF for 2 days so I’m going to visit all the good coffee places” tour. This is my third stop.  I absolutely loved the aesthetic of this shop (see photos). It’s rustic and very open with plenty of seating space.  I ordered a cortado, and it was decent. The coffee taste was good, but the drink had too much foam on top (see photo).  Overall, I prefer the espresso drinks from Ritual, but I would still recommend getting a drink here!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"We ordered an iced latte, cold brew, and an espresso and everything was delightful! The espresso was pulled nicely even though it was a hefty volume double shot, and the iced latte was a really good proportion. (I hate when it’s basically just coffee flavored milk). The cold brew was a little too big though, I would prefer a WAY smaller size for less money because that’s way too much at once lol"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and amazing pastries!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee and great ambience. There were too many people though, as we are still in a pandemic."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and atmosphere. Nice to have so much room in a neighborhood where a lot of coffee shops can feel cramped.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Very pretty,  nice Cafe. Quick service.  Busy but organized."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Atmosphere was nice but barista was super rude (I wanted a certain type of coffee but he kept acting like he didn’t think that was what I wanted… after I insisted he eventually made it anyways). I noticed most of the clientele was white, so maybe I was just an outlier and wasn’t treated with the usual manners."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Top quality espresso and pour over coffee.  Monkey bread and donuts are fantastic. My favorite place for coffee in the neighborhood.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Flywheel is maybe currently my favorite Haight/nopa coffee shop, although it seems to be true for everyone and the lines have been long lately! The baristas are great, the lattes are great, the pastry case is solid.  The register person sometimes seems to be more interested in socializing than expediting order throughput (thus the line). Often hard to find a seat, heavy laptop crowd, but that's ok, go across the street to the park."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and friendly staff. I’m told the pastries were “as good as in France”.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Love the vibes and coffee! Very nice and cosy cafe.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Really cool spot. Great coffee, the breads are good but the scones not so much. Highly recommend if you need a place to relax and work.  Update: I have been frequenting this place during the entire pandemic, and the equality has maintained. The coffee is delicious, the pastries amazing, and the service is always fast and friendly. Highly recommend checking this place out and if you're in the area. Make sure to tip your barista! They are also wonderful and friendly, and have stayed so positive during this entire event.  Another update: they have amazing covid-19 protocol and have the entire pandemic. Go check them out"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Excellent espresso coffee on par with Sydney and Melbourne 😂😂 …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Loved everything about this coffee shop! The coffee & pastries were delicious, staff were polite and helpful in narrowing down which flavour/type of coffee to choose. Nice atmosphere, glad we stumbled upon this place after making a wrong turn trying to get to our destination."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,My wife and I tried two different single origin coffees as pour overs and they were both very tasty. The location was perfect for grabbing coffee before spending the day in Golden Gate Park.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, love the croissant and the price it’s pretty decent."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Super cute asthetic. Nicely priced. In a great location, I had no trouble finding local parking.  Wifi is available for 2 hrs, with additional time available upon request.  Only downside was the hot cocoa was a bit light in chocolate flavor, I like mine really rich. Latte tasted great though."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and biscotti. Loved the decor and friendly staff.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"One of the best lattes, served with 💝 …"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Pastry was old, coffee was bitter and burnt tasting, no value for money, they're slipping in quality based on previous visits"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Greeted with typical SF attitude; cold and snobby. Except for the guy that made the coffee he was nice, surprisingly. Coffee was great. They ""don't do flavors"" fyi which is fine, because the coffee is tasty all on its own."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,They have good coffee. But the service was so so bad
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Darn good coffee ! Absolutely loved it .
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Our go to every Saturday or Sunday during our bike rides! Love the staff and supreme quality coffee!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice selection of teas Street parking Baked good sold here Not a ton of seating Wi-Fi offered Great to stop by and have an iced drink before going to the park
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The best coffee in Haight!! The staff are so sweet, funny, and knowledgeable. Their coffee and pastries are amazing. They have vegan options as well. Pro tip: grab a cup to go and walk Golden Gate Park."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Pour over Sumatran coffee so good- cosy ambiance. Good prices.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,The BEST coffee I had since I came to San Francisco. Their sweets also are really delicious
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee shop with lots of space, great ambiance, and excellent coffee."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"...couldn’t bear to stop drinking my cold brew for a cute pic. Flywheel is the best way to kick off your morning! Love their cold brew and nitro cold brew! Also the store itself is such an aesthetic (not pictured obviously). Bonus points for the playlist as well. Cheers, Flywheel!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Very quickly becoming my favorite coffee shop around the park. Has amazing coffee...and espresso. The team is friendly and the service is right. You can tell their barista has some serious training and experience... perfect every time! They have a few things to eat from local bakeries. I like that they roast their own beans and that they allow you to sit in front of the equipment (all top notch by the way)! As a former coffee shop owner myself...I can be pretty picky.. but these guys won me over with the quality of the coffee and the ambiance. I like how the spaced out the seating.. you don't feel like your sitting on top of people and feel like your in your own conversations. Well done owners of Flywheel!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Exceptional coffee, a good vibe, and super tasty food options."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Had a pretty solid experience all around and genuinely appreciated the ability to buy the amount of coffee beans I preferred rather than having to commit to a whole pound at one time. I was just confused because when I asked the roast date of the beans, they mentioned June 4th but when I got the bag of coffee there was a sticker on it that said June 26. Not sure if that was an accident but when it comes to consistency, i’d rather prefer an accurate honest date then potentially making a customer feel like they’re putting out an image of freshness when it’s not."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee we had in San Francisco over our visit. Lovely vibe. Several tables absorbed by solo people working remotely - wifi must be decent! If full, try their place opposite on the edge of the park for an outside seat."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,The coffee here is always on point and they have delicious hot chocolate for those winter days when you need something warm and cozy in your stomach. Their service also leaves nothing to be desired-the staff are friendly which makes this place great if you want some peace of mind while enjoying a cup by yourself!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good place to sit down and work while enjoying a good cup of coffee. They use various ways to make their coffee, so if like variety it will be a good place for you."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Amazing coffee and incredible vibe. Perfect for hanging out or working.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,This place checks ALL the boxes (including dog friendly). My favorite coffee shop in SF.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee. Perfect place to grab a cup before you disappear into the park. Or somewhere else. I won’t tell you where to disappear into.  They also have nice breakfast burritos.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Best Coffee in the Haight Ashbury area. Great Baristas, friendly hip vibe."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"All you need in a coffee/roasting house. Good baked treats (gluten free selection) good vibes, good location and people/dog friendly environment. Yep, it's all there and Fatima makes an excellent Latte."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great quality coffee and atmosphere!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I was harassed by another customer, shop workers didn't care at all."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I liked the atmosphere and the service, but the espresso I got was way too acidic. I don't know what went wrong in the making of it, maybe the temperature was too low? Or grind was too coarse?"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Cold brew is so good. Strong, bold, chalky. Possibly my favorite coffee shop in SF!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Utter disappointment is how I'd describe flywheel. Unlike other reviews that mentioned bad service, my experience was fine, our order was taken promptly, we found seating and were not rushed out.  However the preparation of the coffee was disappointing and while the siphon looks cool, if it's not going to be done right, why offer it? My cup was not pre-heated, and I was warned that my coffee would be VERY hot and that I should let it cool.  Additionally, my wife ordered an iced americano and simply received iced espresso and was instructed where to add her own water if she wanted an americano, even though that's what she ordered.  Nothing terrible, but just not up to the standard of coffee I look for in a small independent roaster in San Francisco. They definitely need to tighten up their attention to detail and the quality of service they provide."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Coffee was pretty good. Lighting a little dim inside. Wifi a little spotty and expires after 2 hours. I had to send a few more emails before leaving and asked for the code but was told ""sorry bro you have to buy something else to keep using it."" Locals only kinda vibes."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good mocha, power bar pastry was actually really good if you like peanut butter, and staff was friendly."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Delicious , dark blend, cortado and fresh bakery crumb cakes  Enjoyed the cortado and cinnamon crumb cake! However if you want a very smooth light flavored blend you might want to look elsewhere. The bakery items are sourced locally and super fresh so you can’t go wrong there."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and very friendly baristas! 👌👌👌 …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The coffee is affordable & pretty good and the atmosphere is nice, but all of the workers (except for one) were super snobby and rude. I was only there for about 45 minutes and the whole time I was given dirty looks. One of the workers, I think her name was Maddie, was especially rude, she rolled her eyes when my friend asked if they offered tea."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Lovely calm atmosphere with an amazing coffee and baristas
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Coffee is good but service is absolutely average.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee in a casual comfortable spot. Knowledge and helpful staff. Espresso was too bright but the Ethiopian pour over was good.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Staff was shockingly rude when dealing with some fickle kids. Didn't expect this harsh reaction at all, this place seems chill by the park but the guy working the counter was really mean to us."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Delicious crumb cake. Friendly staff. Interesting atmosphere.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Flywheel makes my favorite espresso in the entire Bay Area! For real though, I got bored and extra during the pandemic, and made a tournament bracket where I compared espresso from 75 Bay Area shops, 25 of which were in the city. Flywheel was the best, rich, sweet, and complex in flavor. I go out of my way to come here, it's worth it even when it takes 20 minutes to find a parking spot!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Always a great vibe and good coffee
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,We love this place! Great coffee and great pastries
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The espresso is good; the staff is nice; the new outdoor space is beautiful. When the shop is open, they have a good variety of seating, which leads to a nice mixture of people going there to work and going there for a quick stop in."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Large space, lots of tables to work on but busy, right next to the park!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and service!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great place to fire up the laptop and get some work done
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"This place is a block away from my AirBnb apartment, so I walked here for my morning coffee knowing nothing about the cafe.  What I discovered is that it is reminiscent of cafes in Europe, very basic, no frills - not even flavored syrups.  Also, no venti/grande coffees.  You don't get a choice - one size!  Which is how it is in Europe.  I can appreciate this.  And the important part:  very good coffee.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the lack of customer service.  When I first approached the counter I started looking at the pastries.  The guy at the register did not greet me or acknowledge me in any way.  After a couple of minutes, I looked up ready to order and a woman asked for my order.  I gave her the pastry order and then ordered a hot latte.  I asked if there are syrups.  She said, ""No, but our coffee is really good.""  She rang it up and that was it, no thank you, have a good day, nothing.  I don't expect chipper and asking about my plans for the day, especially not at 7:30am, but just the basic, minimal amount of customer services would be good.  Again, they weren't rude, but they weren't friendly either."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great location, good coffee, handcrafted pour over, really good quality. Enjoyed the experience, nice ambiance as well!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I'm coffee freak from India. I love this shop coffee. Caapacuino I ordered it's tremendous. I love the taste and aroma. The way the brew coffee is outstanding and taste so good. Coffee lovers must visit. They got Ethiopia and houndarous coffee beans.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Excellent coffee. Cool interior. Great location. Needs some comfier seating, but otherwise cool place."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The blonde barista should learn a few manners. She was rude and unprofessional to me on one occasion and I let it slide, and then again today. I had been sitting for about ten minutes before she came up to me at a table and told me she needed to see my vaccination card, and also I needed to order something to sit here. I was waiting at a table for a friend to come, and half the cafe was vacant so it wasn’t like it was busy. There were three people to my right (all seated and not masked) and two to my left (also all seated and not masked). I was the only one she walked up to to inquire about proof of vaccination out of everyone in the cafe. She was not asking for proof of vaccination at the register either. She also said that even seated that I needed to be masked… and she said nothing to the other customers who were unmasked right next to me. I have no problems with masks whatsoever, but never have I been to an establishment since a pandemic started where someone who worked there said I needed to be masked while seated, and that I needed to get up and order something to stay there. And then to single me out among everyone else. Sad to say I will not be returning because of how awkward and anxious I felt afterward for being singled out and told I needed to buy some thing in order to continue sitting even though I was waiting for someone to join me. I felt so uncomfortable after this that I texted my friend who I was meeting there to not come, and we met up elsewhere. This had been a regular spot for me to come and do work, have a coffee, or something to snack on, but not after this experience. Plenty of other options out there with more hospitality. Good job!!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee and fast wifi after you register with the temp email
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Modern, vibrant and unique coffee place with great vibes!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great if you just want straight up coffee. The ambiance was very hard-core coffee but the interior looks really cool. It's pretty pricey though.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I stopped by Flywheel Coffee Roasters after a run and really enjoyed it. The cold brew was very good, but the real standout was the blueberry crumb cake, which was perfect. Flywheel is also in a cool area near Golden Gate Park."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Not many coffee options but their stuff is freshly made and tastes nice. They have a bunch of nice places to sit and work in along with power outlets and really nice ambience.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Cozy& nice place
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Beautiful coffee shop right across the street of golden gate park! They have the nicest staff and great coffee. It's a nice working/socializing atmosphere - you can just be who you are there! Love it!

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Friendly, fast service. Reasonably priced. Great coffee! Didn't order a pastry, but they looked good."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Coffee was good. Very limited menu. Ambience in the seating area below average
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. Their pourover is excellent, and they always have 3 choices for beans."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Awesome coffee place.  The coffee tastes great -- rich and fresh.  Great way to start the day.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Out Go-To place in Haight and we often purchase coffee beans here
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee and a great environment to get some work done.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I would like to Thank Flywheel for their compassionate kindness as I am a woman in my mid-years enduring a very lonely journey being homeless while a tooth that needs dental attention became severally infected and I was taking rest in the park near Flywheel for several days, very sick and in severe pain, Flywheel generously supplied for me, at no charge, ice to ice the swelling in my face and hot water for cup-a-noodles as eating was very difficult. Thank You Flywheel for your compassionate kindness that is more precious to me than all the worlds gold.  Your coffee is also quite good with being prepared with very loving personal care hand-brewed into every cup, Thank You."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Delicious pour-over coffee. One of the best tasting I've had.

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and very nice people.  Try the coffee siphon if you have time.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice variety of drip coffee, in a spacious but not too comfortable place. Food choices could be better and more varied. Definitely go here if you want dripper coffee, but that's it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,my favorite coffee shop around the park. Has amazing coffee...and espresso. The team is friendly and the service is right. You can tell their barista has some serious training and experience... perfect every time!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I love pour single-origins from here. Always a great, insightful and warm conversation with the baristas; about all things coffee and the city. Loved being able to brew their beans throughout the pandemic!"

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and atmosphere - sometimes gets too crowded and the seating is a little short.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Very friendly staff. Good coffee. Reliable WiFi. Great place to work out of. There is an extension across the road with outdoor seats as well.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"This place is an awesome coffee shop to just read. The bad thing about this place is that their internet is definitely not good. However, the cafe is a great place to think and read a good book for hours. The coffee is good and there is a bunch of seating. Great place to check out if you want to just chill and hang out alone."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Outstanding coffee. One of the top two in the Haight. Location next to the park is perfect. They also have a nice patio
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Very good coffee and great location by th park.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good local coffee shop near Golden Gate Park. Better the some of the other options nearby.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Awesome place to get good coffee! Vibe is great and would recommend. (Outlets and WiFi) (Cash only)
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Don't really make use of the space they have. Only a few areas to sit with no power outlets. Service not great. Coffee average.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great atmosphere in front of the park and good cappuccino. The staff is friendly. Would definitely recommend grabbing a coffee here on your way to the park.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee but limited food selection. Wi-Fi and a few outlets. Nice interior and small patio in back.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee. Super chill spot to hang out next to the park

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee. Feels very spacious, and actually has WiFi. Like the back patio."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Nice outdoor seating in the back
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,The coffee was okay at best and you have to keep purchasing from the shop to extend your wifi every 2 hours... Seems a little cheap and I'm now regretting my $2 extra tip to them as I have to keep paying for items I don't want in exchange for wifi.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Love the coffee and vibe here! They also have nice juices to go.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee I’ve had in America. This include New York City, Boston etc. do yourself a favor and get one."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Chill coffee house. Nice place.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Good staff. Nice snacks and space.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,One of my favorite coffee places in sf. Definitely the best in the area and reasonably priced
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,This place is awesome if you are looking for a good place to work. There are plenty of electrical outlets and no one makes you feel like you have over extended your stay. Just buy their great coffee and tip well.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice place to grab a coffee and work. Lots of space and a cute outdoor area.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,awesome hot latte ☕️😍👍🏻 …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Super cozy and opens relatively late (6 PM). Wi-Fi is fast too!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Yummy vegan pastries. Right across from the park!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I got a Nitro cold brew with almond milk from an extremely rude woman and it's so sour that it's actually undrinkable.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Cool place with friendly, skilled staff. The one criticism I have is that they steam the milk too hot."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,My neighborhood coffee shop that never ceases to amaze me. Very kind baristas and a nice selection of baked goods too. I love that it opens up so early during the week too.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,This place has a great vibe and does real good coffees!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Haven't been there in few months but I was regular last year. Staff was super friendly and professional, decor is inviting and coffee very nice."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Big fan of the espresso beverages here. Great selection of pastries and local pressed juices or other non-caffeinated drinks. Good space for work or a coffee date. Small back patio.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice spot with pretty good Coffee,  I like sitting at the window and watching people walk by."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Ordered and paid $3.50 for an Americano in 1 minute. Waited in line for at least 10 minutes, still no coffee in hand 😥😬 It might have been a busy day. If you don't want to wait for your coffee, this is not your place. If you do, give it a try ☕ …"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Excellent coffee and beautiful cafe! They also have hot and iced  teas, which is not apparent from pics here."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,super good - try the affogato
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I’d say the most mediocre chocolate croissant that rivaled Costco in plainness but not in price
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I stumbled on the place randomly when I stopped to warm up from a chilly motorcycle ride. Friendly service and good coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed and it's not crowded (at least while I was there)
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee nut they had run out of most of the food options by 2pm
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,This page is filled with obviously fake reviews. How can I get paid to do that? I would do a much better job - without the awkward english and lack of any supporting detail. Are local coffee shops so hard up that they need to hire overseas fake reviews writers? Damn.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I love this coffee shop. The best around
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Excellent location, beautiful interior, very friendly and informed staff, great coffee."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,One of my favorite coffee places in SF - taste really good and has great atmosphere.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,We were sitting having coffee and one of the employees came by and told us they are closing and when we mentioned that the listing on google indicated that they are closing an hour later he became extremely rude and downright offensive. Don’t come back.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Love the Golden Gate Park pop up!  Unfortunately there was a very loud customer loitering inside the small space talking to the barista. I had to squeeze inside the shop to order along with this customer. Given how small this space is multiple customers at once is too much during COVID. Seems like the staff should really enforce one customer at a time.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice place to warm up after walking through Golden Gate park, a lots of people with laptops. I guess this place is also great for remote work with a cup of great coffee."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I like this place inside. For some reason I just don't get on with the pour over coffee or the espresso.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I am a regular at Flywheel. Great coffee and friendly baristas. Also. always  good music playing. What's not to like! I'm there 5 or 6 times a week.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and ambience! Will definitely go back!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice place for awesome coffee and baked goodies in the morning
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Excellent cold brew
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great Staff, Great Coffee, Great Escape from the Hippie Trash across the street and down it. I'd want to bring my laptop and work for hours next time :) If you want a coffee place that is low key, and vibrant, go here!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great atmosphere and good coffee, but the staff was super rude and irritable."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good pour over. Friendly service. Clean restroom. Space feels both roomy and cozy. Small back patio.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,The coffee was mediocre at best. With all of the good coffee in the city it would be hard for me to justify going here over many other great options that exist in the city.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Excellent coffee. Ethiopian beans were just like I remember when I had the real deal. Great vibe, some nice cakes/pastries also. Slightly too many mac users though ;)"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Hipster almost to the point where it's no longer interesting, (and I live in the Mission). Maybe there was something about the place not being quite as genuine as one would have hoped. My coffee was, nevertheless, delivered superbly."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Trendy coffee place. Very open layout, lots of space, with some outdoor seating in back. They don't seem to mind if people hang out a while to do work and they're friendly to dogs - even keep a water dish outside that they actually keep clean."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Sweet people welcoming you and they make a really Nice hot chocolate - the Thick and not to sweet one that you Will crave days after 🙏🏼 …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"First time here and the coffee is really good, and they created a really nice modern setup.  Also has a sunny back patio, and is pet friendly with clean bathroom."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Great vibe. Wonderful place to have a coffee after visiting the Golden Gate Park. I had an Americano and it was a very nice cup of coffee.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Really good coffee and very big coffee place to go and hang / work. It even has a patio
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Cute location across the park. They have oat and almond milk dairy alternatives. The oat milk latte and the affogato were good!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice place to hang out with good coffee.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee. Baristas definitely knew how to stream milk. Both decaf and caffeine options (both were good). Loved that they sold fruit. Great locations. Parking is a little bit of a hassle. Lots of seating including some backyard spots.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice vibe and minimal decor. The wait for the coffee wasn't too long. With minimal decor comes minimal steating. Coffee only comes in one size, a 12oz I believe. That being said, the coffee was good. The American wasn't very dark but was very flavorful. Worth a visit."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Really pretty shop space with tasty craft coffee , fresh pastries, and friendly baristas. It also has a beautiful view of Golden Gate Park right across the street!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"When I went there, it was crowded. I set near restouraroom. But soon I moved at the backside. I couldn't see much about moving and clam. If you are looking for a peaceful place with coffee, it is a good place."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Late to discovering this neighborhood spot, but it has delicious coffee and pastries. Extra points for a nice layout with plenty of space to work, sitting or standing. There's even an outdoor patio."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Stupid expensive for coffee but some of the best I've had in the city
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Very cool roast-house, staff was super friendly and made excellent suggestions based on taste preferences."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice vibe with a decent amount of seating in a large space. Wasn’t loud even when fairly full.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,You can see that they put effort into their food. This is my second time here and although I enjoyed the first time I was very impressed this second time.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"This place is the definition of 'not bad'. Everything about it is alright, but nothing has wowed me yet. I'd recommend going the extra mile down to the mill."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Cool coffee shop popular with earnest lap top wielders. Nice seating area out back. Great coffee. Guy who served me a bit vague about which donuts were which.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great baristas, excellent selection of beans, coupled with a wide variety of baked goods (some gluten free). They even have a nice covered patio out back."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great drinks, they roast their own coffee, and it's a good price per lb. On the bright/acidic side of coffee, but is usually very good."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice place,  good coffee and they let you charge your board!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Perfectly brewed coffee, great blueberry coffee cake and a wonderful view of the park. Shout out to Jeff who gave perfect directions and helped me get home after my phone died."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, friendly stuff and awesome homemade puding"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great staff, tasty coffee. Unreliable wifi and expensive coffee."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great atmosphere with really good coffee!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, nice space, lots of outlets, friendly staff. Minus one star fit flaky wifi that wants to email me ads."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,You can not find a better cup.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,one of the best coffee shops in the haight!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee. You should definitely try out the siphon coffee. A really smooth,  clean coffee and the preparation is spectacular."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Never really understood the whole ""Cold brew"" thing until I had it here, made in long ""Blinded me with science"" glass tubes, creating one of the smoothest  simple cups of coffee I've ever had. Nice for a pick me up while roller skating,  or strolling the haight, the coffee here is always spot in."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and an awesome atmosphere.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Love their space and decor! We ordered two drip coffees and those were great too!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee and atmosphere but like most things in SF it's pricey ($4 coffee). Pro tip: when using the free wifi, if you don't confirm your email address it will keep booting you off every 5 minutes"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Always love stopping by here while shopping or heading to the park for some quiet time and good coffee. They make an industrial looking space feel cozy. Lots of people study here. It's fun to watch how the siphon coffee is made, but every kind of coffee drink had been excellent, and they've got a few pastries on hand too."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great food and coffee - awesome location
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and really nice staff.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Cool space, but poorly designed with very little seating considering the size of the venue. The coffee was average, although I struggled to find any good coffee in SF so maybe that's my London perspective."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,If you need delicious strong coffee then this is your go to. Yum!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Best pour over coffee in town, period."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Very friendly and helpful baristas. I ordered the almond milk mocha along a with a morning glory bread. The bread tastes amazing and the mocha with the rich dark chocolate is out of this world.  The atmosphere is quite nice and quiet.  I highly recommend coming here.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Pretty basic coffee shop with people glued to their Mac devices. The coffee itself was good.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice atmosphere. Very high-priced though! And, only light roast."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,This must be one of the best coffee shops ever
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Pretty good, didn't find any bugs in my cold brew coffee. Good place to use the bathroom before walking in the park"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Every time I'm home in SF this is one of my favorite places to get coffee and escape.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great spot right at the start the park.  Great service, the folks that work here are a pleasure.  They roast their own beans and have a large but cozy space if you want to spend some quality time.  Try the unwashed Ethiopian if you want a big bold cup that is nicely balanced and not too berry forward."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The place was neat on the inside but the coffee was horrible ... we tried three: ethopian pour over, Rwandan pour over, and mocha ... all were too bitter"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I love the drip coffee here, it is delicious and well worth the price."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,The coffee is so good. They also make my favorite mocha on Haight st.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. Outdoor patio is awesome. Spacious.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Beautiful space that even allows dogs! They have beans up at the counter for you to sniff before you order your coffee as well. Relaxed vibe with an outdoor garden in back.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Fantastic espresso, and friendly staff. I broke a cup, and offered to pay, but they refused. Really genuine, good people. 10/10"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Regular coffee is weirdly expensive but espresso drinks are fairly priced given the quality. I wish the food selection was a bit wider but all in all this is a good neighborhood coffee shop.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Ambience and coffee both are worth trying.. they have their own coffee that they brew everytime.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Over all good place to have coffee and sit and work. However after two hours of using WiFi, you need to buy something else to continue using WiFi."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,If you like fancy expensive coffee it's fine but 4 dollars for a small coffee forget it !
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice choice of baked goods.  Wish they had some cold drinks.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I've been in the US for a long time. This is the best I ever had! Best coffee in America! ישראלים יקרים, זה הקפה  הכי קרוב לארץ שיש! מומלץ!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Obnoxious music. Bad vibes
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Coffee is fresh roasted, and incredible. Prices are great. Atmosphere is rustic and coffee is served in Mason jars. Great place to stop with a friend."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Very simple yet dependable setup from the layout to the offerings. Mostly a laptop crowd, I used to come here all the time to study."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and tea in a airy but comfortable space.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice decor and ambiance. Great ice tea!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"One of my favorite coffee shops in SF. It's located between the Haight and Golden Gate Park, so it's always easy to make a stop! Coffee tastes great."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"You come here not for the coffee, but for the experience of having coffee. Solid coffee, but not proportioned well considering its price."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great space, great coffee, great service.  Always enjoy my trips to Flywheel."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice, chill, place with good quality drinks and pastries. The only issue is the prices."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Beautiful interior with lots of open space and room to work. The siphon is a really neat process to watch and produces some excellent coffee. It's a bit pricey at $5, but we certainly thought it was worth the experience!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice place, good coffee, good parties,nice people..."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"It's a pleasure to go and enjoy the design first. Real delight for eyes for industrial style lovers. Coffee is great too, they could propose more options to eat  so kids can enjoy it too."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice spot
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great staff, environment, decor, and coffee. Right off of Haight on the cusp of Golden Gate Park, Flywheel is a really good place to hop online and surf the www, while sipping some excellent pour-over coffee."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Exxellent coffee. Great service and delicious Pastries!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Their coffee and pastries are good, but their internet is slow and kicks you off after 2 hours. The only way to get back on the internet is to buy another item. Their slow internet wasn't worth the price of a coffee, so I went somewhere else to work."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great place and people. They source their own been from the farmers. Their Cortado may be the best that I've ever had. It needed no added sugar.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I GREW UP JUST DOWN STANYAN ST. FLYWHEEL COFFEE IS SAN FRANCISCO. WOULDNT GO ELSEWHERE.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Tasty in-house-brewed coffee with a spacious, modern, bright, homey space with local neighborhood vibes! Try the Colombian La Cabaña (pour-over) ✌🏽 …"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Edited my rating from five stars to 1 to reflect my extreme disappoinment with the shop's handling of recent events. I won't be back.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Amazing coffee, cool place to hangout too!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Very nice coffee. Great decor!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"I live in Haight Ashbury and this is my favorite shop in the neighborhood. The coffee is so fresh and well made, there's a ton of seating and standing working spots, and there's wifi and outlets :) And it's right across the street from GGP! Great spot."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Solid brews and nice ambiance to sit back and relax.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"My cold brew tasted really sour and kind of like stale bananas. My boyfriend got a latte which really wasn't that good either. We're not from the area but saw it on a specialty coffee list so we were let down when it turned out not to be good. The place itself is industrial modern and cool, but my drink was really just gross unfortunately."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee place. Does espresso based drinks, siphon, cold brew, nitro, and pour over.  Roast their own coffee on site. Usually have 3 kinds of beans to choose from. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Dog friendly. The space is relatively big with many seats, but they do get busy."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Super hip and chill. Local art for display and sale on the walls. Right by the park. Cool.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Fast friendly service, modern spacious design and good place to work out of or meet a friend."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I liked the atmosphere and the pour over coffee was really good.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great cold brew, and an area to sit outside in the back!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The coffee is really good, and the crumb cake and morning glory tea cake are both yummy. I wish there were more tables, and the WiFi were time limited."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Really cool place. Siphons near the back wall are pretty
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Came in and got a siphon with a friend. Got the Ethiopian. Was terrific. Staff was so friendly, drinks were expertly prepared, the store is nice inside, the selection of coffees is great, and the location is also just kind of a nice place to be."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Pricey but some of the best coffee in the city
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,I haven't had better coffee anywhere in or out of the bay
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Simple, they just focus on making good coffee and a couple of cakes to accompany a good brew."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good coffee next to a whole foods.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good atmosphere,  a lot of space, good selection of coffe Beautiful barist female :-) good music, but it's just my opinion Wifree not excellent"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,One of my favorite coffee places
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,They have a very similar coffee cake to what Starbucks serves and it's soo good!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, couldn't get a cup at Safeway Ocean Beach, had to go into the Haight."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"It was a very nice place to have a brake after hanging in haight street. Peaceful place around Sunday workers and students. Lovely decoration natural and simple, even smells wood."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"By far my favorite coffee/tea place in the Haight-Ashbury area (and probably top 3 in the city). Their pastries are delicious, the coffee is fresh and tastes like real coffee, but the highlight to me is the hibiscus iced tea. Also, the place is very cool with some coffee grinders on the back. Well worth the experience."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Lots of seating, people on laptops working. Chill vibe, background music, high ceilings and roasting machines. Outdoor seating. Super friendly staff, got a free try on their nitro which is very acidic and strong. the americano was delicious."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Best place to grab a coffee before heading into Golden Gate Park
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice calm place, with cool photography, the cold brew is outstanding, probably the best I had in SF. Kudos Flywheel"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"This is the best coffee in the Haight without question. Combine that with free internet and enough power outlets to support the growing community of day workers in the neighborhood, this is where you'll find me on sunny days working."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Really good coffee, should try the “alternate” siphon coffee"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Super delish, rich cold brew! Service can be a bit scattered, hipster-time ;-)"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Modern, fabric style location. Great selection of coffee beans to choose from."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Loveee the decor and work space at this coffeeshop.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,My favorite coffee place.  AA Kenya pourover is intense and delicious.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Luv this place! Great coffee and amazing location, right by the park <3"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Strong coffee. Cold brew is a bit more bitter than expected but strong flavor.  Drip and mochas are also very good.  Very minimalist with not many food options. Several tables and wifi if you need a place to work.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Best coffee in the area, from cold brews through to espresso based drinks. A lot of space to chill and it's fine to take your laptop."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Did not have a toaster oven to warm up food they sell. 🤔 Pleasant Staff. …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,This does exactly what it says it does. A lovely place to rest your weary feet and take on food and drink at not to experience prices Plus if you are wandering around this part of town it has a very clean Restroom with baby changing facilities so this place might well be a godsend in this neighbourhood.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Becoming a regular here for a morning pour over
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great bold coffee and the crew is fantastic!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Service was nothing special but the cold brew was good
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Awesome and simplistic atmosphere. Amazing coffee!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice hipster coffee shop.  Allows pets as floor is cement.  Great location.  But a pound of coffee and latte is free
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The coffee cake was delicious I also had the drip coffee which was delicate and refined. The interior atmosphere is very nice, industrial."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Amazing brewed coffee / average muffins 7/10
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Love the lattes! Smaller pastry type food. Cute patio nestled in the back.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Exceptional macchiato! Great time catching up on latest family deets
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great place to chill out but can be busy and difficult to find a seat.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Best coffee shop in upper Haight
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Most consistently great coffee I've had anywhere. Never bitter, never over-brewed, they only do pour-overs, no drip coffee. Never boiling lava hot but also never lacking in heat, so it stays hot long enough. But you can ask for boiling lava hot if you want it. Nice tables and seating. Often nearly full but *always* at least two or three spots open even during peak weekend hours. Everyone goes there to drink coffee and work, so if you're a cafe rat like me who likes a working atmosphere this place is perfect for you. Not a ton of outlets, but they do exist so find your spots close to them if you need that. They don't serve food so they def want people to cycle through. I'm a regular so admittedly I probably don't leave as soon as they'd like, but make up for it by going very often O:) Impeccable design. Exposed wood beams with exposed metal giving it that industrial chic edge. Art lines the walls cleanly. Vaulted ceiling. Plenty of natural light with big windows at the front and small ones at the back. Probably not as much as the ideal but enough, and well-placed lighting makes up for any darker spots. Roasting machines in the back. Patio out back. People will leave you alone to work, but it's as social as you want it to be since everyone is so friendly. I chatted with one of the baristas every time I went and now he's a good friend! :)"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nothing special about this place, other than it is an independent coffee roasting company. Coffee is standard, and the pastries are good but can get heavy since they come in big portions.  I made the mistake of sitting out on their back patio, hoping to enjoy the sun. LIttle did I know that the back is covered like a greenhouse, making it unbearably hot! I would come back to get my caffeine fix, but that's it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great, unpretentious local coffee spot!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great cafe with good coffee.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,We visited the Flywheel Kiosk in GGP. The cappuccino was excellent and staff friendly. Will have to visit again.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Excellent coffee, fun and friendly staff, and open early."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,A fine place to stop for a cuppa and kill some time.  Wireless available for customers!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,First place we come when we travel to San Francisco. We dream about this coffee in San Antonio - it’s that good.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Coffee is always good l. Sometimes the music is too loud.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, friendly stuff"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Quality coffee and great staff
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Don’t miss their outdoor space across the street. Grab a coffee and sit in the park!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Reliably solid, relatively quiet third wave coffee shop."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Come for the amazing latte art - even in the hot chocolate! Stay for the chill vibe.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,The best coffee so far in SF
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,One of the best coffee places in SF
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Environment is nice and relaxing, nice open floor space and seems to be a great spot to read/work, etc.  I ordered a 3 shot latte and found out they only sell them in double increments. So by ordering a 3 shot latte they said they will just pour out the 4th shot of espresso. That’s wasteful and absolutely ridiculous first of all, secondly they charged me $9.00 (Nine dollars, not a typo) for it. I actually paused and asked myself why am I paying 9 dollars for bean water. The latte was good but why can’t they just charge for a single extra shot at a not insane price."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Exceptionally kind and attentive staff.  Never in my life have I visited a cafe and had the barista not only ask my name, but say goodbye Katie! When I left several hours later! Truly a pleasant and heartwarming surprise customer experience. As for food, they have several getting oatmeal selections (o had hazelnut cacao), cups to stay for those long laptop work sessions. Very ample airy space with a washed concrete & old-fashioned lightbulb aesthetic. I'm sad I'm only in town visiting, if I weren't this would be a regular hangout!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, comfortable interior."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great place to sit and enjoy your coffee
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, good music and Free wifi."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,No wifi. Not an organized place. Looks more like a factory. Too noisy
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Always reliable buzz. Good vibes. Friendly folks.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Nice decor and great tasting coffee. I tried Ethiopian siphon. Parking is a bit tough but that's expected in the neighborhood.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great that it’s just across the street from Golden Gate Park.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Idk how but their coffee is really bad.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,One of our favourite things in a new city is finding quality coffee.  Flywheel Coffee Roasters offer Siphon coffee so I had the Ethiopian brew. Beautifully presented it had great aroma and flavours.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee shop and roaster
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"If i'm giving you $4 for a 12 ounce cup of coffee before tipping, you should have more than one working employee, so i don't have to wait 15 minutes while a wench and your one employee chat about the pastry case.   lame."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Amazing coffee and service ☕
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"On my first visit, I thought this was a 4.0/4.5 star place. But on subsequent trips, my opinion of the place has slipped.  Granted, it's beautiful inside. Everything is gorgeous. Even the patrons are cute. I hate to say it, but it makes most every other Haight coffeehouse look like the rat traps they are.  That said, the air inside is consistently still and muggy and ten degrees too warm, often physically uncomfortable. It's one reason I rarely stay past 45 minutes, but I suppose this is by design: Make your customers uncomfortable and they won't lounge around too long.  Minus two stars.  The seating is uncomfortable. Stools are terrible for the back.  A few tables have standard chairs with backs and armrests;  these are sturdy and very comfortable, but there are too few of them. Minus half a star.  The enclosed back patio is great in theory: I can enjoy my coffee outside, but without any hobos bothering me!  And it's dog friendly! Unfortunately, the clear plastic roof lets in ALL of the sunlight; the solid planks enclosing the space on all sides prevents all breeze.  With the exceptional heat and zero shade, it would be an exceptional place to grow tomatoes but it's a terrible place to read your email.  The longest I could ever last out there was ten minutes before I gave up and went back inside. Bonus: the wifi won't reach out to the patio. Get it together, guys! Give us at least one patch of shade back there. Replace the planks with chain link or bars so we can get some breeze going through.  Minus half a star.  Douchebaggery-Factor: this place has it in spades. Flywheel tends to pull in quite a few of the bearded-hat-wearing hipster-types from the Whole Foods next door. I'm tempted to deduct half a star for this, but it's not like they can help it.  All in all, this is a lovely addition to the neighborhood, but it has a LOT of issues. Fix the temperature issue and I'll reconsider my score."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"If there is one advantage that stood out from all other cool sf roasters, it’s the space, plenty of them."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Barristas are super friendly. If you want some more privacy while you're there head to the back where you'll find a quite little patio usually all to your self.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Good place to have coffee!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,$4 for the best iced latte I’ve ever had. Large quantity too.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Service was horrible. Coffee was good. My, not so experienced coffee drinking friend was paying for this round so I let him order for us (which was my bad).  The cashier/barista was a young guy that was very pretentious and not helpful at all. Quite belittling too. My buddy ordered 2 drip coffees, not aware they offered multiple roasts. The cashier shot us a look and asked, ""weeeell, which one?!"" then glanced at some mason jars on the counter.  Upon receiving our coffee my friend asked for whole milk (of which was sour) and cinnamon. The jerk barista (same one that rung us up) said, ""Psh, we don't have cinnamon, we're purists like that...""  OK. Be purists if you want. I get it. I'm down with 3rd wave. But not everyone knows. Not everyone is educated on it and it's significance...so kindly, educate them. Don't belittle them.  First and last time I'm going here."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Flywheel is like an Instagram coffee place. It's very aesthetic and pretty on the surface but the coffee is burnt and the bathroom is janky. Lots of flair, not a lot of substance."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Serious coffee. Afficianados will love it. Single origins roasted on premises. Siphon, pourover, cold brew, and espresso. Top notch"

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, vibe, decor, location, pricing, and wi-fi.  If a star is awarded per requirement, looks like I went over.  As a bonus, the owner is a down-to-earth Guatemalan that knows the growers that he gets his beans from.  They're not square if you bring a snack from Whole Foods next door, either.  My favorite cafe in the city :^)"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Great spot! Staff could be nicer for foreigners!

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Nice banana walnut bread, only gripe is that they didn’t have an oven or toaster to heat it up, so you have to have it cold.  Coffee was good, atmosphere is nice to just chill out for a lazy morning breakfast."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"The atmosphere of Flywheel is very attractive and enjoyable. The music was not too loud and good for studying/working.  The coffee was very bad. My wife and I ordered two pour overs and were incredibly let down. It was over extracted. The coffee was over roasted. For $4 a pop, the pour overs are not worth your time.  The menu makes it look like Flywheel is a third wave shop, but it is most definitely a second wave shop trying to appeal to third wavers."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,Fav coffee shop in the city!

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"Requested a Vienna. Staff were unfamiliar with this coffee. I described it. They said they could make it.

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"This is my weekend go-to! Every Saturday starts with an Ethiopian pour-over and a Morning Glory muffin. While pour-overs are the main attraction here, you've also got a full selection of espresso specialties. The staff here are always happy and helpful, even during the morning rush when there's a bit of a line. The space at Flywheel is perfect for plugging in and getting some work done, or just enjoying a book with your coffee. Don't forget to check out the local artwork on the walls!"
