CoffeeSmith,"Very cute place, Philz was backed up so I popped in here. Greeted by the lady and eyes fell on the rows of gleaming Chinese baos . Asked for a regular cup of black coffee with shot of espresso and a bbq bao. There is a 5$ min for credit card use. Great cup of coffee, fresh and strong and the bao hit the spot. Would definitely come here again."
