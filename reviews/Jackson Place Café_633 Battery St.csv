Jackson Place Café,Cutest little European cafe with delicious cappuccinos and paninis. Family-owned. A little quiet nest amidst the bustle of the FiDi.
Jackson Place Café,"A small secluded café and chill spot in the middle of San Francisco, perfect for some time off.  The selections are pretty limited; mostly soups, pastries and sandwiches, as well as some fruits and salads. But boy, are they good!  I had a breakfast panini and a cortado coffee, and while the food was great, coupled with the rustic ambience and cozy vibes, it made for a wonderful meal.  Great place for a chill brunch stop!"
Jackson Place Café,"I cannot speak to the food or the coffee or the service as surprisingly they close both early and all day on Friday. So…double check their hours before heading over.  You could not imagine a more quaint location, tucked into the courtyard of a building under a canopy of trees. This is the spot where you want to meet for coffee and love it so much you order a second one.  Sadly I didn’t even have one, but I will be back!"
Jackson Place Café,"Great oasis in the Jackson Square area, great cappuccino and sandwiches !  Love the atmosphere and intimacy."
Jackson Place Café,"The paninis were delicious and they serve Sightglass coffee. The nestled, outdoor environs added a palpable charm, though take note that there isn't any WiFi (still a great place if you can tether/don't need Internet). Hope to go back soon!"

Jackson Place Café,"Nice spot for coffee in Jackson Square. There are several coffee shops in the area, but none have the ambiance of this cafe, which is essentially a coffee kiosk with outdoor seating nestled in an brick building alley way. They use Sightclass coffee serve a great cafe au lait and mocha, which is made with Guittard chocolate so it's a nice treat."
