The Mill,"We had Avocado Toast and lemon ricotta toast. It is self-service. When we arrived at 9 AM, there was a long queue. The wait was fortunately not long. My toast was ok, a bit too hard for me and definitely not worth the price. The tables were not clean. Cheap knife that hardly cut through the hard crust of my toast. My latte was good."
The Mill,"Took a pizza cooking class here today. It was a lot of fun. Great environment and people, and we learned a few things about cooking pizza along the way. Had some expresso and enjoyed the coffee shop before the class. The bread here is amazing. They mill their own fluor and bake their own bread daily. Will definitely be back."
The Mill,"Wonderful service, delicious, freshly brewed coffee and garlic toast with an egg 🍳 simply placed in the middle, yum!! Add to that pleasant conversations with strangers who love their pets, your family, or friends and well you found yourself a perfect little breakfast joint. #enjoy and when you bite into that toast or drink that oh so yummy coffee don’t forget to stop and thank me 🤭☺️"
The Mill,I really enjoyed my visit. The place smells like freshly made bread with many selections such as sourdough and rye bread. The service is also fairly fast depending on the time. When I went it was very busy due to a public holiday.
The Mill,"great brunch spot with light meals and known for their toast. the lines, although long on weekends, go by pretty quickly but seating is hard to come by. would go again but not the top of my list.  they use neighbor bakehouse pastries and four barrel coffee!  smoked trout toast: layers of flavor in each ingredient, toast is a little too hard though. would recommend!"
The Mill,"This is a really nice place to meet up with friends for breakfast or brunch. It has a nice vibe. They do various different “Toasts.” Which is fun.  Everything has a really healthy taste and vibe. You can also buy fresh bread.  I tried the Smoked Trout Toast. Their in-house crème fraîche is really yummy, and the toast presentation was good. The dish was good - I just felt like it could have been better.  I also had a hot chocolate, however, it tasted more like a hot cocoa."
The Mill,Great artisnal bakery with a delicious selection of toast & toppings for brunch. The loafs of bread are divine and feature a special bread of the week.
The Mill,I was here last in the Before Times. I felt like changing things up and checking it out again.  It's as fantastic as I remember it. I had the avocado mash toast and it was absolutely delicious. I love the atmosphere. There's a parklet outside and they have for here mugs and dishes.  I made it a point to go early because I know it gets really busy and it was already filling up
The Mill,A bit crowded for a Sunday morning! The line went out of the door. But their coffee was really good. I also liked the avocado toast.
The Mill,You cant go wrong with this place!Definitely recommend Avocado Mash served over a nice thick slice of toast drizzled with what looked like EVOO and a light sprinkle of salt. It was delicious. We gambled with willing to missing our flight in order to stop by here and have another the next day (we made it SFO on time). Their Cinnamon sugar toast was good too. I usually like my coffee with milk and sugar but glad I didn't add anything to my Latte. It was rich and smooth! This is a MUST VISIT place and its right around the corner from The Painted Ladies.
The Mill,"Amazing bread, toasts are all to die for, awesome espresso drinks. Can be a bit of a wait and battle for a seat but makes for an overall enjoyable and social experience. I got a cortado with oat and it was perfection!"
The Mill,I love coming to the mill. It is spacious and stylish and a great spot to watch people. The coffee is phenomenal. The bread is even better although quite pricey. ♥️this spot.
The Mill,"Great spot for gourmet toast and coffee on Divisadero. Eat in with the cool kids at the communal table, grab a little bistro table, or enjoy outside (Painted Ladies in Alamo Square are just a couple blocks away). You can also pick up a loaf of bread for take away."
The Mill,"Great vibe, really great breads from Josey the bread baker and lots of pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse.  The staff taking orders are always friendly.  We did bring our own coffee mugs, and the person taking our order was super nice about it and even gave an generous pour.  I’m recently gluten free and was pleasantly surprised to find out all the toast combos can be made on GF bread. I was a bit disappointed once I picked up my order to see that the GF bread options was quite a bit smaller than the standard bread options for all toasts. Wakes up to the pick up counter area and saw the contrast between my slice and several others.  It’s great to have a GF option and I appreciate it being available. That slice was super fresh but very dense, lots of nuts and seeds and while it was soft felt more like a seed thick cracker, than a slice of traditional the mill, soft, fluffy bread.  I’ll definitely be back and want to try the ricotta toast but will probably try a different GF options next time."
The Mill,This is a great spot to grab a coffee / snack and meet up with a friend. They have fresh bread and other baked goods for purchase as well as pantry items like olive oil and wines from local sellers. I highly recommend The Mill!
The Mill,"We visited The Mill for brunch and had a positive experience. It wasn’t too busy, so we were able to find a table by the window after we placed our order. We ordered a coffee and latte with an avocado mash toast and a cinnamon sugar toast. Both of the toasts were delicious. The bread was thick and tasted great. The staff was friendly and the inside of the store was clean. I would love to visit again and try some of the other items."
The Mill,"A baker recommended this place to me - not for the ambiance, or coffee, or pastries (all of which are stellar). But for the quality of the bread which is absolutely top tier.  You can buy slices at the Mill, but the best way to experience it by far is to buy a loaf to take home (recommend the standard Country loaf or Seed Feast). You can garnish it with quality butter, jam, avocados, lox, almond butter, etc. You’ll get a ton of bang for your buck and the quality is unbelievable. Josey Baker is a legend among bread bakers and it makes sense why."
The Mill,I love the simplicity of this brunch spot! It’s literally just different toast flavours and combination. I got eggs on garlic toast and it was delicious.
The Mill,"The Mill is a very cute local coffee shop. I really liked the atmosphere on envibe app and decided to check it out! It is quite small cafe near Alamo Square park, but it feels like all the locals go there. Would recommend to check it out on weekend morning!:)"
The Mill,Best whole wheat sourdough you’ll ever have! Also took their pizza making class which I highly recommend. Can get a bit busy in the weekends which isn’t surprising for a great spot like this.
The Mill,My daughter took me to The Mill a few days ago. We went back today. They carry Josey Baker Bread as well as an array of delicious pastries. I'm hooked on the Plum Pistachio Crumb Cake.  They make a nice oat milk cappuccino too. The ambience of the restaurant is warm and welcoming.
The Mill,"This breakfast place has great coffee and pastries. I loved the pistachio croissant, totally worth a try! They would run out of the bakery items though so early morning is a good time to go. They don't have a lot of seating compared to the crowd so plan accordingly. The toasts are good too but I like the bakery better"
The Mill,Fantastic latte and the cinnamon sugar toast is so simple but truly delicious. Love the decor and atmosphere
The Mill,"This was the best bread I've ever had. Had the avocado toast and the cinnamon sugar toast along with an americano, all so good. The vibe is cool, really great art hung up on the walls, and the prices are good."
The Mill,I was recommended this cafe because of their bread and it lived up to expectations! We loved the avocado toast. The bread looks huge but it's actually the perfect size because you can taste the bread itself. We also picked up an everything croissant and a seasonal pistachio and blackberry croissant and both were buttery and delicious.
The Mill,"We visited the Mill on a Tuesday and really liked the coffee, service and the ambience! It’s really spacious and seems ideal for coffeeshop working. They also had lots of great looking bread loaves and toasts we want to come back to try."
The Mill,"I absolutely love The Mill. Yes, the lines are long. Yes, it is worth it. Both the coffee and the toasts are totally delicious. The wonderful tartness of the sourdough-based breads is a unique delight. The coffee and espresso are smooth yet complex. Round and bold cold brew. And the staff are professional and efficient but somehow retain a degree of warmth and welcoming hospitality. Also, they are adorable. Get the raised vanilla donut and, heck, the vegan chocolate while you're at it--take those to-go, because you'll want to order the cinnamon toast, avocado toast, and egg in a hole. I love this place so much that I usually book a hotel or airbnb within walking distance when I visit the Bay. I'm obsessed."
The Mill,A place where a single piece of toast is delicious!
The Mill,"I ordered the Avocado Toast and Smoked Trout. The avocado toast was yummy, a little oily. The bread was good. The smoked trout was really good.. I wish it was served on a larger piece of toast it was small. I had to wait about 15 mins to receive my order. Overall, both were good and moderately well priced. I'd recommend stopping here for breakfast or lunch."
The Mill,"I ordered the Americano... Espresso Coffee is OK... Good not great.  But they serve almond milk as an alternative to regular milk.  Breads look good but somewhat overpriced.  I was listening to a customer ask an associate about the taste of rye. That customer had too much time on her hands. And let's just say, the associate was not very knowledgeable. This place is cool with local works of art.  Attracts a very hipster crowd that likes to sit, enjoy coffee and with their good companions."
The Mill,"Love the toast here. It’s famous for its bread, which means the toast is delicious but comes at a premium $$$ hot chocolate & latte are both incredible too. Go early to beat the rush lines can be around the block in peak hours."
The Mill,Gorgeous space with amazing toast. I got the almond butter toast and it was incredible. Communal tables inside and outside. Coffee was really good too.
The Mill,"Bar none the best bread in the city, maybe the best bread in the world. It’s just so damn good, if you haven’t tried it before, what are you waiting for?  My favorite has to be the Wonder Bread, I think it’s got to be the square shape. When the Wonder Bread’s sold out, the Country is usually my second choice.  Any of the breads that you get in store are also great."
The Mill,Best coffee and breakfast at a coffee shop.  Their hand baked artisan on-site bakery is incredible.  We loved their trout toast and egg in a hole.  Their croissants and pain au chocolates are perfectly flaky and flavorful.  The line moves quickly and they are customer centric.
The Mill,Truly the best piece of bread I’ve ever had. I ordered the ricotta toast and it was perfection. The crumb texture and taste of the bread was honestly life changing. I wish I lived closer so I could buy it more often.
The Mill,Love coming here to grab a loaf of bread for the week. Their baked goods are pretty tasty also.  The line may look long but it goes by quickly by their fast service.
The Mill,"Fav breakfast in SF. We were lucky to find a spot in the shared table. Coffee and treats were great, the staff very friendly. Ned a Mill close to me 🤍highly recommended"
The Mill,"Great place for toast lovers. The bread is fantastic and the options for toast are far reaching. The place is open and a bit loud however you can easily have a conversation with the person across from you. There are small tables lining the walls with ponger tables in the middle. Also a small outdoor bench section in front. The coffee is good (four barrel). I certainly enjoyed the mocha. There were few power outlets so I do not think this would be an easy place to work on a computer. Overall, great spot for some food and coffee."
The Mill,This place is dog-friendly. A nice place to post up with a laptop for an hour and seek funding for your startup.
The Mill,Wow! We stopped in and grabbed some toasts and Parmesan black pepper bun and blackberry pistachio croissant. The bun and croissant were insanely delicious. The bread used for the toast was super yummy.
The Mill,"Pretty interesting place for breakfast! Their coffees are awesome! The toast style breakfast are very delicious! Portions are pretty small! You can get two different toasts to try a variety! Their breads are awesome as well! Price can be high imo. Don’t get the cinnamon toast! It is a fat toast with tons of brown sugar and cinnamon! Not a great choice! Also, the place is packed so good luck finding a place to sit lol!"
The Mill,"Omg how did I not discover this place sooner??? Especially since my nail salon is 3 blocks away. First of all can it get better than Four Barrel Coffee AND a bakery in one? I ordered the most delicious cappuccino and they don’t use Clover brand milk! I also had the most incredible Earl Grey Olive Oil cake. My favorite thing I ordered 2 days in a row was the Almond Butter Toast on their wheat toast that it came with. Thanks to the most incredible gal that rung me up, Michelle, she told me how incredible the toast is and how fresh and warm and toasty on the outside that I couldn’t resist. She also suggested drizzling honey and she was on point. She was a gem and brightened my day. The place is usually packed especially on weekends. They are constantly making fresh bread and you can see it over the counter. They also play their music from a record player! Love love this place!"
The Mill,"I’ve been to The Mill dozens of times for coffee, toast or pastries. I think it is one of the best coffee shops in San Francisco. The ambiance combined with the tastiness of the treats makes every visit pleasurable. I especially love the cinnamon sugar toast. This is a great place to work from for several hours or to meet a friend. I could not recommend the Mill enough. My only complaint is that it can get crowders during the day, making it difficult to find a place to sit."
The Mill,"Great ambience and their bread and pastries looked amazing! Willing to come back to try these. I only stopped by for some coffee, but it was the worst one i’ve ever had before because of how bitter it was. If you like bitter coffee then this place is for you, otherwise would just go elsewhere. Their latte art is nice though."
The Mill,"When I checked menu, I can't believe they charged $4- $8 for a toast. But it was really great and special, coffee was good as well. Love the decorations here."
The Mill,"The Mill is my favorite coffee shop in SF. The atmosphere is always so inviting and cozy. The coffee is always fresh and delicious, they also have a great selection of pastries and breads. The only downside is the seating is limited, so I have to order to-go or stand around until a seat becomes available. Overall I highly recommend checking it out."
The Mill,"I went following a Google Maps suggestion and while for the most part it was ""ok"", I expected more from a cafe with such a long line!, which means you need to wait a while to order, even if it is for takeout. The place is beautiful, nice industrial retro style. The amount of options is more limited than I expected, very specific menu and prices are far from cheap. I ordered a muffin and it was truly delicious, but it was so small that I felt like missing some bites, specially for the price. I also got a croissant which was good, mostly because you could tell it was quite fresh, yet it was not memorable. And I got a a hot chocolate and that was disappointing, average would almost be a an understatement, they need to up their game in that field. The 4 stars are for the muffin, the -1 for the chocolate."
The Mill,Just lost my mind after having egg in a hole with sage garlic butter with a side of avocado . Ooohhhh myyyy goooood🤩🤩 …
The Mill,"The best toast you will ever have. Beautiful breads, tasty locally sourced toppings and wonderful coffee. A beautiful space it's a great place to sit and enjoy the best toast you've ever had."
The Mill,"My friend told me I couldn't go to San Fran without going the The Mill and having one of their toasts... So I did just that, and I regret nothing!! I'm not the type of person to usually order a toast when I eat out, but this one was so gooooood. Their bread is so fresh and good. The mix of almond butter + butter + sea salt is amazingly savoury, yet so simple to recreate at home!"
The Mill,"Bread is exceptional, but I always just grab and go. Have never stayed to eat because the noise level inside is absolutely insane, to the point where it's probably an occupational hazard for the employees."
The Mill,Really tasty toasts and cappuccino! Worth the money! It’s really pleasant to find a place in the city with such a quality of bread and ingredients.
The Mill,"great place, good coffee and the avocado toast is amazing. I enjoy having breakfast here, and it’s also a good spot to work. staff are great."
The Mill,Poor choice of food and milk for the coffee. Small and quite pricey portions. Staff could be more friendly and I had an impression that I’m an intruder there. There is a lot of space for work and study but forget about Wi-Fi... There are way nicer places in the neighborhood.
The Mill,"Fantastic place to enjoy breakfast and immerse in SF lifestyle. Great interior, great food, great vibe, and most important great staff 💯😍 …"
The Mill,"I thought the coffee was decent, they ran out of vanilla flavoring by the time I got there but I would say it was decent. We also grabbed a mushroom and cheese filling pastry and it’s not as tempting cold, they’re not allowed to warm things up for you but it’s conveniently located next to the painted ladies block."
The Mill,"One of my go-to cafés. The coffee and pastries are amazing, and all the bread/toast are to die for! The ambiance and indoor decor are super great. Amazing vibe!"
The Mill,Beautiful coffee shop in a convenient location. Double shot of espresso was delicious and my wife loved her tea. Will definitely visit again!
The Mill,Best espresso I have ever had here in SF the bread 🍞 is so good you wont go wrong with smashed avocado and almond toast.
The Mill,"My favorite local coffee shop. It has great design/vibe, everyone who works there is friendly, and their toasts are delicious. Not to mention good espresso, as well as delicious bread made in-house, that's also for sale by the loaf. At night they switch to pizza and booze, so it's great for all times of day. Always super full so it's hard to find seating, but the outdoor public parklet helps. Cannot recommend enough."
The Mill,Favourite coffee shop in the city. Incredible poppyseed walnut babka and avocado toast. 😍
The Mill,Great place to have coffee while in the area! Garlic Knot was amazing. The coffee also tasted good. The atmosphere is extremely good. The music was nice!
The Mill,Great place to grab a quick bite and coffee
The Mill,"Sounds odd for something as simple as toast to be brilliantly addicting but it just is!  With a wide variety of freshly made roasts, coffees, and a lot of sitting area in a friendly and cool environment, The Mill meets all your hipster & family needs.  A classic tradition when I visit, Mahalos 🤙 Only downside is the crowds and the prices"
The Mill,"Loved everything: the food, avo toast and the pastries, and the coffee. Nice to sit and observe/chat with the people around you."
The Mill,very good pastries (best ones I've had in the bay). beautiful space. gets noisy. their coffe is not as good.
The Mill,"Best toasts in SF! I had the avocado one and the pesto pine nuts and both were amazing! Also, the coffee at this place is really good! Nice location and setup, feels spacious and welcoming!"
The Mill,"Great spot for a cup of coffee and a delicious piece of homemade toast baked in house. Yes it's pricey, but what place isn't here in the city? This place gets super crowded around 10, so get here earlier to avoid a longer line. Nice friendly staff."
The Mill,"We got the lemon ricotta + jam on the dark rye. The toast was good overall but one thing I wanted to note was that the guy who was making the toast was not wearing any gloves and kept touching his mask, clothes, other stuffs on his kitchen table then back on making the toast with bare hands without not washing his hands. Tbh I was a bit shocked watching that so couldn’t finish our toast. It just feels very unhygienic during this covid period…"
The Mill,Omg! Here provides good coffee! I would like latte with oat milk! ! ! Nice environment and pleasure bakery smell~~~ the price is reasonable! Super recommend here!
The Mill,"This place always has a long line, even in the COVID-19 pandemic! I didn’t understand, but I finally tried the bread for myself, and now I get it. The country loaf that I bought was so fresh and one of the most delicious breads I’ve ever had. The coffee and toast is also good but really the main attraction is the BREAD 😋🍞 …"
The Mill,"Love this chill coffee shop and always visit when in town. They offer pastries and toasts, and sell fresh bread and a few other items. Communal seating and a few benches get very busy, but usually if you wait, one will open up."
The Mill,Hands down my favorite coffee shop in the city. Incredible hand made fresh toast with various toppings. Coffee is made to order and always beautifully presented. I love the bright atmosphere with the public seating outside.
The Mill,"Great Cafe, delicious bread, delicious toast. I never thought I would consider 9 bucks for avocado toast worth it but it totally is."
The Mill,"This toast is worth every dime! So good! The cinnamon sugar is the perfect mix of buttery, sweet, and salty. Excellent with their coffee"
The Mill,Usual good coffee and baked goods combination in a usual SF hipster set up. In a good way though. You will not be disappointed.
The Mill,Great place to visit and have a cup of coffee. The avocado toast is a must. Their coffee is from Four Barrel roasters.
The Mill,Josey Baker knows how to bake bread! I ordered the smoked trout on whole grain bread -- and it was freaking delicious! Very cool spot and friendly service.
The Mill,"Nice space and delicious bread! Got the hazelnut chocolate toast—  it’s a bit on the pricey side but it’s SF. I’ll definitely be back to buy a loaf, they have a great selection of bread."
The Mill,Excellent neighborhood coffee shop with fresh bread. Communal tables and personal ones. The adventure bread is delicious. They have some ceramics for sale. Go for pizza night too. They have an awesome parklet and bike parking too.
The Mill,"A baker recommended this  - not for the ambiance, or coffee, or pastries (all of which are stellar). But for the quality of the bread which is absolutely top tier.  You can buy slices at the Mill, but the best way to experience it by far is to buy a loaf to take home (recommend the standard Country loaf or Seed Feast). You can garnish it with quality butter, jam, avocados, lox, almond butter, etc. You’ll get a ton of bang for your buck and the quality is unbelievable. Josey Baker is a legend among bread bakers."
The Mill,"omg this just made my day, thank you Sarah Jacobs, YOU are a legend too :) love, Josey"
The Mill,Been going here for over a decade and the service and quality are consistently good! Grab your coffee and food to-go and take a walk around Alamo Square Park a short block away.
The Mill,Best bread in the city if you are looking for clean and honest bread. Jose is one of the few places making 100% rye bread. Pair that with four barrel coffee and you got the perfect spot. But people know so it is quite busy :)
The Mill,"The homemade breads, foods, coffees, and ambience are incredible. I can't believe anyone would give this place less than 5 stars. One block from painted ladies."
The Mill,"Bought a loaf of bread and croissant - bread top notch, has to be top five in city. Croissant was okay maybe try the other pastries instead."
The Mill,"The Mill is a beautiful light-filled coffee shop with amazing coffee and toast. It’s a beautiful vibe. Coffees are a bit pricy at $6+ for an Almond Latte, but I still go out of my way to visit on every trip! It’s an experience. I do miss their Atelier Dion ceramic mugs - but nonetheless, it’s a great spot! A must try!"
The Mill,"Good service, nice little Cafe with good ambience. There is some outdoor seating as well. Overall I loved the experience and would definitely comeback again. Could get crowded sometimes so be ready for little wait, and I would recommend to try cinnamon sugar toast with seat salt it was the best I had like 3 when I tried it for the first time."
The Mill,"The almond milk Cappuccino cost $5.50..and it was just okay. I found the coffee not to only be over priced but also not any too great. Donuts we're good, but $15+ for 2 donuts and coffee it's a bit steep. I'd rather go to Pinhole in Bernal heights."
The Mill,"The toasts are amazing, my favorite is the Hummus Toast. They make their own bread fresh, and it shows in the toast. The coffee is good as well, and it is a pleasant setting. They don’t have WiFi or power outlets, so if you’re planning to work there, go prepared. Also, it can be slightly windy even inside the cafe, so carry a jacket, even in summer."
The Mill,"Extremely delicious pastries, especially pistachio and everything croissants. Coffee is above 5 stars. The bread is so good! Adrian is the mood setter for the place. This breakfast and service made my day!"
The Mill,"They are very generous with their ingredients -- chunky pieces of bread with heaping mounds of avocado, almond butter, trout, or whatever choice of toast you make. The brown rye with seasonal jam is the most petite but the flavor is still RICH. They also have a wide selection of pastries that are unlike any other in the city, such as the earl grey olive oil cake or the Mexican cookies. Just wow."
The Mill,Pine nuts tart. THIS IS MAGIC!!! Absolute must!
The Mill,They have hemp mylk as a milk alternative. Great coffee and space.
The Mill,"The pistachio+blackberry croissant is so amazing, they run out quick so you need to get there before 10 am to find it. The levain bread loaf is also the best bread I have eaten in the area."
The Mill,"Loved the coffee and spacious chill vibe. No Wi-Fi, adding to the character of the cafe."
The Mill,My favorite fancy toast ( that tastes amazing) and coffee shop. I've known the mill since it was a little snack in 2012 - it's always a delight with seasonal surprises
The Mill,I’ve been coming here since it opened. It’s special and high quality. But I do think the pizza slices take way too long to be ready! Just seems like lots of pizza is sitting back there ready to be served and the servers are taking their sweet time. Especially slices to go.
The Mill,Probably the best bread in the city! And the coffee is great too.
The Mill,"A great cafe to get some work done! I love the aesthetic of the cafe, but the toast is overpriced IMO and the lack of outlets and seats is why I would give it three stars overall.  I love the bread and coffee and would come back if I wanted to find a place to read a book or do a little work, but definitely going to come earlier to make sure I can get a seat."
The Mill,"Really lame that they don’t do drip coffee refills, drip coffee is almost $5… Sightglass always refills unlimited"
The Mill,"The good: excellent baked goods (parmesan peppercorn bun is my favorite) and coffee. Lovely, airy space with great design and plenty of natural light, records often playing. Customers are fancy city folks, excellent people watching.  The bad: it's expensive and pretentious. I get that they have Divisadero rent to pay. I was willing to overlook it for several years. But after the 3rd out-of-town houseguest I suggested The Mill to returned with comments about the pretentiousness they experienced, generally in regard to the service, I figured it's time to admit it. Perhaps it has gotten better; the last guest described the service this way a few months ago and I know good help is hard to find in a tight labor market. The consistency of the feedback was undeniable though.  There are other bakeries and cafes nearby."
The Mill,"Toast is toast. But at The Mill they have a direct line to Jesus’ personal collection of loaves. You can’t fathom how good their coffee, food and atmosphere are. Is it possible to give coffee shops Michelin stars? Shout out to Anna for giving an amazing dealers choice."
The Mill,Cute coffee place. Best for groups. It’s an amazing bakery. Loved the loaf.
The Mill,A can't-miss SF food experience! Don't leave the city without getting the cinnamon sugar toast. Absolutely incredible freshly-baked bread with an authentic SF atmosphere.
The Mill,"Yes. This is a 5 star place. Vibe, service, drinks, and food are all worth it."
The Mill,"Very laid back, spacious and good lighting. The coffee and croissants are wonderful. The toasts were decent. I'm more likely to come back for the ambience and the coffee."
The Mill,"My wife and I stopped in for a quick piece of toast and coffee before heading off to Dolores Park. Gotta say, we felt very much in the company of locals and the food was awesome and quick. Must stop if your in the area and need a quick delicious bite while feeling like a local."
The Mill,I never order a salad anywhere basically but I decided to try it here. I got the “Big Salad” and it was super filling. My friend got the beets veggie pizza which also looked delicious. I think I’ll be back here again soon. Apparently their pizza changes every single week.
The Mill,"The best toast and such amazing coffee! I lived in SF for a few months and dream about this place between visits. It is a little expensive for toast, but not expensive when you consider that it is the best toast in the world."
The Mill,Spacious coffee shop serving Four Barrel coffee. The place is fronted by large windows and gets a lot of light. The latte I had here was very nicely made. Seating indoor is available at a few individual tables as well as a large communal table. Lines can be long.
The Mill,"The croissant that I got was amazing, delicious and I’d order another one in a split second. The chocolate chip cookie was okay, very small for the price and tasted too dry, it crumbled when I took a bite.  The real nose dive was the coffee, I ordered a mocha and the espresso tasted burnt. I could taste a deep burn flavor and it made it undrinkable. I had to throw it away. I would have asked for a remake but I had already left and was too far away to go back. Maybe it was the oat milk that they over steamed, if that’s possible, but it bad. And for a $6.50 I’d expect much better quality. Every few coffees the baristas should taste the coffee to make sure it’s good.  I’d only return for the pastries but definitely not the coffee."
The Mill,"The cappuccino is unbelievably good and the bread is a dream for a European. The best breakfast spot! And also great pottery, which you can buy there."
The Mill,Really cute coffee shop. They make their own bread and other baked goods. You can get a slice of toast with different spreads such as pumpkin. This place is very pricey for what your getting and they don’t provide WiFi.
The Mill,"The vibe, coffee, music was great. But I can't give past 2 stars when I find pubic hair half way through my cinnamon knot dessert :("
The Mill,What an amazing coffee shop. Smoked trout toasts were amazing. But even better - pistachio blueberry croissant - priceless! Thank you so much for such a great experience!
The Mill,"I went in the morning. It was super busy. That is not a bad thing. I did not wait too long. I bought the country bread, a mocha, and there version of a coffee cake.  The country bread was delicious. It is like a wheat sourdough bread that is bumped up a notch. I would buy it again. It’s great with a garlic spread.  Their version of a coffee cake was excellent. It was light, moist, and just the right sweetness to it. I recommend it.  The mocha on the other hand, was a disappointment. It tasted more like a latte than mocha. It was bitter with no taste of chocolate to it. I recommend that they put more chocolate in it to counter the bitterness.  The service was good. They were helpful. Overall, a good place to go."
The Mill,"Monday Pizza is pretty good, recommended if the wait is not too bad"
The Mill,"I just ate a loaf of bread for breakfast, and I have no regrets. Truly outstanding bread. I got some kind of loaf with black pepper and parmesan in it, and it might be my favorite thing ever."
The Mill,"Poster child of a true coffee shop. Simple menu, fresh ingredients, open space...clatter of dishes echo through the backgrounds of chatter & ease. I sat & watched a barista engaged in his craft with such attention. Another prepping loafs of delicious goodness set on the shelving. I fell in love. The ambience, the free spirit of every individual behind the counter. The epitome of coolness."
The Mill,If you visit this area stop here for a coffee! Real espresso’s in light stylish bistrot/ bar setting.
The Mill,"Old fashioned coffee shop with no WiFi, no reservations, and no non-service dogs allowed. Just the most inventive treats to go along with their standard coffees menu. We went for the Trout on Toast and the Egg in the Hole."
The Mill,Delicious bread with toppings options served up with their delicious coffee. It is a busy place but for a reason.
The Mill,"Coffee is excellent, but it's worth coming just for the fresh baked bread smell."
The Mill,A really chill place. Love the design and the sunshine through the roof and windows!
The Mill,"Pretentious. There's not enough seating, no outlets, and no Wifi. Very clear they don't want you to hang out for very long. It was  $10 for 1 egg in a slice of bread. Kind of silly, won't come back."
The Mill,Love their lattes and toast.
The Mill,Nice quiet space with lots of room and fresh air! Good house coffee… nice porch!
The Mill,Always looking out for vibes in a coffee place. And what a lovely place this was. Sat by large windows to enjoy a latte.
The Mill,"Great space, no WiFi, friendly staff, coffee was a bit disappointing. (4/5 green stars) Hmmmm. Everyone in here looks like a model – I’m wondering what’s going on. Perhaps I’m just not used to spending Saturday afternoon in a swanky SF hood.  Or maybe it’s the prices – a slice of toast with cream cheese was $3.75 in 2014 and today it’s $7 (although it now contains pesto and pine nuts). I’ve no specific problem with them charging as much as they like if they use good ingredients – just be aware of the price before you drool too much over the toast photos. The main attractions are the space, and that it’s a collaboration between Josey Baker Bread and Four Barrel Coffee.  You know about the toast already, so I won’t go into it ;-)  I had a straight up coffee ($3.50) and thought it was a bit lackluster to be honest. Disappointingly, they don’t do pour-overs and my coffee tasted like it had been there a while. Also weird that it seemed a little over-roasted and bitter, considering that they don’t do dark roasts. It’s still a little better than average coffee – it’s just that I have high expectations because of the reputation. They just got new coffee mugs – beautiful stoneware made locally by Sven Ceramics. The space is very pretty - nicely laid out with individual tables, a long communal table, and lots of floor space. Good music playing too. No WiFi but it’s still a place where you can hang out with a book or laptop and not feel like an oddball.  I’m also giving them 4/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact based on these reasons:  Positives: • Four Barrel recently switched to compostable coffee bags. • Bread is made from organic grain, often local. • On their blog they mention covering health insurance for staff. • Mostly vegetarian menu. • Their milk is from St. Benoit, an organic farm in Sonoma that (re)uses glass bottles. • Coffee is sourced by direct trade partnerships, documented on the Four Barrel site. • They use real glasses for water rather than plastic. • Nice locally made ceramics.  Room for Improvement:  • Four Barrel doesn’t publish prices paid for green coffee. On their site they say “it would be an impossible waste of time for us to use one phrase to describe how and why we buy the coffees that we do.” This is understandable on one hand but also a bit of a cop out. They should at least try to be more transparent.  • Similarly, they generally don’t discuss environmental conditions of the farms they source from. It’s nice to see photos of the farmers but it would be good to see more photos of the farms themselves, with more discussion on things like percentage shade cover and sustainability.  • A lot of their toast is sold to go, in a tray with a plastic lid. It’s probably compostable (I didn’t get a chance to check) but it does seem a bit of a shame to sell something like toast and package it in a plastic box – they could have gone with cardboard but I think they want to show off how pretty the toast looks. So I’m a bit disappointed there that they are choosing form (marketing) over environmental impact. Of course, you can always have your toast for there and forgo the box.

The Mill,"The atmosphere here is chill. Gives you that, step back and relax feeling. Relax outside or inside with the natural sunlight, coming through the glass windowed wall. The tunes were uppity/chill, if that makes sense. Took a bit to get a piece of toast with jam. Tasted like toast with jam. Great bread.  Come here for the atmosphere and coffee. Chillax, listen to the tunes and smile."
The Mill,The rye toast seemed a little thin for $8. But always love the cappuccinos here.
The Mill,"Drip coffee was quite good! The person at the register said they have a ""fancy high tech drip machine"" that's as good or better than pour over in his opinion. Cortado was brewed a little weakly. Based on how it tasted I'm guessing the grind size was too large, but it was alright. Got lemon ricotta toast on rye (awesome, I don't know what the jam was but it was fantastic) and the salted almond butter on country bread (bread was awesome, almond butter was standard and nothing particularly special). Prices are your usual SF prices for fancy toast and fancy coffee. Shop was very cute, had lots of nice indoor space to sit, and there was lovely outdoor seating. There's a lot of room to park yourself, for a small coffee shop. The person at the register was super friendly and kind.  We ordered avocado toast at first and he came outside to tell us that they were out, offer us a replacement, and comp our order! Super nice!"
The Mill,"Favorite coffee shop & bakery in the area. This is the shop that taught me to bake bread! There’s really two shops combined here: four barrel coffee and Josey the baker bread. The staff is kind and the coffee & food is best in the city IMO. Seating is usually available too. Because of its greatness, the mill is very busy on weekend mornings, with a line out the door common. It’s also not cheap by any means, though I think it’s a unique spot that’s worth it."
The Mill,"There're a lot of debates going on if a toast (I mean a piece of bread) could cost $5+, BUT! I would totally recommend to experience this place on your own.  I like to sit there sipping on my cup of coffee and observe the team work and craziness going on in a bakery corner.  If you get lucky, you'll meet the owner – Josey Baker – doing his job. Oh, don't worry, you'll know it's him!"
The Mill,"Very cool place with awesome vibes. No wifi tho, so only 3 stars for me... Edit - they play really cool indie music from vinyl discs, so only for that they deserve an additional star :)"
The Mill,"Got a cappuccino. It was pricey (over $5) and a  salted chocolate babka. Cappuccino was just okay (wasn't smooth, a little too strong and bitter for me), but the babka was good. Just another pricey hipster coffee spot."
The Mill,"I’ve been looking for a place for reaaallly good drip coffee and this place so far is the winner. The bread is also worth the trip, I like to get the toast with the seasonal jam. The line is sometimes long but it moves fast!"
The Mill,"Heavenly toast, four barrel coffee, fresh baked bread, dynamo donuts, neighbor pastries, hipster vibes. An ultimate neighborhood cafe"
The Mill,Very cosy and nice place. Coffee and chocolate are great and so are the toasts!
The Mill,Service was fast and great. My poor friend dropped his coffee due to his knee and they replaced it at no cost. Very nice of them. They had a cute atmosphere too.
The Mill,Great toast in hip environment. Somewhat pricey.
The Mill,"Sourdough was good. Coffee was really sour / rancid though, beans may have gone bad. Disappointed but will try again next time."
The Mill,We sat outside with our pups and had a lovely little coffee break.
The Mill,Adore this little slice of heaven in the heart of San Francisco! The chocolate hazelnut toast is da bomb diggity!!!
The Mill,"I haven’t been or lived in San Francisco for 5+ years and The Mill still comes across my mind or up in conversation every so often.  If I could choose a cafe to put a couple locations across every major city, it would be this.  Having a diverse selection of fresh baked breads and toppings that meet dietary restrictions is such a treat.  Not to mention sweets for those who prefer them.  Walking in, you are immediately hit with a blast of nose sensation that gets you excited for whatever happens to get to enter your mouth.  Not to mention the space is beautiful and fits perfectly the dishes/drinks they serve.  Take me back."
The Mill,Absolutely splendid coffee and breads!  We prefer their cappuccinos over lattes. And the adventure bread is pretty amazing if you're gluten free. The bread feels expensive because it's small but it's very very filling and lasts a long time if refrigerated.
The Mill,"I ordered a Mocha, and it used dark chocolate which turned to have sour flavor to me. I asked the barista to remake me a latte, getting a very warm and positive feedback, as well as kind explanation. I am very glad that I finally can get in and order something, previously, it was too popular."
The Mill,"This place is my fav, great service and great pizza! Their cheese pizza is always yummy and they have different veggie pizza :)"
The Mill,The service was excellent. The coffee options were very good. The breads and pastries were freshly made and delicious. Nice ambiance and fun vibe. Really enjoyed going there and can recommend heartily.
The Mill,Overtly over rated. Mediocre toasts and coffee. Cool interior design thought and what they sell would look goon in your Instagram!
The Mill,"A cozy place to grab coffee in the day, pizza and beer at night. The bread and pizza are amazing."
The Mill,Good service and vibes👍 Their coffee and pastries were good too! …
The Mill,"My friends and I got four different toasts and they were all amazing, especially the cinnamon sugar one! Some of the best coffee in the city as well!"
The Mill,"Average SF prices with above average taste. Trendy, hip, and and nice staff. Seating and outlets are limited so come prepared not to stay. As of 11/3/17 there is no wifi. If it weren't for the wifi, The Mill would be 5 stars."
The Mill,"Coffee: good Croissant: excellent Other pastries: good Décor: nice Service: friendly, a little slow Prices: average for the area"
The Mill,"Interesting sourdough class where we learned theory, shaped loaves, enjoyed pizza slices and took our loaves home to bake."
The Mill,"Pizza was very good, very clean modern and the staff is extremely friendly love it.... great coffee shop as well"
The Mill,"The Mill is proof that spreading various assortments of butters, jams, and other curiosities on freshly-baked, sliced, and toasted bread will never go out of style."
The Mill,"The finest coffee store ever! Your coffee shop was ideal for students who wanted to unwind or read a book. If you want to go on a date, you may also ask the staff to play music that would make you want to dance with your companion. The town's coffee shop comes highly recommended! Thank you very much, gentlemen!"
The Mill,"Amazing pizza and atmosphere. $8 for Avo toast used to be a joke, now it’s a deal. The Mill is a great spot."
The Mill,"I don’t get the hype, to be honest. The coffee is fine, sf priced for sure.The pastries and fine too, nothing mind-blowing. Not sure why the bread is so popular, but maybe I just got the wrong loaf. I recommend Jane the Baker on Geary near Filmore instead, although it’s a bit of a walk from Divis."
The Mill,"Modern bakery and coffee place serving pastries and some other small bites. Portions are relatively small, and prices are probably higher than average. There’s no table service. Staff is friendly. It can get busy"
The Mill,The bread that you can buy here is almost a religious experience. It really is that good!! Just the perfect blend of a crunchy exterior and soft and spongy interior with incredible flavor. And I just love that you can have sourdough made from 100% whole grain flour.  A very special place for bread lovers!
The Mill,"There are two great parts to The Mill… the bread (which is very artisanal and nice), and the ambiance. There’s so much natural light and it’s an amazing place to write or catch up with friends. The coffee is pretty good, of course overpriced but it’s SF so what do you expect?? The highlight is definitely the toast! Yeah it’s $$ but it’s also pretty filling and delicious, always. The baristas are always friendly. It’s located on Divis so it can be a little noisy to get work done (also no wifi for better or for worse). Kind of annoying that so many digital nomads take over the space by hotspotting their laptops…"
The Mill,"No Wi-Fi which is annoying. I get it... but c'mon. Toast was great, coffee was groovy. ohhhh, but fix your front door. It squawks."
The Mill,"My favorite bread ! And they make the best toasts ! Coffee is four barrel so it's very good. I come here weekly, they are always busy. They have lots of seating room but hard to find a spot at times because they are always busy. Service is fast and friendly."
The Mill,"Yes, they are busy. During COVID the lines have been long. And they're not cheap. But I'm so grateful they are there-- they're keeping me sane with  their carbs & caffeine!! I love all their bread, but my favorites are Adventure Bread (a dark dense and seedy bread I love to eat with soup to make a full meal) and Red White + Rye (a chewy, well rounded red wheat bread that has some rye in it but no caraway seed, best all-purpose buttered toast I've ever had!!) The toasts they serve at the cafe are also a great mid-day snack, avocado or cinnamon or what have you are all great; you really can't go wrong! I drink their Four Barrel espresso rather than their coffee (though I think that's good too) and it's a perfect gorgeous sweet intense espresso worth biking miles across town for :)  I love them so!!!"
The Mill,"I've been trying to come here for years but every time I come to California, I miss the chance to stop in. Finally went in today and loved it. Lovely big space with plenty of seating. The sunlight sifting through while you drink your delicious coffee is very dreamy. Lady who took my order was lacking some customer service - kindness doesn't cost anything. A smile is all it takes sometimes to feel welcomed. Otherwise, would recommend."
The Mill,"Excellent pastries, coffee decor and ambiance. The barista was super nice too."
The Mill,"While buying $4-6 toast might seem like the most stereotypically millennial indulgence, the Mill has perfected the art of toast. If you're into sweet, you can't go wrong with the cinnamon toast. 5/5!"
The Mill,"Different ambiance for US, but definitely overrated. Too crowded and noisy on Saturdays."
The Mill,Love their bread so much! They have delicious pastries and toast to eat at the place. Perfect weekend morning food.
The Mill,"Amazing breads made daily. Their style tends to focus mostly on dense breads that are earthy or unique, but they do have light breads with a softer interior. The crusts are always amazing! Some tend to be a bit rough after being toasted, but all are delicious.  They make different styles of toast that changes daily. I've never been disappointed with any that I've tried.  Coffee style and selection is really good, but nothing amazing."
The Mill,Went here for breakfast on my birthday and got the avocado toast and the twice baked pistachio croissant.  They were both really good. The croissant was one of the best things I have ever eaten. I will be back for sure!
The Mill,"We travel up to Divisadero just to go to The Mill! Four Barrel coffee done correctly here, and the bakery is a superb pairing with it. Bravo, well done!"
The Mill,"Cool options for a smaller breakfast. Loved the different types of toast available. We ordered the cinnamon, avocado, and jam toasts which seemed to all be daily specials that they change frequently. Unfortunately, the seating was very limited, and their coffee was bitter in my opinion."
The Mill,"As an Aussie, we love our breakfast/brunch  Mill 🙏🏻 thank you ❤️❤️ best in town …"
The Mill,Yummy coffee a d good variety of toasts.  Good hangout spot to people watch.
The Mill,"Nice atmosphere. Not cramped like many other cafes in the city. The black iced coffee I had was great - clean and sweet flavors, not bitter at all. Good selection of Four Barrel whole beans and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Prices on par with similar cafes like Blue Bottle."
The Mill,"One of the very best coffee shops in San Francisco. Really good coffee, really nice pastries, and great vibes. Highly recommended."
The Mill,"Most delicious latte I have ever had. Four Barrel delivers such quality beans and the baristas here know how to use them. On top of that, service was quick and polite."
The Mill,"The toast is tasty, though burned along the crust. I like the burnt crust taste, but if you don't like burnt food, you may want to think twice about ordering the toast. I personally like the toast a lot. The coffee was ok. I expected better. I slightly liked the coffee more at Trouble Coffee which was near where I stayed. Neither of these cafes had coffee nearly as good as what I make at home in a $20 Mr. Coffee drip machine with a basic grinder and Kirkland/Starbucks beans from Costco. The mill had a long table filled with people hunched over laptops, hard at work. There was no available seating at first. During the long wait for my toast, I did find a seat along the serving bar area. Waiting without a seat was awkward. I was made to feel in the way because wherever I stood, a staff member would need to get around me or get past. I got a few looks from the staff as if I was a stranger who just walked into Cheers. When I did sit down, I overheard what sounded like a big tech deal being made over some website. I visited during mid morning on a weekday, so I imagine that this place is always crowded with limited or no available seating."
The Mill,"Great open environment. Perfect place for your favorite caffeinated beverage and some super thick-cut Texas toast with toppings of your choosing. Very tasty. Also a great spot for indulging in a little pizza for only $3.50 a slice. Go simple with a cheese or pepperoni pizza, or try specialty slice for the day. Tasty baked goods as well are definitely worth trying out. And of course, Josey Baker bread 👍"
The Mill,Nice coffee and good tasting toasts! I definitely recommend the pumpkin butter one!
The Mill,Great toast! They have interesting combinations. The bread and spreads are made fresh and have top quality ingredients. The coffee bar makes a solid latte. It can get crowded and you could wait 15-20 minutes for your toast on weekends and holidays.
The Mill,"Yes it's homemade style bread but it's effin incredible.  Part of the appeal is that I don't have the time and patience for making my own bread but it's still good.  Coffee is fine.  I'm not a coffee snob.  I'm really rating this place a 5 because it's close to home, space is great and open, wait is not crazy yet and there is always good people watching.  I'm pretty binary with ratings as well.  Places that warrant a review are either 5 or 1.  Who has time to figure out a 4 from a 5 or any other combination!"
The Mill,This place combines the best of both worlds--awesome coffee roasted in house and authentic SF style bakery. It serves pizza from 6pm.  Seating is plentiful and not cramped. Baristas are friendly and knowledgeable. Outdoor seating is available for dogs and their owners. Very stylish but unpretentious decor. The only criticism I have is that there are no electrical outlets for charging laptops and phones.
The Mill,"A little hipster, a little yuppie, a lot delicious. Their toast is amazing and the coffee is a great compliment. Loved the open floor plan and modern architecture!  It's a little pricey and the lines can get long, but otherwise definitely worth a visit!"
The Mill,"Service it’s just ok, food good but cold , they don’t warm up the pastry which makes a big difference on th experience"
The Mill,"I personally feel this place is way too crowded during the weekend, there’s no way you can find any seating and honestly, the coffee is ok but not fabulous. I may consider to come back during weekday but definitely not weekend,"
The Mill,"Life-changing loaves that everyone should treat themselves to, but get there early because they typically sell out by late morning. Solid coffee and nice place to do work or meet up with friends."
The Mill,"Nice open air seating, and the line moves quickly. Four Barrel coffee is on nitro tap here. Toast is, as expected delicious, whether you like sweet or savory spreads. I just can't justify spending $8 on a piece of avocado toast again."
The Mill,"Cute place near where I live. I love their gluten free Adventure Bread, you have to try it! Their tumeric wellness tea is yummy too. I also took their bread making class as a company team offsite, that was a lot of fun. Great space for coffee and hang out, although a bit pricey and pretty crowded on the weekends."
The Mill,"Excellent coffee at a beautiful location. They really went all out in preparing this space. The baking bread adds an incredible aroma and the coffee is exactly what you've come to expect from Four Barrel. Of course, the prices are right where you would expect them too... $4-6 for toast seems a bit extreme. Otherwise, great!  Not quite 5 stars because of overflowing levels of pretentiousness."
The Mill,"I would say service with a smile but with masks you never know. But yes you can tell they're all smiling. The lattes are amazing. If you need anything other than sugar (i.e. stevia, etc) make sure to ask for it. Great service, delicious bread and really good food."
The Mill,the bread and toast are great to try.  nice cozy place.
The Mill,"Great Coffee, great breakfast, BEAUTIFUL space but most of all STUNNING outside seating area! If the weather is nice you can not sit better than there and have the best bread breakfast with friends or all by your own! Love it!"
The Mill,So far so good. I had a latte and a chocolate croissant ( not the best I've ever had but good).  There is no WiFi so don't plan to work here if you need internet.  The restaurant design and set up look very pretty.  There is a large variety of breads and toasts too. You can also buy cups and other products
The Mill,"What can one say about $5 toast? People love to hate on it, but it tastes delicious.  Josey Baker bread (made here) is simply fantastic and worth trying if you've never had it. That plus the presence of expertly brewed coffee in a bright, airy space makes this place an enjoyable stop on any tour of the city.  Plus the whole place is painfully hip. A perfect encapsulation of the current San Francisco zeitgeist."
The Mill,Nice cafe but the brown sugar toast was not as tasty as I would have expected. Whatever type of non-white bread they used didn’t mesh well with the brown sugar flavor and it was a bit over toasted.
The Mill,The mocha was on the sweet side but still tasty.
The Mill,Great little coffee shop. Good coffee and nice toasts. I’d come here again
The Mill,"Super hipster joint. I ordered an espresso and toast to get a sense of their standard fare. The espresso was AWFUL - I'm a coffee snob, so I was expecting something really great... but was really disappointed by the sour taste. Sour... not bitter. Ugh. I almost sent it back but figured it wasn't worth it. They were out of toast... so no review there. The space is huge and airy and beautiful, but I feel that's all it has going for it."
The Mill,Got some cold coffee here. Like the interiors!
The Mill,"The Mill is practically Four Barrel coffee fresh bread - or a bakery powered by Four Barrel coffee, as you like. I have only good things to say about this place. Starting with the quality of their bread, sandwiches, and pastries, to the flavorful different kinds of coffee drinks, and not to mention the nice, modern layout of the store.  Stiff prices, yes, but if you live in San Francisco you're probably used to it by now. It's hard to get seating any time of day unless you show up at 7am, but on sunny days there is outdoor seating in the ""parklet"" available.  Four Barrel and fresh bread - in for the win."
The Mill,"I am on my third visit to SF and I some how always end up coming here! It's got a great aesthetic, quick service, and friendly baristas! I really love how the toast is t too sweet and that the coffee is thoughtfully crafted! Thanks for always being a spot on my visits!!"
The Mill,"The only time I think I will ever say a piece of toast was actually worth $4! Rich and dense bread topped with gooey almond butter, it was just divine. And a great pair to my almond milk coffee. Only complaint I had was that it was a bit chilly as they would only close one of the two open doors. San Francisco can be cold, my coffee shop should be warm and toasty!"
The Mill,Trendy place that specializes in fancy toast. Bread is great and they have about 8 different types of toppings on a given day. Can be very busy and seating is limited but is easy enough to order it and go. Is a little price for what is essentially a slice of bread and a few toppings but very tasty.
The Mill,It's a great environment to relax eat toast and drink coffee. The toast is amazing and their freshly brewed coffee is so good! The workers are so nice and after you go once you'll end up going every week!
The Mill,Got to go there for the toast. Its pricey but very good. My favorite is the hazelnut spread with butter and sea salt. They usually have a more savory toast option available which is often different each time I go in. Some of those are really good as well but typically go for something more sweet.
The Mill,"I understand why this is a popular coffeeshop, but it really is kind of overrated. The coffees are fine, not mind blowing. But the toasts. Man, they are not good. Too hard, not enough topping, bland toppings, and just not worth the price. Also, really hard to find parking nearby. Anyway, go once to try it out. I've been here twice, and probably won't be back."
The Mill,"Expensive, but you do get higher quality drinks and eats. Lattes come out at the perfect temp, which usually means they take care not to burn their espresso. And, combined with steamed almond milk, you get a nice nutty character to the latte.  The bread is notable. I usually get the almond butter and butter and sea salt bread.  I've never been here when there wasn't a crowd, so expect to wait in line. Parking in the area is also tough..."
The Mill,"I was really excited to come out of my way on a weekend morning for some good coffee and toast. Ordered and the toast came out quickly. I make better toast at home, seriously. Not great at all. The coffee took about 15 minutes to be done. It was good coffee, but there seems to be a major backlog of coffee orders."
The Mill,By far my most favorite café in SF! The ambiance and interior is preserved from Four Barrels so it's very clean and modern. The bakery is phenomenal here with their toast menu. I'd definitely recommend their wheat toast with home made jam. It hits the spot with their drip coffee! A place that lives up to its hype.
The Mill,"The best chewiest brown breads, rich delicious breakfast pastries, good coffee, light airy atmosphere good for studying if it's not too crowded or just socializing. Staff could be friendlier. Haven't been for pizza and beer but look forward to going."
The Mill,"Famous for it's toast, The Mill also offers lots of tasty pasties, as well as excellent coffee / tea. It's a lovely place with small tables as well as one big tables for people to hang out / work. It's usually easy to get a table and service is quick. Toast is yummy although quite pricey."
The Mill,I go to this place almost everyday. They put all other coffee places in the area to shame which should come as no surprise because it's Four Barrel Coffee. They also bake bread here which is also really good. I usually get an almond milk latte and I can't recommend it enough. I also like the adventure bread because it's made from seeds and psyllium husks and not flour.
The Mill,"Not all restaurants are for all people. And if you're sensible, this one isn't for you. Coffee was terrible and so was my fellow clientele--which when you're packed in sitting shoulder to shoulder makes a big difference. The workers and service was good though 👌 The food is exspensive, as is San Francisco labor, so no gripes there. But it's been awhile since I've felt that much like a fish out of water, really terrible feeling, I'd never go back."
The Mill,"So this is the famous ""$4 toast"". Turns out it's not quite $4, and by calling thick chunks of baked-on-the-premises German-quality bread, toasted and liberally covered with homemade cream cheese, faux-Nutella or almond butter ""toast"" you are doing Josey the baker a gross disservice. That said, their menu does consist almost entirely of these single slices of bread, amazing though it is. The coffee is excellent too."
The Mill,"This is my favorite coffee spot in the city. Coffee by Four Barrel, toast by Josey Baker, a snazzy design (which includes local, rotating art), you really can't go wrong. Lattes and cappuccinos are high quality and can be made with almond milk. For toast, you'll generally find something with cream cheese, cinnamon and sugar, some kind of homemade (or locally made) jam, or almond butter atop all different kinds of bread. I really can't recommend just one because I. Love. Them. All. Also, there's a cute, new parklet out front, and Josey's started making pizza (!) on Mondays. If none of these things can make you linger a little longer, take your coffee and toast to go and stroll through Alamo Square."
The Mill,Great place to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere. A little bit loud but still enjoyable. Food is very tasty. But it's also very overpriced. Do not expect to get any kind of meat. Plan to pay for the experience and not necessarily to have a full belly. Not in any way ideal for the hungry meat eater who loves big plates.
The Mill,"Excellent atmosphere: double height ceiling with cozy natural light, an open-air bakery and segmented barrista stations, craft pottery for sale, and long communal tables. Usually pretty busy. Highly recommend the mocha for fans of unsweetened dark chocolate; it's very full-bodied. Fresh bread smells abound. Usually pretty busy, though it's rare to not be able to find a space opening up somewhere."
The Mill,This is the best coffee I've had. The lattes are good and they finish the cup with cool artwork. I love that the jelly they use it whatever fruit is in season. I'm from southern CA and I make sure to visit this coffee shop every time I go to SFO.
The Mill,"I went here once at night, and it was quiet and very relaxing to have a seat and sip a cappuccino.  I love the lofty gallery space and wanted to check it out in the day.  The second time I was here with a friend and we finally demystified the Josey Baker toast and Four Barrel coffee together.  The toast is hearty and a thick cut. I liked the jam-like pumpkin butter more than the almond butter with honey, but would try them both again.  I kind of wish they had a tea or alternative drink for my friend who doesn't drink coffee, but other than that it's a great place to have a light meal or snack, depending on what you think (or your tummy thinks) the portion represents.  You can also buy a loaf of bread."
The Mill,I'm from New Hampshire and this is the Best toast I've ever eaten! I'd come back just for this. I haven't stopped dreaming about it for months...
The Mill,Still one of my favourite coffee shops in San Francisco. Fabulous bread and coffee. Beautiful design. Eye watering prices.
The Mill,"This place looks beautiful, clean and is pretty relaxed, if a little hipster. Get there early on a weekend to grab a seat and savour the specialist coffee. Staff are usually friendly and if a little cool for school occasionally. The fresh bread is aces!"
The Mill,It was alright! I had a pistachio croissant which I wish they could heat it up for me but they didn't have the option. The coffee was alright I wish they had filled my cup but it was less than half full. Not impressed after my first visit. Will try their toast one day and hopefully they'd give me a reason to update my review.
The Mill,I want there because they told me that it was the best bakery in San Francisco. I don't think that's probably true but food is tasty. There some cool opções to buy their bread mix to do it at home. Keep in mind that on weekends lines are very long but the move along quickly.
The Mill,Pricey coffees that don't taste that great (burned beans).  Their breads taste pretty good but they are overpriced as well and the two I picked were extremely oily which does explain the taste.  Oh and on popular times this place has a 10+ minute wait to just get coffee.
The Mill,Coffee and toast was good but it was so crowded there was no place to sit and enjoy it
The Mill,"Asked for a light roast coffee, the cute barista poured me a dark roast with a straight but dumb expression. I thought if I should ask him for my money back ($1 tip included for some reason too!), but decided against it and found a cute chair in the back and admired their interior design and all the white people occupying the space. I guess it's a nice space. But their coffee, well, it tasted as good as McDonald's brew tbh. McDonald's is better than Burger King, so it gets 2 stars. 3 star is for Wendy's and 4 star for 5 Guys, I was told."
The Mill,"This place has a great vibe!  I got an Americano and a #1 (rye toast with cream cheese, pepper, and salt), and it was a great savory snack. Though the loaf of bread is $6, and my small slice was $3.75, so I almost felt like I should have just bought the loaf!  The place is very packed - I went at 3 pm and the line was out the door!  Definitely don't go in big groups as it'll be hard to find a place for everyone to sit.  But good vibe!"
The Mill,"Really nice place that's a short walk away from the Painted Ladies. Come here for a teabreak after visiting the beautiful Victorian houses. The Mill serves really awesome toast and equally amazing coffee. The ambience of the entire cafe is wonderful, as people just sit there to do their work and catch up with their friends. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and you can be sure that their recommendations would be great for your appetite. We tried the cinnamon and raisin toast, coupling it with an organic milk latte. Gorgeous tea break. After that, we simply crossed the road for some bbq at 4505 BBQ and Grill. Awesome day!"
The Mill,"Don’t do it. It’s tempting. It’s hipster. But there’s absolutely nothing to justify the prices. Except for the coffee. That was tasty. For the record, I had a jam toast on adventure bread and a flat white. Total with tip was 17 bucks!"
The Mill,"I stopped by after work to meet with my roommate.  While waiting for her, I ordered a cinnamon and sugar toast and hot chocolate.  Yes, the toast is expensive, but I thought it was delicious, especially with the hot chocolate.  As sweet as it sounds, the hot chocolate wasn't so it actually was a nice balance.  I'm not sure if I'd pay $4 for toast again, but if I happen to be in the area and was in the mood for something filling, I'd stop by."
The Mill,Busy but great coffee and atmosphere. If you want a table the rotate out pretty fast and plenty of outside seating.
The Mill,I absolutely love this place! Best bread in town along with Tartine. The cinnamon sugar toast is just mouthwatering good! They only have whole-milk which is annoying. For all the Danes out there this is also a place to get ryebread as we know it!
The Mill,"Yea, this place is great. The Mill has become a nearly-weekly staple for me and my girlfriend. From their delicious toast and espresso drinks to the chic ambience and amazing pastries, I don't see myself straying anytime soon."
The Mill,"Delicious over priced toast. They also have a selection of pastries, fresh baked breads, and pancake mixes. Lots of seating. Not good for groups.  They mill their own grain to make flour. Some of the best bread in San Francisco.  In the afternoon/evening they serve pizza."
The Mill,"Their bread is like flavorful heaven. I don't support the overpriced toast craze, but one bite of this bread will make you reconsider. I'm a particular fan of the Parmesan crusted loaf, but you can't go wrong with any choice. Be sure to arrive early!"
The Mill,Great cafe in great neighborhood. Take a book to read here!
The Mill,"Good coffee, good pizza. The service has been straight up rude before. IDK maybe once you grow to the size of four barrel there's a lack of ownership. The prices are hella high for coffee and regularly see the Tesla / Gbus crowd around. Cool, but not my thing."
The Mill,"I'm surprised by my negative experience at this place.  My friend had been here before, was excited to go again and take me with her. The aesthetic of this place is awesome and so beautiful. They do their toast alright. My friend ordered the chocolate hazelnut, sea salt and butter toast. Size wise, it was huge and taste was good but they put way too much butter on. There were some parts of the bread that was soggy with butter. Now we go on to the coffee which was very unappetizing. We decided to split an almond milk Cappy and I'm so glad we did because ours was barely drinkable. Upon first sip, I noticed that the drink was very watery. I pushed back the foam on top and sure enough, it looked more like drip coffee with a splash of milk not an espresso based drink. I take the drink back to the counter and say that I ordered a Cappy and that this didn't look like a cappy (also to note, they made us an 8 oz Cappy which is always a red flag to me because cappys are traditionally 5 oz drinks). The barista was very dismissive of my concern. He told me that ""that's just how their almond milk is"". This is also a red flag because it's 2019 and very quality barista series milk alternatives is incredibly easy. I asked what brand they used and he said it was called Good Life (so I guess never buy their stuff unless you like watery nut milks?). I ask him what I can do to get a Cappy like the classic 1:3 foam, milk, coffee ratio and he says thats just impossible with their nut milks. He also tells me that when the drinks are sitting out for 10-15 minutes, they get that curdly watery look. I clarified to him that we had gotten this drink way less than 10 minutes ago. The barista then challenged me saying that he could look at the receipt so check the time stamp. I just told him that I didn't think that was necessary (and also, what would be the point of that?). Then he told me that there is no point in trying the other milk alternative option, hemp, because it's going to do the same thing. I decide to risk it ( I guess) and when it came out, it was at least not all curdled like the last one but it was still incredibly watery and barely any microfoam on top. The barista acted like it was weird for me to expect quality alternative milk (like I said, it's 2019 so drinking milk subs isn't weird anymore).  It was such a weird experience and I'm not sure what I could have done to not have this happen. I didn't come up to the barista aggressively. This is a good place to go if you only care about getting some good insta pictures and a loaf of bread to go. Save actually getting coffee so some other San Fransisco favorites."
The Mill,"The wait times and prices are are somewhat ridiculous, but that is the norm in San Francisco coffee shops. Definitely worth going to at least once for the experience, and worth going back to if you have enough free time. Just make sure the cashier actually takes your order; sometimes the people that make the toast never actually get your name."
The Mill,The coffee was perfect. I love all the breads and menu choices. Check it out.
The Mill,"The atmosphere is lovely here but that's the best part. The pastry I bought was good but pricey and they don't offer to heat it for you. In my experience, friendliness is not a virtue at the Mill. With no outlets and no wifi the general vibe is ""give us your money and get out"""
The Mill,"Good coffee, overrated toasts, local bread options, long lines."
The Mill,"Expensive however, clean, bright, good coffee, pretty people. I'd give them 5 stars if they had reasonable prices and a bit less attitude.  Difficult to get a seat at times and on the pricy side. For example a large coffee is $3.25 but you is the size of small coffee elsewhere. Most of the seating is at long communal tables but there are a few individual tables and they have a parklet outside that gets afternoon light but shaded and cold in the morning. There are not many of any outlets for chargers so you won't see that many people with laptops surfing or working. Bread is very good but also quite expensive."
The Mill,"Best bread ,, I have been living in America for 6 years.  I finally found the best bread I can eat.  I'm from Turkey, bread is very important to us."
The Mill,"Amazing little place in San Francisco. The toast seems a little pricey until you buy it. The slices are thick and they do not hold back on the toppings you chose (Nutella, jam, pesto, etc.) Certainly could be a meal"
The Mill,"Not a bad little coffee shop in SF. I love the aesthetics and atmosphere here but the prices can be a little steep. I love the idea of grabbing a piece of toast with your coffee, but the coast of both items is a little ridiculous. Overall not a bad place to grab a cup of coffee and relax."
The Mill,"I came here after reading reviews myself about Josie Baker Bread.  Yes, the bread is wonderful and I would most definitely buy again.  As for The Mill, I broke down and bought a piece of toast which they are known for.  I paid $3.95 which is pretty pricey.  I also went in the late afternoon and while there weren't many people in front of me, I waited about 10 minutes for my toast.  Really?  The space is wide and open, and would be a great place to set up shop for an afternoon on the laptop, except they don't offer wifi.  There are a lot of other coffee shops in SF that offer more for a better price.  So while it wasn't bad, I just don't get all the hype."
The Mill,It's a nice space and the toast is good but a lot of the toppings are superfluous e.g. the butter in #4 you can't taste at all. Better off building your own since they charge it a la carte anyway. I only went with a pre combo bc I thought they knew what they were doing.  It's also such a scene. People there to be seen lol.
The Mill,"Took the avocado mash, it was good and the staff was friendly."
The Mill,Nice a dark mountain rye and hot latte ;-)
The Mill,"hey everyone. Frank here again to report that you’ve never had a thicker, more beautiful, more perfectly prepared slice of toast in your life. come here and eat that toast. the decaf is OK. much love"
The Mill,"Great coffee and great toast. The cream cheese on mountain rye bread is a must-have. If you want eat-in, avoid in the early afternoon because the sun beams through the west-facing shopfront and sears the customers inside."
The Mill,"My favorite coffee shop in SF! Well lit, kind staff, great coffee and amazing bread. I spend a couple hours here journaling and working every Sunday. Sometimes it's hard to get a seat but it's worth the wait."
The Mill,"They don't have wifi or vanilla syrup. I get that you have to maintain the pretentious vibe but bitter coffee and $4 toast isn't going to do it for me. Having exposed wood and an open layout will probably be enough to keep tourists and unemployed people coming back, but if you're looking to actually do work in a coffee shop look elsewhere."
The Mill,"Fantastic place. The coffee is delicious and the place is chill. No plugs however do it's only good for get togethers or fully charged laptops with independent internet connection. However, compared to the divisadero street options, it's my choice. The desert is also delicious. The baristas are prpfessionals and very helpful if you have specific asks. There might be a line when you arrive but it's worth the wait."
The Mill,Latte was delicious and served quickly. We found a nice table quickly and even at 9am! There was a perfect heart in the foam. 😍 There is also a lovely parklet out front which is nice even though it was a bit chilly.  I'll be returning!
The Mill,"Crowded but seats come easily enough. Incredibly tasty fresh bread though the toast menu, a rotating set of about 3 toppings and 4 breads. Well poured coffee but inconsistent timing could mean a cold late by the time the toast is ready. Pieces of toast have been shrinking in size lately, when it was already expensive."
The Mill,Amazing Toats! A little too crown on Saturday
The Mill,"The mill is the best place to get coffee, bread, and get lost reading a good book. While the lines can get long and the setting can be loud, it's a wonderful place to stop by for an hour or so. There's no wifi but for good reason as I think people would really then hang around too much. Don't worry too much about which piece of toast to get as they all taste good :)"
The Mill,"Best latte I ever had (so much better than starbucks no joke!) and the girl at the counter was so very friendly and tolerant of my questions to get one that was ok for my diabetic self :)  Update: even though I'm only in San Fran a few times a year,  went back with my boyfriend and his sister when she was in town and that latte was still just as good as I remembered.  It's so far the only latte I like without anything- no sweetener of any kind.  It's just so smooth and the milk is enough on its own here.  I wish they had a San Jose branch."
The Mill,I still can't get over the fact that I'm paying $4 for toast but it is toast done well with very hearty bread and equally hearty spreads.  Lots of Instagramers hang out here and the light in the morning by the windows is great for making portraits.  If I go here it is for the ambience and to meet people.
The Mill,"What more can one say - top notch coffee, home made bread in the truest sense of the phrase, and an open and inviting atmosphere.  Is it expensive?  Yes.  Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  Make sure to arrive early to avoid the line out the door"
The Mill,Bread lives up to the hype.  Had square croissant with sesame inside cream cheese and chives.   Had sesame bread.  Hearty bread but a tad salty.
The Mill,"The garlic knot was ok, the hot chocolate was flavorless, the service was passive aggressive"
The Mill,"Coffee is exceptional. Breads cooked on premise. Interior is beautiful. The line goes out the door, but it doesn't seem to matter. Blue bottle and Sightglass fans will love this place."
The Mill,Lovely interior. Amazing iced coffee. People from all strokes of (middle class+) life. And very very good bread. The line is always a bit long but the employees got their routines on fleek and it always moves forward fast.
The Mill,"Didn't get a chance to try their baked goods, only had an espresso, which was a bit on the burnt side, perhaps too roasted  (a common issue in many coffee shops). However, I enjoyed the cool ambience and watching one of the baristas preparing perfectly crafted macchiatoes and lattes."
The Mill,"Great coffee (four barrel) and toast (cinnamon-sugar and Nutella). Super hip environment. Would be five stars if they did a better job tidying up after the swarms of sloppy yuppies that make a mess everywhere (tables and bathrooms). I feel bad deducting a star due to sloppy clientele, but it really does detract from the experience."
The Mill,"The artisanal toast trend is an odd one to comprehend, but The Mill's selections are quite good and don't break the bank.  Be sure to arrive early in the morning before the rush for a Zen like atmosphere. Afterwards, it gets pretty hectic.  Also, don't miss out on the nightly pizza. Delicious garlicy crust."
The Mill,"It was ok. My mocha wasn’t that good. My toast was better. $16 I would’ve at least expected WiFi. Went to avoid starbucks, grab a snack and get a little work done but- guess I’m heading to Starbucks anyway."
The Mill,"From the coffee to the toast, everything at The Mill is all about attention to detail. They're Doing It Right over here. It's not expensive, but it's not cheap; excellence rarely is.  If you're lucky enough to stop in while there's an einkorn loaf on the rack, grab it. It's one of the best breads I've ever had—and that's saying something because I've had the seed feast, too."
The Mill,"Worth the price and the bougie scarlet letter. They serve the best damn toast, and you'd be hard-pressed to convince me otherwise. Nice open air, good bread, and lively. Hit this place up if you're in SF!"
The Mill,"Great coffee and baked goods, love the vibe and is normally quiet enough to read.  No WiFi, which means fewer laptops (which I like).  If you plan to do work here, prep your phone for tethering the whole time.  Get the toast, cookies, or a latte and enjoy the breeze that they let fill the open layout."
The Mill,"Great Four-barrel coffee and delicious, house-made baked goods.  Calm, minimalist interior full of Divisadero hipsters.  Still, the place is friendlier than it first appears and there's no Wi-Fi, so only a few people are buried in their laptops. There's a nice parklet in front. Come in and have a pistachio croissant and take home a warm loaf of bread."
The Mill,"Monday night and you don't care for football, go to the Mill for pizza night. Just one veggie choice but it's always good. Put you order in, slices or whole pizza then find a place to sit. Since it takes 30 minutes walk on down to Bi-Rite for beer or wine and your set. If you know how good Josey Baker bread is just imagine the pizza. Busy and a bit loud but a fun and interesting night out. Grab a place to sit as it does get crowded and check with them for when the pizza is done since it's low key on the delivery aspect."
The Mill,"coffee tastes rushed and it's noisy in here.. that said, it's decent and they use good beans - maybe I'll try a drip coffee. they have fresh bread and it's a cool space. I'd come again but I would probably not go out of my way to do so."
The Mill,"“Great place for working on laptop”  No wifi, no power outlets. Gentrified and sterile, staff that look at you funny when you ask questions."
The Mill,"Very nice place for morning breakfast. Amazing atmosphere, service and taste."
The Mill,"With some of the nicest baristas in the city, The Mill is definitely one place a tourist (or a local) shouldn't pass up. Steps from Alamo Square, this Four Barrel/Josey Baker Bread collaboration features only coffee drinks, and homemade pastries and bread for the liking. Be sure to come in early to smell the loaves of bread baking in the oven...and don't underestimate the almond milk lattes...they are better than the cow's milk ones!"
The Mill,"This place is definitely overrated. The bread is decent, but the prices you pay and for what you get is hysterical. Plenty of places with same quality avocado toast and almost half the price. The avocado proportion to bread is also laughable. I either need twice as much avocado or half the slice of bread.  What's even funnier is that a slice of bread and jam is $6 pre tax."
The Mill,"I purchased a bread from The Mill. The price tag was mismatched. It was a simple thing. I warned the cashier. Instead of fixing the issue, she was upset with me. I had a bad customer experience. Other than that, the Mill is in a nice location and the bread was delicious. When I pay, $7.50 for a bread, I expect at least above an average customer experiencing."
The Mill,Just.the.bomb.  Bread Fresh bread Fresh delicious warm fantastic yummy bread Great coffees cold and hot PB like you've never had Many butters and jams Delish  PS Kayla recommended drinks and a slice today - GREAT! Almond butter and honey big shout out for the recs
The Mill,"Go to the Mill to work your eyes, your mind, and your mouth. Coffee is good to the last drip, and the one cashier looks like something out of the movie, "" BlowUp "" or a "" This is England "" Episode. The waffles are savory, and so are the other items. If you're looking for a seat past 9am, forget it. Go here early. This has a heavy rotating crowd, which is nice because there are less laptop campers!"
The Mill,"I wanted to give three stars since their main food option is toast and it's not large pieces and yet quite pricey, but being a cafe that doesn't have WiFi (free or otherwise) just seems Draconian to me. The cashier seemed oh so unfazed at my incredulity about this and thought it no big deal. It really confounded me. Not a place I plan to revisit."
The Mill,"Bread larger than the toppings. No egg which you'd think would be a natural accompaniment for toast. Coffee OK but got asked for a 'size' for a flat white (hint: they're always 6oz). Sunday's NY Times (it's Thursday). SF's ""fancy toast"" is incredibly weak compared to NY, Melbourne or London."
The Mill,"The long lines here are an indication that this Hayes Valley coffee shop is special and has been discovered. The Mill serves artisanal coffee, espressos and fresh pastries. They have Affogato on the menu: a scoop of vanilla ice cream served in hot espresso.  Right behind the counter is an open kitchen space where the staff at The Mill prepares baked goods and the baristas froth up milk for lattes. It's not walled off from the customer's sitting area, which is furnished with warm wooden chairs and open community style tables. The high windows facing Divisadero let in sunlight.  When I visited with my friend, it was a Saturday and The Mill was packed. If you can get a seat, it's a comfortable environment, but it took about five to ten minutes for a seat to open up at peak hours. As you'd expect, it was noisy with chatter, so it might be better to look for a smaller place if your objective is to get work done. However, if you're looking for a nice place for a coffee date with a friend, this is the place."
The Mill,My favorite bread & coffee shop.im SF.  Really good freshly baked bread
The Mill,"I'm apprehensive in saying it, but I think the pizza here is better than Arizmendi's. They also have beer, which is always a plus.  We tried their ""Big Salad"" too. It was very fresh, and I always appreciate a Seinfeld reference."
The Mill,This was the best place I have ever been for breakfast. The bread is amazing. The atmosphere is really awesome. Their toasts are SO GOOD. The staff is all friendly and awesome.
The Mill,"Yes, the hype is true: get the toast, it *is* as good as they say.  Also, if you love their sourdough bread, ask them about their classes! They run workshops in the evening, and it's a great experience."
The Mill,"Friendly staff, the pizzas are thin and crunchy crust. Tried the garlic knots and someone in my party found them too spicy, too much chili flakes but they were tasty, more similar to a mini bread loaf than a knot though."
The Mill,Great coffee and cookies but I can't believe that in 2022 the place doesn't offer Wi-fi to clients.
The Mill,Classy coffee spot. 0 outlets.
The Mill,"Unfortunately, this place is usually crowded and it's hard to find a seat. Many people of camp out here. If you around a bit, someone's bound to finish their coffee and toast and head out. Alternatively, if it's a nice day, go to Alamo Square Park nearby and enjoy your beverage and baked good there."
The Mill,"I can't believe how much I paid for a slice of toast. It was a good slice of toast, real thick, but... it was a slice of toasted bread with butter and salt on it. Actually, the salt may have been special. Like salt from an ancient meteor strike in the Himalayas or something.  Your best bet is to buy a whole loaf of bread, which they make right there. It looks and smells absolutely fantastic. Then, unplug someone's laptop, plug in your smuggled toaster, and voila—you're in business!"
The Mill,Favorite coffee place in SF!
The Mill,"Aesthetics are spot-on. It's a beautiful place with great coffee drinks and croissants, but often very crowded and difficult to grab a seat. Outdoor seating could be more comfortable."
The Mill,Here's what you'll find at The Mill. 1. Outstanding coffee and espressos (Four Barrel beans). 2. Made from scratch toast with fresh and creative toppings. 3. The world's most expensive toast. 4. A very crowded space.
The Mill,"Forget Italy, forget Seattle -- San Francisco may be the best coffee city in the world at the moment. It has the traditional Italian style coffees in North Beach, the dark roast of Peets, and the latest batch of new lighter complex roasts from Blue Bottle, Sightglass, Ritual, or what they serve here at The Mill, which is Four Barrel.  The coffee here is superb, and the interior is beautifully designed.  Be prepared for very long lines -- the only weekend afternoon I saw with no lines was when all the hipsters were away at Burning Man."
The Mill,"What can you say about shelling $5 for a toast? It's worth it. Bread was baked to perfection, and the cinnamon plus sugar was a real treat.  Good service, with a smile."
The Mill,"I never knew there were places that specialized in toast before. I also didn't know toast could ever be something I'd want to go back for, but now I do. I got the bird bread, but also got to try some of the rye and the sesame, and I think the rye was probably my favorite (served with cream cheese and black pepper on it). I also got a macchiato, which was as good as any other macchiato I've ever had. Obviously it's a specialty shop (toast and coffee, primarily) but there is definitely something to be said for sticking with what you know and what you can do amazingly well. It was pretty packed when I was there (mid-afternoon on a Saturday) and a little slow, so definitely not a place where you should expect to be in and out quickly."
The Mill,"I like coming here for a quick snack and beverage to catch up with friends. By snack I mean the infamous $3.50 toast and by beverage I mean coffee (usually an Americano, Drip, Cold Brew or a Macchiato.) The space is warm and inviting, but the music they play can get a bit loud for my taste. I like seeing Josie Baker's staff make bread as well. My preferred toast is the one with pumpkin butter on wheat sprinkled with sea salt."
The Mill,"Not usually a coffee drinker so I ordered a mocha. And it was the best mocha I've ever had -- deep rich chocolate flavors, kinda like hot coco I'd get from Dandelion chocolate."
The Mill,"Always a great expressed coffee , made with some of the best beans in town. And warm Josey Baker bread! Nice people, very cool environment with vinyl playing the background."
The Mill,"It's not cheap for what is essentially just a posh slice of toast, but it's delicious, and the setting is beautiful. Great Four Barrel coffee, and awesome chocolate chip scones!"
The Mill,"Overpriced trendy hipster spot that only sells toast one slice at a time for $8 each with some weak, thin, avocado slop on the top. And $3.75 for a small coffee is a rip off too."
The Mill,"Toast is of course what you come for here. And yes, it is quite delicious. I would give this 5 stars for the toast and their great coffee, but part of me cries inside with every bite of that delicious $8 toast..."
The Mill,"I eat pizza 4 out of 7 days, just a slice. Did I say I like pizza? I find it to be the perfect snack - carbs, proteins, vitamins.  So whenever Arizmendi in the Mission has a day off (Tuesdays) or they have unnatural toppings (I am looking at you comice pears or potato or something ungodly that you simply do not put on pizza without giving an Italiano grandmother a mini heart attack), I head over to The Mill.  This is a hipster place that plays hipster music and is frequented by hipsters who like hipster beer and hipster food at hipster prices. To be fair, the food, craft beer, coffee and bread (Josey Baker bread) are great.  Every evening from 6-9 (except first Monday of every month) they serve you pizza by the slice. One seasonal veggie and another classic cheese slice. It's a pretty big slice for $3.50 (plus taxes) and you can tell it has high quality ingredients.  The magic is in the dough, which is baked perfectly, light, airy, crisp and salty (think tiny chunks of salt that hit your palette as you bite the crust).  I usually get it to go, and I reheat it at 450 until the cheese starts to boil a wee bit. And voila, it's ready to be gone in 60 seconds.  If you are craving a slice, without breaking the bank or your daily calorie budget, this is the place to be in the evening. You can usually find a spot on weekday evenings, and get your slice within 3 minutes.  The toppings can be from onion and mushroom to 4 cheese (quattro formaggi) to something ungodly such as pineapple and jalapeño (sounds better than it tastes).  Try this pizza for the dough. Also it's not gooey or overflowing with oil. So you won't feel tres guilty. If you want to balance it out, they also have a salad (7 bucks I think) that can make you justify that delicious slice."
The Mill,"The Mill is everything I dream of in a coffee shop — atmosphere, warmth, good coffee, great food and pastry options. I wish COVID  was over so I could sit inside and write /people watch. Can’t wait to go back!"
The Mill,The toast was fantastic and the coffee was deliciously above average! I will definitely go again!
The Mill,"Nice place, lots of space. Very hipster. Coffee was good but not great, same goes for the employees taking your order. Therefore I feel the prices are a too high. Also no wifi.."
The Mill,As brilliant as expected - second home in SF
The Mill,Great ambiance. But everything is way over priced. I bought a loaf of multigrain bread there once and it was not cooked through. It seems like expired yeast was used or something. Huge waste of $7.
The Mill,"$4 toast, you say? Isn't that a little ridiculous? Yes, yes it is. Ridiculous and delicious. I'm apparently a sucker for fancy toast and Four Barrel coffee.  Although, if you're looking for a cafe to hang out and get some work done or have a little chat, this isn't the one. Seating is limited and it's constantly busy."
The Mill,"I wasn't honestly as impressed as I would have liked to be. The nutella toast was ""meh"" and I LOVE nutella. I felt the same about the apricot spread. Moreover, my pour over coffee was disappointing, which for me was the saddest part. I bought 2 loaves of bread to go which I really liked and why I gave it 4 stars. Maybe I just went on an off day, but maybe there's too much hype."
The Mill,Fantastic cortado. Great atmosphere. Actually has some decent seating if you need to get a little work done.
The Mill,"Their toasts and espresso drinks are really good. It's pricey but worth it if you appreciate a good cup of coffee. It's also overly trendy, for better and for worse."
The Mill,"I love the look, layout and feel.  You walk in and immediately I wish I worked there.  The smell of the coffee is  intoxicating and beyond delightful.  The toast are Jam packed with flavor."
The Mill,"Love, love, love.  Great food. Fantastic bread. Wonderful concept. Great coffee. And there is always a collection of trendy, we'll dressed, good looking people at this joint!"
The Mill,"The Mill isn't just doing things right- they are setting the standard.  Josey Baker Bread is the fundamental element to The Mill's daily offerings of toast. Toppings range from cream cheese and black pepper, to honey, maple syrup, or house-made nutella.  Their Four Barrel coffee pairs perfectly. Watch carefully as your barista crafts your drink, because no where else do they have the same care and passion for creating a delicious cup of coffee.  Okay, now I'm hungry and want a mocha and a couple slices of toast."
The Mill,"Good atmosphere, but not a place for Italian espresso. The espresso is too concentrated (too much coffee grind?) and you can't have a regular one, only a double."
The Mill,"All about the cinnamon sugar toast. Great place for coffee, to read, chill. Nice and open space so you can enjoy your coffee without feeling cramped."
The Mill,"Food items: Tea, coffee, coffee beans, toast, jam, almond butter, pastries, and juices always; and pizza after 6pm  Non food items: Pottery, plants, kitchen linens, coffee accessories, tea accessories, kitchen accessories  Seating inside and outside. Hard to find a seat, place is often packed.  Local art decorating the walls  No wifi  ~$5 for a latte ~$7 for toast"
The Mill,"How could toast be so good? It's better than toast should be. It's $4, sure, but it's somehow worth every penny. The coffee from Four Barrel is on point too."
The Mill,"Great bread and lattes! All bread baked in house, which really shows through, and the quality of their coffee is excellent."
The Mill,"Hipster bakery: Yes, there's a record player and vinyl LPs on the shelf to admire as you wait for your thick slab of toast.  We sampled a variety of their special toast concoctions and my favorite included cracked pepper with cream cheese and butter with housemade jam. Yes, you're paying $4 but it's just as much as a pastry and a big portion--its certainly not a slice of dinky Wonder bread. It's artisanal with quality grain."
The Mill,"I'm not a coffee drinker, but come here for their fresh bread which is amazingly yummy! I recommend going off hours since it can get busy on the weekends."
The Mill,"The toast is actually pretty good, if pricey. Not a fan enough to want to stand in the long line during crowded brunchy times. Crowd is trendy/ techy/ banal, may annoy longtime San Franciscans."
The Mill,"The Mill will show you, when it comes to making toast, you're doing it wrong.  Yes, the toast is expensive. Yes, the artisinal staff have the beards, tattoos, and suspenders you'd expect to find at an artisinal coffee & toast shop. But also, yes, the toast is delicious. Worth a visit."
The Mill,"Great coffee, good sandwiches, amazing embience."
The Mill,"This bakery/coffee shop on Divisidero in SF serves up my new favorite coffee, Fourbarrel.  That in itself is enough to make me stop by but then there is their fresh bread.  From which AMAZING and thick slices are toasted and topped to order!  All of that and the fact that they are spinning vinyl records on an old school turntable!  Beach Boys!  Never thought you'd see a place famous for their toast?  This is it!"
The Mill,"Famous when they first opened for $4 Toast. People waited in lines for it. Delicious, and now quintessential SF, so perhaps worth trying once. Best coffee in the area."
The Mill,"My friend took me here for the first time today. Things started out well with me literally parking outside. Inside the staff was great. Me being a seattlite, the coffee here was fantastic.  I had a  cappuccino."
The Mill,"Edit: they seem to ""run out of toast"" really early now. If you want toast, don't bother coming in the afternoon.  Great coffee, great baked goods, great space and atmosphere."
The Mill,"NO wifi, NO toilet, Expensive => NO 2nd time.  Thanks to all the pretentious reviews here, I had the WORST coffee experience in the whole America let alone SF. Should NOT support this kind of business, exploiting the vibe of the neighborhood to prey on consumers!"
The Mill,"We were visiting San Francisco with friends, and of course had to have infamous ""fancy toast""...The Mill fit the bill! Toast, check. Coffee from cute pottery, check. Perfect pristine atmosphere, check."
The Mill,5 stars down to 4 for increasing prices to $14 for toast and coffee. Minus another one for being a coffee shop without wifi. The coffee is good tho and the toast used to be.
The Mill,"Amazing coffee, great atmosphere & service! Would definitely go back only next visit!"
The Mill,"Coffee is locked in and the bakery is a lovely treat to your nose, NO wifi. Vinyl music and the constant order calls keeps a nice vibe."
The Mill,The space is beautiful – I want to come back just to see it again! Coffee was solid and the avocado toast was hearty too.
The Mill,They have some pretty tasty breads and toast options. Decent cappuccino and pleasant staff. It gets a little too noisy for me sometimes tho.
The Mill,"My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. Love the adventure bread. Service is nice, coffee is great."
The Mill,Energy has been weird the last few times I’ve been in. No neighborhood feeling or saying hello. Feels kind of intense and transactional.
The Mill,Black coffee... Tasted great. Staff was super friendly and there is quite a bit of seating. Huge open room and a cool location (Nopa) good for a morning coffee and a walk around.
The Mill,"This is only a review of the Josey Baker bread, which is absolutely delicious. Waits are not tooooo bad (~10 mins) to purchase bread, but expect a longer wait obviously for coffee and prepared foods"
The Mill,"Awesome Four Barrel Coffee, and delicious nutella toast. When you have the coffee in the shop, they heat up the coffee cups with hot water first to bring the temperature of the cup up, before filling the coffee -- that's one of the small but important details to maintain the quality of their coffee. The nutella toast was what initially drew me into the shop -- inch and a half thick cut toast, with a spread of home made nutella -- not too sweet like the original, and a perfect balance with the texture of each bite of the bread. When you're in the NOPA area, come to Josie's aka ""the Mill"""
The Mill,One of the best bakeries and coffee shops in town. The whole wheat sesame and gluten-free adventure bread are both amazing!
The Mill,"The bread is amazing but I ordered a tea, $4.50, and it is the smallest cup of boring tea that tastes like Tetley. They should call it Tiny Tea. It’s seriously a joke. What a total rip."
The Mill,"Here's the secret: Get here before 11am and save more than 800%!! Buy the secret menu item -- a ten-pack of $4 toast for just $6! (some assembly required.) Better yet, buyba bag of Josey's flour stone ground on the eponymous on-site mill and bake your own loaf."
The Mill,"Great collection of breads and baked goods. I'm a fan of the breakfast bar with a bit of jam or apple butter! No wifi so it's a great place to catch up on some reading, people watch, and relax."
The Mill,LOVED this place! Super simple but delicious toasted bread with great ingredients and good coffee. Got the country bread with raspberry spread and butter
The Mill,"Excellent food and coffee delivered in a cool buzzy setting, would 100% revisit next time in the city"
The Mill,"Best Cafe in the neighborhood. Great coffee, amazing pastries, delicious bread, friendly staff. Highly addictive."
The Mill,"if you happen to be strolling the streets of lower haight near Alamo Square around 8am, don't resist the incredible aroma of fresh baked bread and brewing coffee. Best almond milk latte i have EVER had (made w/ Califia farms almond milk).  Not to mention the added bonus of the nicest baristas EVER!!"
The Mill,We met Josey and his wife at The Mill.  They were very nice with us and our 3 year old son.  The service is amazing and the bread fantastik.  Thank you for the great time!
The Mill,Just fabulous. I visit here every time I am in the city. Great coffee and amazing bread.  They have a toast bar that is a real treat.
The Mill,Amazing toast served by the slice. Coffee is good. Great relaxed ambiance and friendly people. A perfect place to linger over the news or a book.
The Mill,No wifi. I would stayed longer and spend more money if it was available. The food was delicious and had fast service.
The Mill,"Super expensive, especially with the almond milk option for espresso drinks.  Toast options and baked goods are okay, but again not for the frugal minded.  No Wi-Fi!, Really?"
The Mill,The food was okay but a bit pricy. It is expected since the city is getting expensive.  The servers were fantastic though so great service so far. I wonder if the experience is different for those in groups of 4?
The Mill,The toast is fantastic! The sesame and poppy seed one has so much flavour and they give you thick pieces too. No Wi-Fi though.
The Mill,"Tasty coffee and expensive but delicious toasts. Yummy bread, excellent atmosphere. Love coming here!"
The Mill,I think the best coffee that I have ever tried. I have been there few tomes during my vacation only to experience it. Steongy recommend because of very friendly staff.
The Mill,Go there if you want to see the SF start up bubble. A piece of rye bread with cream cheese costs $4 + 9% CA tax! Young startup employees browse Craigslist on their Mac book air for $4000/mo two bedroom apartments in the Dog Patch. Recommended for tourists before the bubble bursts.
The Mill,Visited here on holiday (from Australia). Coffee and feel reminded me of home. Nice local style place. There was a market on across the road the day we were there too which added a nice touch. Recommended
The Mill,Nice spot for coffee! Delicious Avacado Toast!
The Mill,Amazing bread at this place. I could just eat their bread and butter and cheese all day. Good mocha as well
The Mill,A cool spot for neighbors and tourists alike.  The tall ceilings n light colors create a relaxing ambience for everyone.  And the outside parklet is super when the weather cooperates.
The Mill,"Great drinks, tasty bread, super friendly staff. No wifi, somewhat intense music."
The Mill,"Very tasty breakfast. Their toasts are thick, so with only one you're full. Shame, because i would have had a second one! It's so good!"
The Mill,"Artisanal toast, so you know it's already overpriced, but it's SF, so welcome gentrification! The toast and coffee are great regardless. But no bathroom seat covers? What are you, animals??"
The Mill,"Coffee drinks are well made but aren't cheap. Josie Baker bread is fantastic, but doesn't hit the shelves until about 8am."
The Mill,Such a cool spot and the bread is perfect.
The Mill,"I had the lemon poppy seed bread with almond butter, and it was awesome. Pricey, but awesome. I would definitely stop by here when in the neighborhood."
The Mill,Great customer service! I didn’t know what bread my coworker liked from here so the guy at the front desk offered me their best choice. My coworker loved it!
The Mill,A great place for coffee. Bread is always excellent. The croissants and pastries aren’t as good as they used to be though.
The Mill,"The Divisadero sister establishment to Fourbarrel in the Mission, The Mill focuses on stellar coffee and yummy toast. The toast is around $3, which was recently the focus of an SF Gate article heralding the collapse of collapse of anything affordable in San Francisco. But, it's still just a $3 snack, same as you'd pay at Starbucks for a La Boulange croissant. It's on a pleasant stretch of Divisadero, not far from Rare Device and the new Bi Rite."
The Mill,"Great bread, coffee and toasts."
The Mill,"It is mind blowing for toast, but I wouldn't say it is mind blowing in general. And of course a little expensive for the amount of food, but not for the quality. Iced mocha just tasted like milk"
The Mill,Great coffee! Upgraded the toast to the adventure bread and it didn't disappoint. Worth a side trip for sure.
The Mill,Coffee is delicious and the staff is friendly. I haven't had the baked goods yet but the bread looks great.
The Mill,"Get the bread! It's so fresh and sooo good. The coffee is not my preferred cup, but the atmosphere, music, and staff make up for it."
The Mill,"Amazing coffee and bread/baked goods. Would be 5 stars, but 5.75 for a mocha (even though it's one of the best) is too much."
The Mill,Such good toast and the olive oil and tea cake amazing !
The Mill,Great brunch spot with amazing bread and cafe drinks. Make sure to leave with a loaf of the house bread. There are long lines on the weekend so try to go early.
The Mill,"Delicious toast, decent espresso based coffee and cool space, it's something you should try. Downside is it's a little pricey for toast and you need to serve yourself."
The Mill,"Beautiful coffee, friendly and attractive staff. If only the artisan toast weren't so delicious...and didn't cost $4 a slice 😂 …"
The Mill,"Cafe food at this place - yummy. Entered near nine, it wasn't busy. The staff was helpful and kind. I see why this place has so many great reviews."
The Mill,"Insanely overpriced toast. Everyone's raving about the bread, but as a German: meh. Great coffee though. Also, a ton of unbearable tech hipster wannabes."
The Mill,"Came here for an art show, good work supporting local art! Prices are fair, pizza is... unique, not bad just not what I normally expect. Worth a stop by!"
The Mill,"Fantastic avacado toast, really yummy on The Mill's delicious bread. The coffee was good too, but this place is about the bread."
The Mill,I like this place until I remember I'm about to wait too long to pay too much for a piece of (albeit tasty) toast.  Then I go elsewhere and enjoy an entire loaf of tasty bread and jar of lemon curd.
The Mill,The people here are very kind. They want you to be satisfied with your purchase. We bought some country bread with an americano. It was great.
The Mill,Cute cafe! Friendly staff. Also they have oat milk!
The Mill,Only one gluten-free option of a muffin for my wife. I still love this place and it is a must if you like good coffee and toast.
The Mill,I love everything about this place  Except when my favorite bread is sold out 😤 …
The Mill,"5 stars for the pizza that's served after 6pm every night. If ya know, ya know. We can't get enough of it! Every pizza lover must try."
The Mill,Great coffee and atmosphere.  A mix between a walk up coffee place and a cafe.  Just had the coffee and it was pretty good.  Not like mercury coffee in Seattle.
The Mill,Amazing bread. I always get the country loaf and an americano and leave very happy.
The Mill,"Great bread. We took it home to eat with stinky cheese, fig preserves and fruit. The neighborhood is a nice area to wander around in."
The Mill,One of few places in the city that offers genuinely good toast. Gets busy but plenty of space so you can usually find a seat
The Mill,"Overpriced food and coffee, with a Google Bus, yuppie crowd fresh in from Orange County. If you have lived in SF for more than 3 years you'll want to avoid this place for sure. Go to Oasis instead."
The Mill,Cappuccino and the lemon Ricotta with jam today was great! Can't wait to go back
The Mill,Their adventure bread is insanely good. Their pizza (a new seasonal option each week) and salad are also pretty solid.
The Mill,"Great coffee, great bread. Don't need to wait till 5 pm top get your trainer bread fix. This b bread is as good"
The Mill,Nice environment. Coffee and toast are a plus even if pricey. Known for their bread and worth buying a loaf for later.
The Mill,Now that's how you do toast!
The Mill,Not a lot of seating but the staff is always friendly and the coffee is great. Really nice decor and ambiance. I always stop by when I'm in the area.
The Mill,Do you like fancy toasts and good coffee? I think you might like this place. beautiful interiors combined with the smell of baking bread will have you hooked.
The Mill,Great coffee and absolutely delicious fresh baked bread. The croissants and treats were amazing too.
The Mill,"While we were eating our $7 toast by the window, a homeless man pushing a shopping cart walked right by. Seemed appropriate given where we were. Worth trying!"
The Mill,Visited from NYC and LOVED their cold coffee! The place is also super cute and staff is very friendly.
The Mill,"Art on the walls, hot chocolate made from real chocolate, lots of places to sit."
The Mill,"Delicious Josey Baker bread. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Pick up freshly made bread to go or dine in for served toast and coffee. Yum!"
The Mill,High quality coffee and bread. Minus 1 star for value - the avocado toast is amazing but it'll cost you $8
The Mill,"Great coffee. In my opinion the toasts are a bit to pricy. Ambience nice, staff friendly."
The Mill,"I love the Mill for its coffee & its super cool, Instagrammable aesthetic, but its consistent lack of seating & over-hyped toasts force me to pull a star from the rating."
The Mill,Their pizza crust is amazing. Love their pizza in general since it is vegetarian. There aren't always great seating options though.
The Mill,Have been coming here for 8 years and I’m still convinced that their sourdough boule of seed feast is the perfect loaf of bread.
The Mill,"It's not about the bleepin' toast!! Its the COFFEE, the LOCATION, the cool staff, it's roomy/cool atmosphere and high tables.  Duh."
The Mill,Came all the way here based on the photos but the prices shown on the menus in the pictures at least for what I wanted to order have been doubled.
The Mill,"Great way to start you day, grab a cup of four barrel coffee and avocado on toast. One of the best coffee in San Francisco."
The Mill,Great coffee and egg in the hole dish.
The Mill,"It's great when it's quiet, but it does get pretty loud when busy. The bread is excellent and the coffee pretty good."
The Mill,"Great, fresh baked toast with a variety of toppings. Four Barrel coffee also available."
The Mill,Amazing toast and coffee. Delicious assortment of fresh baked bread available to buy and take home. Beautiful space.
The Mill,"Definitely isn't a $, it's a fancy $$-$$$. Very beautiful interior, but sorry, in my opinion fits more in the marina than the NOPA area, too many yuppies/tech $$ hipsters. The divisadero NOPA area is sort of disappeared, and nothing close to what it always was anymore."
The Mill,"Pizza had good, dense, salty crust."
The Mill,Nice vibe
The Mill,"Four barrel coffee joint. Friendly barristas, really lively white tile decor. Can definitely see this place becoming a neighborhood favorite."
The Mill,Not a place to work in. No electricity plugs no internet and very loud. A very good place for hang out though
The Mill,Coffee is very fresh and bread looks great. But breads are placed next to restroom without any cover!
The Mill,Not bad and food is terrific
The Mill,I just paid $7 for a slice of toast and I had to clear away my own plate. The toast was fine. What an experience!

The Mill,"The food and coffee is solid. The space is bright and modern, and staff are friendly. The only thing to watch out for is the queue!"

The Mill,Food is delicious and fresh. Coffee is great. First come first serve with the tables. Cafe always packed.
The Mill,Cool environment and a good service with a nice coffee. Only minor detail is that there are no electricity spots to charge the notebook.
The Mill,"Great breads and pizzas! Very cool vibe as well. Food is very hearty, so recommend under ordering!"
The Mill,"It is really hard to justify a $6 toast, but at the same time this is probably the only $6 toast that comes close to justifying. It is definitely worth the splurg if you can!"
The Mill,Best fresh bread in the city.
The Mill,"Lovely Spot, great coffee, they sell good bread too!"
The Mill,The salmon toast and avocado toasts rock!!! Four barrel coffee yum!
The Mill,Pizza on Monday nights gives me a reason to look forward to Mondays. Also can't wait to try the Buffalo  ice cream affogato!

The Mill,"Went for pizza Monday. Food was good.  Byob is awesome, but if you hate hipsters stay away."
The Mill,I am religious about the Mountain Rye and love I can get it at Rainbow Grocery because they sell out of loaves fast here!
The Mill,The space is very cool and the staff is great. The pizza was a little burnt and not quite what was expected. Maybe it was an off day...

The Mill,"It is a gourmet cafe near Alamo Square. As a coffee lover, this was the most delicious cafe latte I had during my trip to San Fran. This is a shop that deserves a higher rating. The milk is very soft, and the coffee is moderately nutty and has a deep flavor. Recommended for takeout when going to Alamo Square"
The Mill,"Bakery and cafe located in San Francisco, California, USA. As the name suggests, they make their own bread from the flour itself and bake and sell it.  It seems that baking work is still going on in the back loft in a large and wide open space. There are several food menus using bread. Ordered avocado toast and cinnamon sugar. It's avocado toast, which is a common menu in California, but the kick is to sprinkle Maldon salt on top. It is also sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, which enhances the umami taste. The bread underneath is called country bread, similar to rye bread.  For coffee, I use Dongne's Four Barrel Coffee. It has a rich coffee aroma, probably because it has just been roasted, and the latte taste is better due to the slight acidity. The atmosphere itself is just California."
The Mill,"A popular cafe opened by the popular San Francisco coffee chain FOURBARREL COFFEE with Josey Baker Bread. The coffee is of course delicious, but the selling point here is the bread baked in the back of the store. It is standard to order toast and coffee with various original tastes such as DARK MOUNTAIN RYE (cream cheese + black pepper + sea salt) using that bread. The clerk was also very friendly."
The Mill,"The bakery cafe near Alamo Square is famous, so there are many visitors, and simple brunch like toast is good."
The Mill,"I loved this coffee place in San Francisco! It has style, the coffee was great, strong and black (as it should =)!! It's self service, you have some tables where you can work too. The chocolate cookie was great too.  I loved this cafe in San Francisco! It has style, the coffee is delicious, strong and black (as it should =)!! It is self-service, you have some tables where you can also work. The chocolate cookie is very good too."
The Mill,"It's kind, and the Americano and latte are so delicious that I ordered an additional coffee and bought some beans. It was a pity that I chose the wrong menu for toast, but the bread was delicious! Lemon ricotta toast is not recommended."
The Mill,"It's so hard to get a seat when you eat alone. I ordered a cappuccino for menu number 3, but the toast itself was a little salty, but the salt was on top, so it was salty. Still, I had a good meal :) Cappuccino was also JMT"
The Mill,"I don't know if the bread itself is salty or if it's sprinkled with salt, but the cinnamon tastes good, the avocado and lemon make it refreshing, and the eggs are just plain... Cinnamon tastes the best. The coffee was also okay and delicious!"
The Mill,Great place! Short menu and delicious bread. I recommend
The Mill,"Friendly service and a nice open atmosphere ensure the feel-good factor. As a passionate coffee lover, I can recommend the coffee latte, which is absolutely great and has an incredibly good aroma. I can also highly recommend the blueberry muffins with sunflower seeds. All products, whether bread or coffee, are made here by hand and are of high quality. Hence my very best recommendation for this coffee lounge in San Francisco."
The Mill,"It was so delicious. It's a pity that I only went once. I ate cream cheese pesto toast, but I'm curious about other toasts too"
The Mill,"Very rich everything! A perfect place to have a coffee, do some work on your Mac or go talk to someone."
The Mill,"You can simply eat toast and coffee, and bakeries are also sold. Even though I visited on a weekday, there were no seats every time I went. There are five or six types of toast, and the toast base, the bread, also varies depending on what goes on top. They even sell pizza in the evening. A good place to go alone or together"
The Mill,"I found out that it is a bakery and brews coffee with fourbarrel coffee beans. Lattes and coffee are delicious, but this area is located on a hill, and the scenery is outstanding, making it a wonderful place to live. Supermarkets and restaurants nearby are also very good."
The Mill,"Quite an impressive place, there is no signage from the outside, so if you just look at the map and find it, ""Is this right?"" However, when you go inside, there is a large space and tables, and many people are eating brunch. For brunch, thick toast bread is covered with fruit jam, avocado, brown sugar syrup, etc., and it is hot and delicious because it is freshly baked. Personally, the avocado toast was the most delicious. Art pieces made of geometric shapes are consistently hung on the walls, which goes well with the atmosphere of the store."
The Mill,"From the moment you walk in and see that there are a lot of them you know that it is a popular option, I had the opportunity to eat a croissant which was delicious and also the chocolate. It does not reach 5 stars because I thought the American coffee had a not very pleasant taste."
The Mill,Excellent homemade almond milk and cashew hot chocolate and very good toast. Their homemade jam is to die for! Large comfortable space and super friendly staff
The Mill,"All very good, the toast with avocado and egg are excellent. Excellent bread!"
The Mill,"To be honest, I ordered Americano and hot chocolate here and ate it. There were a lot of people when we went, but not many people, and we were able to get a seat. And Americano is tasteless. I think it tastes good to foreigners. Hot chocolate was tasteless, even though it's the kind that can't be tasted in the real world. However, it was nice to feel the atmosphere in front of that unique American university town."
The Mill,A cafe full of real local and hip atmosphere Make sure to taste at least one toast made with homemade bread.
The Mill,delicious latte. Toast feels expensive
The Mill,"If there is a toast artisan, this is the place. The nonchalant yet chic atmosphere is a bonus"
The Mill,"You can work and just run for coffee, and buy fresh bread, and have a snack👌🏼"
The Mill,"A cafe with a nice atmosphere. There are many locals and it is popular, so there are vacant seats There were few 😔 The toast was cute, but expensive and a bit hard..🤔 A place that remains as a good memory!"
The Mill,"A nice cafe. Be careful, however, it is quickly full at the end of the afternoon. There is a wide choice of coffee and some teas. By counting only one ice tea. They have pastries and also bake their bread on site."
The Mill,"Excellent both in quality and in service, young people who get their hands dirty!!!"
The Mill,Nice place and delicious toasts. Unfortunately very expensive.
The Mill,A cafe with delicious orange juice and pizza!
The Mill,"Very good, I recommend it."
The Mill,"It's a coffee shop, but it was hard to choose because there were so many delicious breads right out of the oven. It seems like a place where locals visit rather than tourists. It's close to Alamo Square."
The Mill,Then here is a restaurant that only prepares a few things but prepares them very well. These days the price has gone up so now you will pay 4.5 dollars for one slice of pizza. The price is high and you are also paying for a very hipster environment. Pizza is starting to see.
The Mill,"The atmosphere is nice and comfortable, the toast is good, but I make it myself, the price of about $5-8 per toast is a bit expensive, but considering the overall atmosphere, it's okay"
The Mill,bakery and coffee shop. The bread looks wonderful. The cappucino is delicious. Good music. Nice people. Mega👍👍👍👍👍
The Mill,"One of those fantastic toasts, a coffee - and a great start to the day - great shop in the Haight-Ashbury area; definitely go!"
The Mill,"Rather nice American café bar, the service is not the best but the atmosphere is good and studious."
The Mill,"Atmosphere good. It is a memorable cafe in San Fran. The toast is vegan, so it's tasteless.."
The Mill,"cafe and bakery - I was here for breakfast I had a cappuccino and cake, friendly service, great place for group breakfasts or events"
The Mill,Delicious toast and four barrel coffee
The Mill,"The coffee is really delicious, the food too and the atmosphere is very cozy. Highly recommended!!!"
The Mill,Super baker with own production. Very good Italian coffee.
The Mill,"I ate chocolate hazelnut toast, but the bread itself is better than the cream on top."
The Mill,One of our best cappuccino and mocha from our west coast road trip. Pastries to die for 👍🏻
