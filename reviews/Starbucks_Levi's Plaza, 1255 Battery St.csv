Starbucks,Friendly barista.  Comfortable seating.
Starbucks,The Greatest Starbucks I Have Been To In San Francisco.... Friendly Place... CozY.....🐈‍⬛😷🌉
Starbucks,Friendly workers! Great coffee! Timely with the orders. One of the best locations!
Starbucks,Hi there! We're so glad you had a wonderful experience. Thanks for sharing it with us!
Starbucks,Terrible service. The cashier would not let me order a Smores frappuccino even though it is clearly listed on their menu. She told me the only frappuccinos I could order are the ones in the picture to the right. Please remove the other 5 frappuccinos from the menu if they are not available.
Starbucks,"Amazing staff, great location nearly remodeled"
Starbucks,First time in San Fran for me and first Starbucks I patronized. The food took a little longer to come out than I'm used to back home but everything else was great as expected with the Starbucks brand.
Starbucks,Spacious and modem looking establishment.  Very friendly staff.  Consistent product quality.
Starbucks,"They did not give me what i asked for. I asked for a chocolate croissant and a grande mocha frap with cinnamon powder blended. The employees gave me a butter croissant while charging me for chocolate (even after i saw the wrong croissant go in the toaster and informed the employee that a correction needed to be made), they put too much chocolate syrup in the mocha (basically tasted like a chocolate syrup slushie), and the cinnamon powder was not blended. Very disappointed with my trip. Employees should get orders right and not overcharge customers for a mistake. I will not be returning here again."
Starbucks,"The Starbucks location on California and Kearny offers standard items, but the stand out of the store is customer service. The afternoon staff are super friendly even under noticable pressure from the long lines. The store has very interesting mugs and coffee items. The seating area is always full. This is the only negative I noticed."
Starbucks,"Clean and bright! I needed to rush to the bathroom before ordering - bathrooms weren't locked, and no one batted an eye. Friendly and prompt employees."
Starbucks,"A week after closing the nearby Starbucks at Sansome and Halleck Alley, this Starbucks has to give out refunds to mobile order customers because they can’t keep up with demand.  Time to try Peet’s."
Starbucks,"Great service, relaxed environment on the pier. A peaceful visually spectacular respite for a tired tourist and a great finish to a long workday waiting for the ferry home."
Starbucks,"Ordered a small cappuccino and it’s the worst one I have ever drank. It’s the person who made it, she was busy talking to colleague and hardly did anything with milk, tasted raw cold milk , just threw it after a sip."
Starbucks,"It's an ok Starbucks. One half of food order was cold and needed to be reheated, several chairs had rips in them.  Coffee was fine."
Starbucks,They closed an hour early. we were very Cold and needed warmth. Didn't happen shame on you Starbucks bad business practices.
Starbucks,"Kind of an odd and dark bathroom setup, (not a single light on had to use the little bit of natural light coming in from the large front window) but it was clean and fast service."
Starbucks,Best Starbucks within a few blocks - super fast mobile ordering & really nice staff!
Starbucks,"I never use Starbucks and I suggest that others do NOT either. Starbucks robs the workers by training their workers to have only Starbucks in mind and body. I could go on but this app doesn't have the space for it, here and now."
Starbucks,"Great location, not enough seating though. Friendly staff. Parking would be difficult nearby."
Starbucks,"Probably could use a bit more seating but spacious, clean and fully stocked at 4:30am.  Fast baristas"
Starbucks,Dark inside. Didn't get my order right and didn't offer to remake it.  😕 …
