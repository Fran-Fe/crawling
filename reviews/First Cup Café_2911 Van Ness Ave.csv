First Cup Café,First time going I tried their chocolate croissant it is actual Nutella really good I'd highly recommend for croissant in the future I plan to go back and get some more of their food
First Cup Café,"Run by nice people, but my latte had a burnt flavor, and my bacon, egg and cheese bagel was just fine.  They also don't have indoor seating available which was disappointing given the photos and rainy day outside. Not a bad place, but also not a 4.5 (current rating)"
First Cup Café,"Cute mom and pop cafe with delicious hot taro lattes and bagel sandwiches. FYI There's no seating so you gotta take it to go. Also, they close pretty early, so you gotta stop by in the morning/lunchtime."
First Cup Café,It’s a small place. We went there by chance for breakfast. In a windy day the most comfortable drink for me is to have a chai latte. Their chai latte and Korean BBQ sandwich were very delicious than my expectation.
First Cup Café,"Fast service, hearty and fresh breakfast sandwiches, somewhat unimpressive coffee in a nice hole in the wall more suited to takeout."
First Cup Café,Cute little café with great breakfast bagels! Would love to go back and try their sandwiches
First Cup Café,"Great place to get some bagels & coffee. Fair prices, friendly owners. I highly recommend the ""avocado with everything"" - amazing. The ""avocado with cream cheese"" bagel was also delicious. Compared to other, more fancy bagel shops - you get a lot of Bagel for a fair amount of money"
First Cup Café,"It was a pleasure having First Cup Cafe right next to the place I was staying at during my visit to San Francisco. Their Colombian roast is incredibly tasty and so is their Korean bbq sandwich. I also got to try their bagels, namely their everything bagel with lox which I thought was good and had good portions. In a nutshell, this is an incredibly good place to start your day without having to spend a ton of money."
First Cup Café,Very delicious Bagel Sandwich 👍🏻 …

First Cup Café,"Hot Korean BBQ sandwich on a whole wheat roll, an excellent double latte, .#iLoveFirstCupCafe"
First Cup Café,"Good for quick, inexpensive bite to go, for breakfast or lunch. Homemade croissants  (plain, chocolate, ham & cheese) and assorted pastries, and yummy Korean BBQ sandwich. Open daily around 6:45 or 7 am, close in early afternoon. Closed on Sundays."
First Cup Café,Ham & Cheese Croissants are to die for! The rest of the pastries are all home made and excellent! Wonderful family owned quick bites for coffee and breakfast / lunch!

First Cup Café,"Tiny place but enough to have a coffee and something for breakfast. We ordered some baggels and they make them for you at the moment, they also had ham and cheese Neapolitans, chocolate, some cookies... not much but all good. It is run by a family. They always have coffee made in huge thermoses. People were coming in, they got the coffee they wanted, paid and continued marxa. There are a couple of tables to have breakfast there."
First Cup Café,"You're kind. The sandwich was delicious, but the juice you squeezed was so delicious!"
First Cup Café,"This cafe was right in front of the bus stop where I was waiting to take the bus to the Golden Gate Bridge. A Korean couple is running it. I was thirsty and wanted to have a cup of coffee, so I unexpectedly met curry rice and jajang rice at a cafe. Other fried chicken? There were the same ones, and there are four in total, so put them on top of rice like a bowl of rice. I missed Korean food so much in the US that I didn't usually eat it, but it was so delicious. The price was also cheap. compared to US prices. I ate very well at a reasonable price, and the smoothies sold there are also delicious."
