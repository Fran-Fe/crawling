Blue Bottle Coffee,"The Blue Bottle Coffee chain has a nice, clean interior design and a good selection of beverages. The food is mostly on the sweet side, with more cakes and croissants on offer. We have tried Blue Bottle Coffee in various locations, and this is a nice outlet. We enjoyed double espresso macchiato, ice coffee, and cappucino. All the coffees were excellent, and the staff was friendly and correct. Prices are average for this type of cafe and this type of coffee. We didn‘t try any of the sweet food options."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Always liked Blue Bottle for its sleek, clean design and ability to not complicate coffee. My order here is always a double espresso (Hayes Valley) and as I always say, if you don’t get served water with the espresso—don’t take it seriously!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I went here for coffee break. I ordered the green tea latte. It was plain, but then i added syrup. It taste good. Services were good. Good for small meeting and friends.  CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The customer service here is out of this world! The friendliest people I've met. Thank you for the excellent service and just being so kind! Love Blue Bottle and the love it brings into the world!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Had the worst customer service experience ever from Blue bottle on July 16th, Sunday afternoon. When I was picking up my drink I wanted to confirm that its decaf. I asked the barista, but I couldn’t hear him at all because he was wearing a mask. So I asked him again and he scowled at me and yelled “yes” in disturbing tone. I’m sure anyone could have a bad day but he was giggling and having fun with other coworkers right after I talked to him. So he was just throwing a tantrum at me. He’s asian, tall, and has black hair. (I’m asian too…) Train the staffs and improve your service. No one wants to experience such an attitude."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks! "
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Been to plenty of Blue Bottle in the City (and around the world), this is the by far the worst location in terms of service. It’s really a shame, nice ambiance is ruin by abysmal hospitality. Condiment table lack maintenance and no one bothers to refill. Was wondering why the store is empty on Sunday morning. SERVICE MATTERS."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thank you for sharing this! Will you email us with more info at support@bluebottlecoffee.com?"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I recently tried Blue Bottle coffee, and I was super impressed with the quality. First of all, the coffee was incredibly smooth and flavorful, with a strong and balanced flavor. The beans were roasted perfectly, and the coffee was overall incredibly delicious. Additionally, the customer service was great! I felt like they really cared about making sure I had a good experience. I would highly recommend Blue Bottle coffee to anyone looking for an amazing cup of coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"We have come to this location several times and the service has been subpar on several occasions. When taking orders, several of the cashiers did not greet nor acknowledge us- not saying a word while we ordered.  I have also seen on one occassion, an employee raising their voice at a customer who did not speak english well- who was asking questions about the menu.  Coffee is good, food is good, service is less than average at this location."

Blue Bottle Coffee,"Food and coffee is amazing, but the employees’ attitude is the worst. It was 4:51pm, we wanted to use the restroom, and because they cleaned it already, they didn’t let us use. My blatter is literally hurting and I couldn’t use the restroom. This is ridiculous, and honestly an attitude I don’t expect from any person who has a little bit of humanity. Unbelievable!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"6/3/23 at 4:20pm.. 30 minutes prior to closing. I asked the person taking orders if the bathroom was open and he said no the bathroom is not available bc they’re closing soon.  But when I asked the person making the coffee, she told me the code.  Please make that make sense because it’s not like it’s five minutes before closing!! 🤷🏻‍♀️"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Clean and spacious be blue bottle. Delicious coffee and nice space. They confused what an espresso macchiato is with ... a latte i think but upon complaint immediately fixed it and redid it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The staff was nice. Tried the matcha drink, but it was not the best. Unfortunately there was a homeless man outside who kept looking inside the store through the windows."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"One of my new favorite Blue Bottle cafes in town. Beautiful space, central location, great coffee and menu. Highly recommend ✌🏼🥑☕️"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This spot is ok.  But I think it's really not worth the money. I got a 12oz latte and a plain croissant for breakfast and it was more than 12 bucks. I dunno, it wasn't bad or anything. I just feel like it was expensive for something rather mundane."
Blue Bottle Coffee,It’s a bright airy place to grab some excellent coffee. Staff are very friendly. Baked goods are yummy as well
Blue Bottle Coffee,In a very quiet neighborhood. We went Sunday 11:00am and there were only three people. You can sit and work/read/chill quietly here.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"02/05/23, 11AM Walk in, 4 staff messing around behind the counter not serving anyone. Fat loud girl (most useless of the staff) shouting her head off with her nauseating nasal voice. Floors and tables a mess.  15:20: line of 7 people including myself waiting to get served, suddenly there’s only one person to serve and make coffee. In the 15 minutes of waiting to pay for my pre-made boxed coffee, two of the other 4 tontos come out and then walk back leaving just the one person to make and serve coffee for 7 people.  They clearly don’t care about their jobs, and should be sacked immediately."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"If you're looking for the most consistent barisita experience when it comes to quality lattes, Blue Bottle never disappoints. If you want to skip the line, they have a great app!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The staff was friendly, avocado toast was good size and iced latte was delicious. The store is in a quiet neighborhood, residing in a lovely red brick building. There are plenty of seating inside and a couple of tables outside. I really enjoyed my visit there. This just might be my favorite Blue Bottle location in SF!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I always love a cup of Blue Bottle coffee! Stopped by on a drizzly Boxing Day and ordered this Snickerdoodle milk, which the barista kindly informed me was totally non-caffeinated. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that their default milk is now oat milk, which is great news for someone like me, who's been vegan for the last 2 years now!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This 5 star review is for their best barista Debra! She is makes the best coffee and always very helpful! She is the reason i come this location, i been drinking coffee for a while and her coffee are always has the best notes."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This was my go to coffee spot while visiting San Fran, right around the corner from my hotel. The staff were friendly & fun. The barista (can't recall his name) even took the time to demonstrate his latte art...tips and tricks. Will visit again next time in town."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The people here are really nice. A guy with a hat helped me pick out some great coffee for my fam.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Aesthetics of a surgical operating room ; I felt I had been wheeled onto a gurney and deposited here for a kidney transplant ; service is robotic as befits a hospital.  But it’s a great looking place from outside as the building itself lends this cafe a warmth which it does not possess on its own.  I did venture to the cafe last week; it’s coffee and service was good. Won’t let you use bathroom unless you  are a client; so you pay 6 bucks to pee.  Try asking for sugar ; it’s not free because it’s been frozen for a billion years and it’s so special
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The coffee is always on point.. but the service is terrible. There was no “hello” “ good morning” when I was called.. the girl with short black hair just looked at me ..so I walked over and I order a blend box coffee bean.. she was like: “ what?” I said I want a blend box.. she asked her colleague to help her as she doesn’t know what’s going on… And when I order coffee and pastry.. she just give me the attitude that she doesn’t want to work there…
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Crystal, glad you got in touch and sorry fo the trouble. Please reach out to us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com for further assistance. Thanks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Not recommended.  Hipster kinda thing. People go for the hype. Decent, but not good coffee.  Can try but don't expect amazing coffee for the high price paid."
Blue Bottle Coffee,nice coffee and warm staff
Blue Bottle Coffee,Excellent Coffee and Avocado Toast. But asian looking lady (with black skater hat) has an extreme attitude and is VERY unfriendly. SAD !
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh dear, we're so sad to hear this! Can you reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I'm here for the first time and I do like the coffee here, the atmosphere here is calm service is absolutely best in one word Perfect. Thanks Blue Bottle Coffee"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I had a terrible experience in this location yesterday. I went there a little after 4 pm. I asked for a Three Africas pour over. The cashier said ""The Poor Over"" is out for the day (This store closes at 5 pm). However, I can see clearly that the cups and filters are waiting to be used on the counter two inches away from me. She suggested an Americano which tested so watery. I have been going to Blue Bottle since they opened the Hayes Valley Kiosk in 2005. Very disappointed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great place to sit and do work/study. There was a lot of open seating available on the weekend. Since it is in the city, parking is somewhat difficult to find without paying too much. There is free wifi available, but there weren't any outlets to charge."
Blue Bottle Coffee,This was honestly one of the worst Americanos I’ve ever had. It was incredibly weak and the grind was clearly off.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Nothing is worse than a cold coffee that was supposed to be hot. Too much attitude on details while they just can’t sell a “hot” coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee house experience!!  Food is amaze!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Stop by for a coffee, wasn’t expected to an amazing place and welcoming friendly service. Was planning to stay for 5 mins, ended up with 40 mins to enjoy the place and atmosphere here. Coffee was as good as usual:)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"12oz. New Orleans w/Oat Milk. Indoor seating, friendly staff and a public restroom (never used). I think the longest I’ve seen the line is 5 people, usually in and out in 1 minute"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee and location but very rude staff. I have visited several blue bottle locations and never had this experience
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Poor service, burnt coffee and my 8$ half sandwich was chewy as though it had been sitting out since yesterday. Blue bottle can do so much better."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Can’t ask for better coffee in SF. Have to stop by every time I am in the city. Not a lot of space to work right now; however, definitely worth the take out."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good quality coffee and comfy environment
Blue Bottle Coffee,So glad we have a Blue Bottle close to North Beach now. Happy that it’s open daily too. Great coffee as always!

Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"

Blue Bottle Coffee,Great place to grab a coffee and take a meeting in the area
Blue Bottle Coffee,I always stop by this location when I'm in the area. Great espresso and usually not busy
Blue Bottle Coffee,Way too long of a wait time for a pour over. Total of 15 minutes of waste!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!  "
