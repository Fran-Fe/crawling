Starbucks,"As I stepped into the coffee sanctuary, I felt a deep longing for a drink that could power me through the day. And lo and behold, I found the holy grail of coffee beverages - the Iced Caramel Macchiato - QUAD style! With every sip, I experienced an electrifying rush that emboldened me to take on any challenge. This divine concoction was a true game-changer, and I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the ingenious team who crafted it. Your talent and creativity are simply awe-inspiring!"
Starbucks,"I was treated like an inconvenience. The batista did ask if I wanted dark roast or regular but didn't ask if I wanted any cream or sugar. When I asked for it she acted like I had grown a second head. She basically made me feel unwelcomed, like she would have preferred I hadn't come in at all. I get that the morning shift is rough, so I was willing to let it all slide but what really pushed me over the edge is how her attitude changed entirely for the older woman who was dressed slightly nicer than me came in. I won't be coming back to this location, and will just wait for the Peet's across the street to open to get my morning coffee from now on. I genuinely don't care what happens as a result of this review. I hope the General Manager reads it and has a discussion with his batista about customer service, but it'll probably be ignored."
Starbucks,"i am a regular customer to buy drinks in SB.  I bought in many different SB stores with the same drink (mocha cookie crumble frappuchino. Sub white mocha).  I've bought it in this shop twice and now it's the 3rd time. This time I was really disappointed because the drink I ordered was not the same as the last time they made it for me and of course it tasted different.  .  I remember the frappuchino  it had to have cream, mocha sauce and cookie crumble on the bottom of the cup but they didn't do that, just cream and oreo on top.  I do not know why?   sad and disappointing."
Starbucks,I go in almost every morning after my shift on my way home to get a frappuccino..  I'm addicted what can I say?  That and the service of one of their employees always leaves me feeling emotionally erect...🤪
Starbucks,Store opened 20 minutes late. No sense advertising an opening time that the staff are not committed to. Large number of homeless people hanging around. Felt dangerous.
Starbucks,"This Starbucks has hygiene issue.  There are a big broken glass wall at the entrance, and there are lots of flies hanging round on the cookies.... We just walk off after seeing the flies on the cookies and on the beverage maker area."
Starbucks,"I can see why the Starbucks location has such low rating. I came here with my husband and I roommate on the way down to an outing. While hubby decided to go to Peet’s coffee with roommate, I decided to go to Starbucks, someplace I’m familiar with. I should’ve gone to Pete’s with hubby. I ordered my drink, something simple, it took them 15 minutes just for one drink. People were slow as molasses on a cold winters day and from the expression of their faces, they were not happy to be there. There were two people taking orders while one person making the drinks. It was ridiculous as hell. Next time, I’m taking my business to Pete’s.  Price: C Quality: B Service: F"
Starbucks,"Over 3 times here 3 days in a row, all is good here."
Starbucks,Hi there! We're so glad you had a wonderful experience. Thanks for sharing it with us!
Starbucks,A mess. Disorganised like never seen in a Starbucks. Confusion in providing and executing the orders made in big rush at the cashier. Do something to improve this place. Will not come back.
Starbucks,Staff is cool I orders for matcha and don’t liked that they replaced without hesitation and gave me what I have asked which is pumpkin spice latte. Hurray !
Starbucks,I asked for a flat white and my coffee was so milky it was like drinking warm milk. Went back to the shop and made me the same thing. The foam was not properly made! No foam just hot milk in my coffee. If you can choose a different starbucks!
Starbucks,The illuminated sign is falling down.
Starbucks,"Hello! We're grateful that you shared this experience with us. If you're interested, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs) to share any additional feedback. Thank you!"
Starbucks,Service is really slow. One of the baristas is so slow like he had all the time in the world. Gets annoyed when you repeat your order because he didn't hear you.
Starbucks,"Coffee was hot and fast, but I had to wait so long for food. Food handlers looked a little lost and confused. Late too work waiting for my food."
Starbucks,"Friendly and efficient, works together as a team.  Excellent location.  Funky ceiling light above."
Starbucks,Great place to grab an early coffee. Not a lot of places open at 5am so it’s great to see Starbucks on market street cater for people on a different time zone!  Impossible breakfast sandwich is my go to!
Starbucks,Coffee and food is too expensive for the quality.
Starbucks,Quick service as you would expect from any starbucks. My only criticism would be the food did not come out in order. Several people behind me in line received their breakfast sandwiches before I received my warmed up chocolate croissant.
Starbucks,"I really  like their tall cinnamon dolce latte with no whipped cream along with the shortbread. That is a perfect coffee break for me. The environment is great for reading, writing or setting up a meeting  or conference. It's an office away from an office ."
Starbucks,I been going to that Starbucks for couple of yrs already just because it’s across from my job since  couple of weeks ago they have new employees which some of them don’t take you’re order right or just stands next to the microwaves looking around. I like the other employees that were there before.
Starbucks,"There was no line, positive quick service but the coffee was watery. I've had a lot of Starbucks coffee, as many of us can probably say, but today the coffee seemed pretty weak and watery. I've had this one off experience happen quite a few times at Starbucks with various beverages such as mochas, chai lattes, and coffees. I think it is safe to say if I'm buying a cup of coffee I want a bit of security that the drink isn't watered down dampening it's flavor. I am starting to consider just avoiding Starbucks all together for this reason. I have never had this happen with Pete's or local coffee shops. Goodbye Starbucks this was my last straw."
Starbucks,"This tiny Starbucks can easily be missed.  There's very little seating here and there's a slew of homeless who come in here to get sugar packets.  When I come here, it's usually to grab some coffee and not to hang out.  Service here is quick and friendly."
Starbucks,"This maybe the dirtiest Starbucks I’ve been into, maybe they’re too busy to clean. There is one in Wiltshire near DTLA that is a close second. This location also don’t open their restroom to the public, which I’ve never seen. /: I love the convenience & predictability of Starbucks, but when that part is missing, I am likely to find a better solution."
Starbucks,This is one of the worst Starbucks in the city. The unnecessary wait when there is four baristas behind the counter and i am a regular for years now! Unacceptable they will watch you in line and not assist you!!!!
Starbucks,"Starbucks contributes to global deforestation and plastic waste with their overpriced, disposable coffee.  Don't give more money to wasteful, greedy, multinational corporations. Buy at a local coffee shop or make it at home and carry it in a reusable thermos."
Starbucks,"I'm a member of Starbucks. I literally go there 2 times a day. I love the people and the environment. But today, I don't know why the worker there was so rude (the white guy with an accent) he was like: ""I can help who next right here"" and his face was really angry. I was rushing towards him, I didn't want him to wait. And I ask: ""Can I get a grande caramel macchiato, 2 cake pops and a sausage breakfast sandwich?"" then I said:"" can you reload 10$ on my card too? thank you"" (I didn't have any attitude to him) after that he just walk away to get my orders, when he comes back, he said: ""NEXT TIME WHEN YOU ASK ME TO RELOAD YOUR CARD SAY PLEASE"" he stand there doing the order with an attitude. I was shock, didn't know what to say, so I said: ""oh I'm sorry"". I mean I said thank you isn't enough? I just don't get why he get mad it me. I work in retail I don't have an attitude towards customer when I ring them up or when they return stuff. No matter what goes on with your life, when you're at work have a + attitude. Don't pore it on the customers. Ruin my whole day, thanks a lot stranger."
Starbucks,Love my coffee. Service was fast. But i experience a few people asking for change. I dont want to be mean but its too distracting while am enjoying my caffeine.
Starbucks,This Starbucks worked so fast and I got my drink fairly quickly especially since there were so many cups ahead of mine. The staff was nice but the yogurts looked a little old.
Starbucks,"The workers here are petty and lazy. After watching four workers blabber for three minutes about inane topics, I get help. I asked a question about my gold membership and the manager looks super mad and gives me a one word reply while rolling his eyes. Also, I'm the only male in the entire Starbucks sitting at the counter and they yell my name and put my drink out of my reach. It would have been less effort to just hand me the drink."
Starbucks,Disgusting.  Walked in to chaos and fruit flies everywhere.  Walked out without ordering
Starbucks,"Hello, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We pride ourselves on adhering to the greatest standards of cleanliness, so this is disappointing to hear. Please select your preferred method of communication through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs) - we’d love to ensure that this feedback is shared with the appropriate team members. "
Starbucks,"These people are great! Came in feeling a bit down, a Battista named I think Kurt was super cool and got me to leave with a smile on my face.  Thanks"
Starbucks,The coffee tastes great and the only issue I've had is waiting in line but thats because I rush to get coffee during my break time. Staff is nice and they get the coffee out fast.
Starbucks,The worst customer service. I would avoid this location and do to the one that's in the bart station entering the mall.
Starbucks,"Very bad coffee shop,  there was no restroom in it, my little daughter was crying because she wanted to go to restroom. The  order took about 15 minutes as the guy forgot to add it to the system , I was waiting for nothing... bad bad bad experience."
Starbucks,"More of a hole in the wall than most other Starbuck locations, this place have a small exterior footprint and an equally small interior (not many seating options)."
Starbucks,"Horrible service in the mornings.  Employees look like they hate their jobs. Starbucks should retrain all of them. If these young people can't handle a min wage, they will never make it in the real world."
Starbucks,"Had 2x coffee and 2x cheese grill, the service at till was friendly enough but the food was slow to be prepared."
Starbucks,dropped in for a water and the staff was happy to give me a big cup for free because it was so hot out.
Starbucks,The staff is always nice and they move the line along faster than most Starbucks.
Starbucks,It's Starbucks in SF. Why would you go here when there's so many good local places
Starbucks,They always have the perfect drink to hit the spot
Starbucks,"Friendly barista but very under staffed and no drink came out as per order, even after reading the drink requirements on  the side of the cups."
Starbucks,The best place around Market st. if you want to buy Reserved coffee and bring it home. No other Starbucks around have them.
Starbucks,"Stopped in , in a hurry , was not dissatisfied,  my drink came up really quick an was on my way , efficient crew"
Starbucks,"Friendly staff who handle the busy times with great care. Unfortunately, not the nicest interior."
Starbucks,I use the mobile app and my items are always ready when i get there.
Starbucks,Always a long line. Shabby and not clean. Really tiny place which has only 5 seats.
Starbucks,Its pretty tiny and crowded. Not a chill place to grab a coffee with a friend. more like a grab and go kind of place.
Starbucks,"Friendly efficient staff, good location for quick in & out, very few seats"
Starbucks,It is a small store. Very few seats. I hoped to charge my phone but couldn't. There were no power outlets.
Starbucks,Do Starbucks really differ or need reviews? Pretty solid
Starbucks,It was Ok but I woud prefer the one on Grant Ave. or the one in Westfield Center.
Starbucks,Busy but they know how to move a line and get those orders tight!

Starbucks,"This Starbucks was a bit ""dingy"". Ordering was quick and easy. I've often noticed that there are well-managed, i.e. clean Starbucks and a little less ""clean"". So I only give this 2 stars"
Starbucks,Extremely long waiting time and already in the morning there was no more creme cheese. Waiting time also not apparent because many have already ordered and are not in the store. Waiting time for a coffee 20 min
Starbucks,"Too expensive, too long a wait and then the name was spelled wrong. And what are these eco-friendly drinking straws that are sealed after two pulls?"
Starbucks,This place is small. More people enter who buy and continue on their way. The attention is good as in the other places.
Starbucks,The hotel is located near the Grand Canyon. The location is great but I would say quite expensive!
Starbucks,"It is the worst that can be in San Francisco,"
Starbucks,"The coffee and the service is ok, but being in a good area, THERE ARE NO TOILETS!!!!"
