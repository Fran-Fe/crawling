Philz Coffee,"Oh wow! The original Philz coffee has a cool vibe here. Their infamous mint Mojito iced coffee is a must! Super friendly service but the coffee took a longer to make, and there was no other customer in line."
Philz Coffee,"As a Philz Coffee enthusiast, I couldn't resist visiting the OG location in Mission during my trip to SF. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint! While parking can be tricky in this area, we lucked out on a weekday with ample metered street parking. However, weekends in Mission can get busy, so be sure to plan accordingly. Now, let's talk about the coffee. I ordered my go-to, an iced Tesora with creamy oat milk and medium sugar, and it was as delicious as ever. I opted for mobile ordering, and my drink was ready upon my arrival, making for a quick and easy experience. But what really made this visit special was being at the original Philz Coffee location (I believe!). The space was adorned with mural artwork, quirky stickers, mismatched furniture, and stacks of books, giving off an authentic coffee shop vibe. It was a refreshing change of pace from the modernized coffee shops that seem to be popping up everywhere these days. I will definitely be returning to this location and highly recommend it to any coffee lover in the area."
Philz Coffee,The coffee was good. Service slow. Bathroom a little dirty.  Some books and games to borrow is a nice touch.  Overall good but not as great as we were hoping.
Philz Coffee,"Thanks for visiting our location. We are working on making our store better so the feedback is appreciated. Hope next time you visit our Philz, you have a great experience. "
Philz Coffee,"The original Philz. This is worth checking if you are in the neighborhood. Best coffee shop in South Mission area.  I used to come here weekly from 2015-2018. First time back to this location in a couple of years and it has gone downhill a bit. There were no cups by the water station. There were 6 people on staff, but only one making coffee and as a result my coffee took 10-15 minutes to come out. The barista took my card payment before they started my drink (which is opposite of Philz's process). They also had run all out of food by 1:30pm. There were a few posters on the wall that had fallen and the wall tape is still on the wall. Seems like it's a bit more run down.  Overall, the coffee was still good and it has a cool atmosphere with murals on the walls, couches, and plants."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee is delicious but for some reason every time they double lid it, which is impossible to get off. Here's a photo of me just now slicing my finger open trying to get the lid off (lid didn't even come off). I have spilled numerous coffees because of this waste of plastic idiotic practice. I'd rather my coffee spill a little bit at this point. Please stop doing the double lid."
Philz Coffee,So sorry that happened! We got your message are tracking down the issue to make sure that doesn't happen again.  Thank you for letting us know.  We would love for you to come back so we can make you another one! This time without the lid. Next time you come by please ask for the manager. 
Philz Coffee,One of the best coffee. Im from LA but was in SF for the day and wanted to get my morning coffee where Philz started. Jacobs Wonderbar was just as delicious as back at home. Nice to have visited the Original Location. Great service at this location.
Philz Coffee,"I have never been in a Philz before and can't believe I stumbled upon the original location! I got the Silken Splendor pour-over and it was delicious. Very relaxed and chill atmosphere, I plan on going back with my laptop to spend a bit more time there."
Philz Coffee,So good mint coffee and my goal during my stay here in Mission is just trying every menus here 😱😮 I am a coffee animal and yes here is so good to be true with the most chill vibe …
Philz Coffee,"Philz is my favorite coffee shop in Chicago, but the coffee I had at the Mission tastes even better than. I don't know if it's the cream, coffee beans or whatever but this is on another level. The ginger snap, mint mojito and cold brew (Philz way) are all amazing."
Philz Coffee,"Best coffee, I had the Philtered Soul. I got a small cup which is like $5 rounding up. But the finesse of perfect texture of the drink itself alongside the balance of sweet and creamy was something I never tasted before."
Philz Coffee,"The original Philz Coffee Shop, and it's everything and original location should be. Quirky hippies working alongside Millennial professionals, neighborhood grandmas, hipsters, and tourists. As I went up to Lynette to order a large extra strong, extra sweet chai latte, she accommodated my tea and coffee wishes without hesitation, providing stellar, expert service with a smile. Robbie rang me up, and suggested I heat the seven pastries I bought, and asked me if I wanted them cut in half. 10 minutes later, my drinks, warmed pastries, and bagel with spread, salted cucumbers and tomatoes were ready. At $4.75 The Toasted bagel with spread, as described above, was the best value item on the menu. The total with tip, tax, and mandate was $31. $$$ out of $$$$$. Street parking available. Acceptably clean, gender-neutral bathroom, and wheelchair accessible round out the vibe of Berkeley meets Haight and Ashbury meets the Mission District. I would recommend Philz Coffee without hesitation."
Philz Coffee,"Original Philz location: a real tesora aka ""jewel"" just like the coffee selection. Usually I go for the dark roast Jacob's Wonderbar, but went with the medium roast with caramelly vanilla vibes straight up today - feel like my receipt is a poem made just for me 🤓🥰"
Philz Coffee,"Heard this is where Philz started, their first location ever. They keep that vibe and it feels original, I’m wondering if it would become a huge tourist spot like that original Starbucks spot in Seattle. Philz tastes much much better though, hope they can get there someday! Love it!"
Philz Coffee,The philharmonic was absolutely what I needed light and refreshing with a light touch of cream. I also recommend the ginger cardamom coffee iced half sweet. You won't regret it!
Philz Coffee,"So good, they're always super helpful at offering alternatives if they don't have what I want (bc of supply issues). Love the real cream too"
Philz Coffee,Awesome coffee! You can’t go wrong with anything drink on the menu. It’s a bit on the pricey end but is totally worth it. There’s a monthly special drink that is discounted. The shop has a cool and hip vibe.
Philz Coffee,I bought a poorly made drink and tipped.  I did not receive a proper iced coffee after waiting forever in line so I left without my coffee and gave the bad white snooty workers cash they did not deserve  They owe me a coffee and my tip money back as well as an apology  His core management reminds me of an outdated mode of thinking; pretty chattel behind register
Philz Coffee,"Hi Luc,  Sorry that you did not leave with your ice coffee since the wait was so long. We are working on making our store better and appreciate the feedback. I would love to invite you back for another coffee.  Thanks"
Philz Coffee,"We live in Maryland and first tried Philz in Burlingame while visiting family. We were blown away at how delicious this coffee is, and were pleased to see a Philz open in Bethesda, Maryland. On a trip back to the bay area, we just had to visit the original Philz!"
Philz Coffee,Love the experience - feels like someone who cares made the coffee for me - which is the key differentiator of the place. Quite a selection of flavors and all that I’ve tried are good. Some better than others but there’s no bad option. I personally love the mint leaf touch in my coffee but it’s not the case for my aunt and uncle.
Philz Coffee,"My favorite coffee shop! A mint Mojito is exceptional. Parking is nonexistent, definitely a neighborhood coffee shop."
Philz Coffee,Super cute area. Excellent customer service.  Had a burrito and turkey sausage egg . Meh.
Philz Coffee,"This Philz is iconic. I love everything about it, including the countercultural stickers and graffiti."
Philz Coffee,Philz Coffee is awesome! I’ve never met a more welcoming friendly host. It was the first time my wife and I visited a Philz Coffee and so they gave us one welcome drink. Danny was so friendly and made us feel welcomed.
Philz Coffee,"My favorite cafe place in San Francisco. Strongly recommend Mint Mojito Ice Coffee, so fresh, unique and tasty!"
Philz Coffee,The cashier and baristas were so warm and welcoming! Simret was very friendly and got my order out so quickly! Will definitely come back for the great service again :)
Philz Coffee,"Rustic and artsy interior that pays homage to the Mission. The walls, the ceiling and the poles are a continuous mural. Giving it a -1 because the whole place kinda smelled like a restroom when we visited, which was unlike any Philz experience we’ve had so far. Still a great place to grab coffee at!"
Philz Coffee,Staff is very friendly and very professional wish there wasn't a huge language barrier and sometimes miscommunication with what type of drink but I don't think the customer is always right sometimes it's just a matter of taste preference I took my parents in and they didn't get what they expected but my drink was great
Philz Coffee,"A negative star would be more appropriate. I was greeted by a tall male wearing glasses. The cashier started complaining about the sounds of rap music that was playing outside from a passing vehicle. I ordered a small regular coffee with no milk or sugar. The shop was fully staffed. I observed the baristas standing around talking amongst themselves. After waiting for more than ten minutes for my coffee, I asked for a refund. Great, great service. NOT!!"
Philz Coffee,It looks just like atypical coffee shop in The Mission but the coffee is exceptional.  Place has typical bohemian decor and the staff is a bit short if they're busy so know what you want if it's peak time.  But anything you call a short coming is overshadowed by the quality of the product.
Philz Coffee,"I have been coming to this original Philz  Coffee nearly for three years, sometimes to run an errand for the whole family members. The ambiance and service has been a top notch, and the flavor of coffee made fresh has been out of the ball park!  This should be a landmark for SF."
Philz Coffee,"Apparently I went to a location unless it's all of them right now it doesn't take cash? That's all I had on me since I just wanted to quick coffee..... So I literally just went down the road to Starbucks, nice policy."
Philz Coffee,"Sorry you had this experience. Our stores do take cash, we are just dealing with a coin shortage currently and I apologize we were unable to help you at that time.  Hope you are able to return to Philz and try a Cup of Love next time you're in the neighborhood. "
Philz Coffee,"I got into the line of about 7 people at 9:30 Sunday morning and looking at the Take a Book Leave a Book rack I was pleased to see the big paperback Gödel Escher Bach 20th Anniversary edition. The barista took my coffee order for a large coffee with milk. At the register the cashier greeted me familiarly and I asked for a large Philz T-shirt but they only had medium and extra-large. The medium fit so I put it into my backpack, grabbed GEB from the shelf and settled into a large well-worn leather chair to enjoy my delicious coffee and look through the tome. Great coffee and service in a busy Mission coffee shop."
Philz Coffee,"I had excellent coffee and a pretty good cookie while working for a while.  I just wish their power outlet situation weren't a mess....  but maybe that's what happens when the space is full of comfy couches.  But you know what, clearly this formula attracts a wonderful crowd, and for that this is a 5."
Philz Coffee,"Great relaxed space, wonderful pastries but the coffee could be stronger"
Philz Coffee,"Cool spot with good eats and good coffee. Came to charge up my electronics while traveling. Breakfast burrito was tasty.  Just a heads up, some of the outlets are very worn out and can barely support a charging cable. I’d encourage the owner to replace these ASAP."
Philz Coffee,"Cashier didn't get the correct size n got it cold when I asked for coffee, which meant hot..."
Philz Coffee,I came here to pick up a postmates order. They have two sides where you order the coffee and order the food. After my order was done the nice beautiful african American lady( i think her name is lanet) made me what i had ordered for the customer on the house.which was a philtered soul which was delicious and that unknowingly to her that i needed because i just got off work working a graveyard shift from 12 to 945 so this was very much appreciated. I absolutely give this place a A plus. The vibes were also good so i can see why people go and it was so full
Philz Coffee,"I love Philz coffee ...the staff is super friendly , i went to restore my mural located at the entrance .it was very nice weather ...i love my neighborhood , the mission ❤🙌🙏 …"
Philz Coffee,"Good! Great! This coffee shop was fantastic! This is without a doubt the greatest spot to obtain a fantastic taste of coffee and sweets. Also, the employees here were fantastic, and I'd want to thank them for expediting my orders. It's a remarkable experience, and I'm sure I'll return to this coffee shop soon. Thank you very much!"
Philz Coffee,"Rachel opened today by herself and was such a champ! She gave every customer excellent service and no matter how long the line was, she stayed calm, friendly and got those coffees out fast. Her dedication really deserves recognition and I hope she understands how much her Pham appreciates her. Thank you Rachel!"
Philz Coffee,"Absolutely iconic place and history!  Got the mint mojito and the chocolate coffee, both were absolutely delicious and not at all generic tasting. Will definitely be back for the unique flavors and the great service. The maker of our drinks even insisted we try our drinks to see if we needed anything altered in them before we left.  This place has my heart for it's great products, service, and vibe all together!"
Philz Coffee,"A good local establishment with tasty coffee. I ordered and Ether blend coffee straight up (no cream or sugar), and think I should've ordered one of their flavored drinks or Jacob's Wonderbar. My coffee was good, but I think I set my expectations too high for a dark roast.  My friends were very happy with their Mint Mojito and Mocha Tesura, which was delicious when I tasted it."
Philz Coffee,I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT MOJITO COFFEE ITS THE BEST COFFEE DRINK EVER YOU GOT TO TRY IT FOR REALS MY BESTY LOVES IT BRITNEY WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL BARISTA VERY SWEET AND NICE
Philz Coffee,"Many years ago I lived off of 24th st and Capp. I used to go to Philz when he had a little corner store/plant shop/coffee bar. I think he charged me like $1.50 a cup for the most incredible coffee blends, made fresh right there.  I'm so glad he has a successful chain now, it's one of my first stops when I come to visit!"
Philz Coffee,No espresso. They only have drip coffee.
Philz Coffee,The coffee is tremendous.  And the price is good.
Philz Coffee,"Great cup of coffee. Be ready if your in a hurry. The way it's brewed takes a few extra minutes. That being said if you have time, nice place to sit and enjoy."
Philz Coffee,"It's my first time here and got very disappointed. No whole Milk, all coffee has some kind of flavor, restroom it's not open. Asked to warm pastry, they gave it to me but the coffee came out 20 minutes later, so the pastry was cold. Would I came back?...🤷‍♀️ …"
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, friendly staff, and the twice-baked almond croissant I had wasn't half bad either."
Philz Coffee,"I came here to work so I like the wifi here. It was fast and strong. The air was nice too. I like it Oh, the service was good. I love people hể😘🤗🤗 …"
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, cozy place and they'll help you set up your next meeting right away."
Philz Coffee,"Great cup of coffee , great service, nice atmosphere."
Philz Coffee,"Awesome coffee. This was my second time at a Philz coffee. My friend praised this place a lot. I was very happy with it. There are a lot of choices and variety for coffee. You can really fine tune what you want from here. First time I tried the Mint Mojito Ice Coffee, this time I had just a regular coffee which had caramel flavors. I would definitely recommend coming here for the coffee and doing some work"
Philz Coffee,Good coffee Good wlan Good cakes.  And the very best team of all. We lost a wallet the day before and it slided in a sofas back. We called. No wallet found. We came by. No wallet at the sofa. We asked. They found it and gave it back with a coffee on top!  Thats much more than you can expect. Cheers and many thanks again.
Philz Coffee,The most satisfying and unique coffee experience I've had. Their flavors are interesting and different from the usual milk-based drinks at other chain shops. Would come back here every day of my life if I lived in SF.
Philz Coffee,"The original Philz, and it's a great place to spend an afternoon. It's definitely a place a lot of people like to work, and with plenty of plugs and comfortable chairs, I recommend it too as long as you don't mind the usual coffee shop clamor. Really great coffee, especially if you like something a little different. Their flavor combinations are some of the most unique and tasty, but the best thing is they never are too sweet as is often the case with flavored coffee drinks. I recommend the Ginger Snap and the Mint Mojito"
Philz Coffee,I love the coffee at this place. And this one is the original 💞 …
Philz Coffee,"Love Philz coffee, just love it.  This location is very ""earthy"" or ""eclectic"" with lots of odd chairs and couches. The croissants are great. Also had the avocado toast which was excellent (assuming you like avocado). My favorite dark roast is Julie's Ultimate. The coffee isn't cheap remember."
Philz Coffee,"Found it hard to get a good coffee in the bay, but Philz came through with the goods. The fresh mint was such a delicious touch. Tried to relive the experience at another Philz and coffee wasn’t nearly as good. Thanks for the great service. Extra points for the Ice Cube pic on the ice machine! :D"
Philz Coffee,"Amazing coffee, great atmosphere, and friendly baristas.  What's more important?  Coffee is life."
Philz Coffee,The coffee was so over roasted I immediately had to throw it out. It was awful. The service was nice though.
Philz Coffee,"Getting lots of our favorite beans and enjoyed a Tantalizing Turkish with my beans.  While I like Blue Bottle and 4 Barrel for a treat,  Philz remains my standby for good coffee at moderate prices"
Philz Coffee,"I came here via Philadelphia where the coffee scene is pretty sophisticated with hand pours and lattes all over the city. Philz was a much needed departure from that with no frills, but as many options as one could ever want for coffee beans. After reading the description for the ambrosia I knew I had to try it. I ordered it Philz way with light brown sugar and shaken cream. ***It was the best cup of coffee I've had in my life.*** it had a smooth creamy buttery flavor, but the highlight was the oily flavor of the beans. The dude who poured my cup was super chill and showed me how the beans were so fresh and dank that the oils stuck to my fingers. He gave me a fist bump and I was on my way. Thank you, good sir. If anyone working there reads this the guy was awesome. Short beard, tan, chill dude, and really seems to know what he's doing! Thanks for the great coffee!"
Philz Coffee,"This coffee really is as good as they say! It's different from the fruity Skandinavien coffees but has a very pleasant and mild taste. The atmosphere in this original Philz Coffee place is authentic, very cozy and doesn't feel like a coffee franchise at all."
Philz Coffee,"I don't usually drink coffee and I loved the taste, couches are too comfortable."
Philz Coffee,Best coffee in San Francisco! I love the Mint Mojito. I just wish they offered larger sizes... I finished my coffee before I even got back to my car 🙂  The the atmosphere and the service is divine. The people behind the counter are always so friendly.
Philz Coffee,"Used to be one of my fav cafes pre-pandemic. There were the regulars, who came here to work and socialize. Phil Jaber the owner used to be there fairly regularly too. Their ice coffee was one of my favorite drinks, but the other coffees were really good too. It is rich and creamy (heavy whipping cream is the secret 😉)  Philz trivia: this is the original location and it used to be a corner liquor store that Phil owned and managed before he had the brilliant idea of pivoting and creating a super successful one-cup-at-a-time coffee."
Philz Coffee,Be prepared to wait over 30 minutes for a basic tea
Philz Coffee,"As with all Philz, you have to wait for your coffee.  One cup at a time. Definitely makes you think ""What am I doing here? Why am I waiting so long?"" ...especially since its not really the baristas that make the experience great because they're really not all that friendly nor efficient. I think it's the concept of a cup of unique coffee being brewed just for you is why you pay $3-4-5 for."
Philz Coffee,"Mint mohito tasted watered down, did not taste good"
Philz Coffee,"This was a cute little shop in San Francisco. Coffee was nice and robust. Beans were freshly sold if a customer wanted a bag. One thing that I could've added was the coffee cup sleeves. It was my first time being there so not sure if they do add sleeves and maybe they ran out that day. Not sure, but overall a good experience."
Philz Coffee,"I love this Philz! I’ve been going for 7 years and everyone who works there has always been so nice and friendly! Also, the coffee is great, love that Ecstatic Iced Coffee and the app makes it easy to avoid the line on weekends."
Philz Coffee,"For those that love coffee, or for even those who just like coffee, Philz Coffee serves up some of the best cups in the Bay Area.  I've tried many different blends that Philz Coffee offers and I have yet to be disappointed.  You pretty much can't go wrong.  There's a blend that works for just about everyone.  This location is always busy every time I've been through, but it hasn't ever seemed ""slow"" and I've always found a seat when I wanted to enjoy my coffee in the store."
Philz Coffee,"I really love Philz Coffee. I recommend highly. Philz has a variety of coffees and teas. They have a selection of light roast coffees as well. I enjoy the New Manhattan and my new favorite is Dancing Water. That one has hints of milk chocolate, grains, and cashew. Philz also has a variety of pastries as well. I usually get their cinnamon rolls and my mom will get their twice baked almond croissant. So, stop on by and bring your out of town guests. The small coffees are $3.75 and the large are $4.50."
Philz Coffee,"This is a gourmet and luxury coffee shop. The prices might make you raise your eyebrows, but if you're looking for a fancy flavored coffee like mint mocha, this is the place. Expect a long wait for your order, they are always busy."
Philz Coffee,Loved it loved it loved it my battery on my phone was dead and I use Google pay to pay so the lady there let me charge my phone she actually took it for me and charged it for me and also told me at first that I can pay after and then when she gave me my coffee and my bacon burritos she told me it's on the house today they also let me use the restroom which took a little long because I'm handicapped and they were nice they understood in the bathroom is very clean and hygienic and it's also cool because it's the flagship store it's smaller than the rest of them but you get an idea of where philZ coffee  started so amazing! I get a proud feeling knowing every time A PhilZ coffee opens up outside of the city and the state that it is originally from San Francisco California and not Seattle not anywhere else but strictly San Francisco California Republic!
Philz Coffee,"Love Phil and his wonderful coffee. His coffee has become a San Francisco Legend . From my first coffee in the 90's I knew he was going places. I go out of my way to find a Philz location and then I pick up my new fave beans ""Philharmonic""."
Philz Coffee,"The only problem is they just don't have regular percolated coffee for a couple of bucks. Everything is $5 and up. They should offer cheaper coffee as well to the locals that supported the store that it was prior to it becoming just Pete's coffee. I grew up in that neighborhood and $5 coffee is expensive. Their method was taught to me by my great grandma. It's nothing new. So appreciate the old time locals that may patronize your establishment if you offer $2 cups of ""house coffee"" and in this way may buy a Danish to go with. Let give back a little too our communities... I'm not talking free, I understand it's a business, just appreciation for the business they already gave you, that's all. Then I can give this coffee shop, which is not the only one on the block or on my way, 5 stars for giving back to their community which supports them with their dollars.😀"
Philz Coffee,"The coffee is good (I've been going for years because of it) but there are lots of coffee shops out there so for me the people made it special... so, I was disappointed to find they lost a great manager I was familiar with... I still come by but sure enough, it's just not the same... within a week they already changed their menu by removing the monthly blend.  It may take a couple months for them to recover, but for now, sad to say, I'll be giving other options a try.  Sorry Mr. Phil!  Next time I see you we'll catch up!!!"
Philz Coffee,"Long-time customer, I could've been an investor with all the coffees I've purchased here over the last 12 years. This is a must do when in San Francisco, their coffee is extremely tasty! Great vibe and lots of comfy seating, this is the original Philz and you'll often see the man himself here, wearing his trademark fedora."
Philz Coffee,"This one is the first location opened in SF. The vibe is pretty upbeat and chill at the same time. Being in mission it does get busy during peak hours. Their coffee is good and so is their tea. However, their chai is the worst I've ever had. (Don't ruin it with my review on one bed item) I do hate the fact that lot of their items have mint in it. May be some people like it and some don't so can't complain as it's personal choice for me. I've run into Mr. Phil once there a long time ago. The staff is also nice with smiling service."
Philz Coffee,"Ah-may-zing coffee! After a stop at what was supposed to be a place for great donuts and coffee (yuck), we were extremely disappointed and in search of some real coffee. We stumbled upon Philz and what a great find. The line was long but well worth the wait. Service was great, they take time to make the perfect cup for each customer. Price was average for coffee these days but the coffee was far from average. If it wasn't so far from our hotel we most certainly would be stopping there every morning and afternoon for a cup. Hands down one of the best cups of coffee I've had, and I consider myself hard to please."
Philz Coffee,"All around great coffee, great flavors. Try mixing Philtered Soul and Silken Splendor (Silken Splendor) great medium roast!  Fun place to catch up with a friend or a cafe feel to get your work done! Each Philz knows how to connect to the neighborhood and coimplete the community 😎🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
Philz Coffee,"I'd describe it as the hipster coffee joint without the hipsters, which is the best of both worlds in my opinion. Cool/chill baristas who are interested in having a quick chat about what you want and how you want your coffee made. It's all single cup drip coffee. We got the Tantalizing Turkish with a little soy and sugar and the Mocha. Both were awesome; coffee first and flavor second (the way it should be). Can't wait to come back here when I'm wandering around the mission next time."
Philz Coffee,Love this place. The people who work there are always so friendly and really focused on getting the coffee right. I'm not always a fan of brewed coffee vs espresso but they do such a good job.  Also the avocado toast with egg is very tasty  Still love this place! Doing the keto diet thing and love they can support it too!  Heavy cream and stevia yea!!! Thank you
Philz Coffee,"Love, love, love their coffees. Hot or cold, light, medium, or dark roast, I am a huge fan. Going here before work, it's not the worst rush. Going here on the weekend, terrible! Huge line that usually goes to or out the door, and since there's only a few people making coffee you'll easily be here for a half hour before your at the register. Coffee is decently priced, sometimes lower or higher than a Starbucks. Always cheerful laughter coming from the staff, and sometimes a song! lol"
Philz Coffee,Very cool and laid back place with the best coffee in town. They make all kind of roasts from dark to light going through medium and even all kinds of decaf. Don't miss out on the specialty coffees! And there's even tea for those who aren't really into coffee.
Philz Coffee,"pioneers of the one-cup-at-a-time coffee experience, i love this place.  sure the lines tend to be long and it's hard to justify $4-5 coffee on a regular basis, but it's a real treat.  i'm no fan of over-sweet coffee, but the mint mojito iced coffee is out of this world"
Philz Coffee,"The original Philz! Sometimes you'll see the man himself here, which is super cool.  I like this location because it has a warmth and a comfy neighborhood vibe some of the other Philz locations are lacking. The coffee is awesome here as is to be expected and they have the usual breakfast fare here: pastries, breakfast burritos, yogurts, etc."
Philz Coffee,Wonderful!  Added image of spotless customer area.  (Mar 28 2021)
Philz Coffee,"My favorite coffee in the city. Laid back, nice and knowledgeable servers. The menu is intimidating at first but the staff are friendly and helpful and not as pretentious as some other coffee spots in the city. Try Jacob's Wonderbar Brew! I recommend it with cream and a little sweet."
Philz Coffee,"This is the original location, great coffee and ambiance. Fair warning, this place gets crowded quickly so if you find a spot to sit down, grab it. Plenty of outlets around so you can get some work done. Order the Mint Mojito Mocha iced or hot and enjoy the day! Good spot to people watch as well as food bites available for purchase."
Philz Coffee,"I came here one day after lunch with some friends one day. At the time I walked in, I had not a clue of which drink I wanted, and only knew I needed a cup of Philz. The barista was very nice in helping me pick a drink (did I want something with a lot of caffeine? Do I like strong coffees or lighter coffees? etc.). Overall, excellent coffee, and excellent service! Will definitely be coming here again"
Philz Coffee,"The coffee is awesome. I went on a Friday morning and the service and experience was pretty bad. It's unclear the way the store functions in an operational way and the staff makes you feel like an idiot for not knowing. Advice: look up! There are signs -- helpful.  The staff felt very annoyed by everyone and even sarcastically commented ""we're not happy until you're happy"" when asking about milk.  Maybe it was just an early morning and people were having a bad day - I get that and would still try it out again, but had a much better experience at some of the other shops in town.  Again, The coffee is still fantastic, and if you're taking it to go... that's probably a happier experience :)"
Philz Coffee,"The coffee and service here is ridiculously amazing!  The coffee is strong, my mom loves their Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, she can't get enough.  I always get their mint tea made with fresh mint, honey, and milk...it's energizing and delicious."
Philz Coffee,Love the energy of the OG location!
Philz Coffee,"It is okay, for another chain operation. I am sorry there are just way too many ""coffee"" shops in this city, it isn't very funny. When one closes somewhere which ever it was (three more appear out of thin air somewhere else, only to endure the same fate if they can't build a minimum customer base to pay the high rents here. I prefer tea as a hot, but a Coke-A-Cola drinker for cold. Coffee never hooked me."
Philz Coffee,"My favourite coffee.  What else can I say?  Local business that makes a fabulous coffee better then Pete's, Starbucks (that's easy) or?  Try it.  They do a kinda weird thing where they put the cream and sugar for you but I was surprised how easy it was too get used to that.  Prolly because they have you taste it and fix it till you're happy."
Philz Coffee,"The drinks aside from coffee are not good, so avoid those.  The selection of allergen friendly food (plant based and gluten free) could use some work.  The vibe is nice and the quality of coffee, high."
Philz Coffee,"Nice vibes, great selections of teas. My wife's favorite joint. However, their coffee all have the same tastes and different names so they're all bunk. Good thing, I simply just get either a drink, a snack, or a tea from this place since it's near a kiddie park whereas my son can play about."
Philz Coffee,"The first Philz location that I ever visited.  This is still my favorite one !  They have a tremendous selection of incredible coffee. Served by the ""pour over"" cup, fresh for you at the moment."
Philz Coffee,"Philz is my favorite coffee shop. I almost always get a sweet and creamy mint mojito iced tea. If you haven't tried it yet, it is heavenly.  This location is easily accessible from BART and has seating for sitting and enjoying your coffee or a pastry."
Philz Coffee,"This is the original Philz Coffee, eclectic, funky, fun original SF vibe before all the techies, and hipsters came along and are ruining awesome places like this by wanting to change their surroundings; if that be the case you are free to move anywhere else you might fit in better.. Ooh yeah back to the Coffee it's the bees knees it's the best! Employees will make your drink correct here. Silken splendor is my personal favorite, secondly Jacobs wonderbar is great also my wife loves the greater haze."
Philz Coffee,"Best coffee in San Francisco, period. Ordering is like selecting from a wine list. I prefer the Silken Splendor. Also tell your barista how sweet you want it and how much cream soy etc.The 24th street location is pretty bohemian, but the worn seats are comfortable. They also have a good selection of pastries, toast and other munchies."
Philz Coffee,"Starbucks has absolutely nothing on this place. Their coffee comes in so many different varieties and strengths, and is made to your specifications. The barista's are always friendly and are willing to recommend something to your liking. Go here you will not be disappointed."
Philz Coffee,"Let me start by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of coffee.  That being said, this place is super good.  I'm not sure what it is about Philz coffee compared to other places, but this place is converting me to a coffee drinker.  Make sure to try the mint mojito on a warm day (the few that we have in SF)."
Philz Coffee,"This place is like a little oasis in the city. I love the light, airy atmosphere, and the potted plants give it a sort of outdoor patio slash rain forest vibe. The coffee and tea blends are good if a blend is what you're going for. I like the Tesora. Also, The staff have always been very nice and helpful when you're new and trying to decide which blend to choose."
Philz Coffee,"Decent coffee on a pricey side (eg. large mint mojito $6.5 with tax and tip). I never sit in there but seem to be popular for people with laptops, and  the ones who like to stare into smart phones. I like they keept old feel of the place, even thou Philz become corporate empire."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee here is great and the food is also pretty good. The coffee menu is extensive and there ordering system is a bit confusing.   Just know that you order coffee separately from ordering food. Coffee on the left side and food/pay on the right side. The coffee shop was busy when I arrived around 10 A.M. so I didn't sit and drink my coffee there. They do, however, have places to sit if you have time."
Philz Coffee,Trendy outlet with a chill ambience. Lots of couches but fill up pretty quickly.
Philz Coffee,I’m quite upset. I was there doing a postmates order and I had only asked one time if the order was already being made just so I could let the customer know and one of the employees behind the counter making orders couldn’t help herself in giving attitude saying I could get a refund if I wanted because they’re busy. I didn’t ask with attitude or with any disrespect I was just trying to get an eta for the customer in a nice manner I have no need to argue and I advised her it was just for postmates and she said still with attitude that she knows I’m working and she’s working too and I could get a refund if I wanted. She instead of responding nicely had to go and be rude and I don’t appreciate it when I myself am just trying to do my job. All I was trying to get was an eta and I got rudeness from her specifically everyone else was really nice and helpful.
Philz Coffee,"The original Philz! Friendly, old school Mission character. Good place to people watch and work, so long as you can get a seat (there are plenty but this place can get crowded!). And of course, great coffee made to order only."
Philz Coffee,"Good coffee. This isn't your typical chain. It's still got its edge. Servings are American sized, so a small does me just fine. Lots of variety on the drip coffee menu. Enjoy."
Philz Coffee,"I did not know coffee could taste so good before this place. My favourite so far is Philtered soul, hehe. They have lots of options, I really recommend it to pretty much anyone, rarely do you just run into coffee this good. Decoration is nice too"
Philz Coffee,"So so sad. I use to come here all the time for the estatic ice coffee back in the early 2000's. What happened to Philz? This ice coffee taste like a old dirty pond bucket! Not to mention the terrible service! On a slow afternoon at a coffee shop, 2 minutes is too long to be served. I don't know if I'll ever go back to the original Philz location again after this experience. It's not the first of it's nature."
Philz Coffee,Love coffee ☕.. staff is nice and caring too 💖 …
Philz Coffee,"The original, in the Mission. Big old comfy chairs,a lived-in, almost rustic vibe, and of course, their coffee, which is the best. I'm partial to Philtered Soul, with sweet, chocolatey overtones, and their Iced Ecstatic is aptly named, but all their brews are original and tasty. No esspresso drinks here: it's ""one cup at a time"" pour overs only. So you'll need to go elsewhere for your latte fix."
Philz Coffee,"Been going to philz for a decade.  Perhaps a sign of the times, but I just realized I got a large mocha and after tip paid $7+ .  Dont want to not tip the hard working staff but the massive expansion of philz is getting expensive.  Never do I spend that much at Starbucks tip included or at most of the trendy shops around.  Still love the coffee/tea and might get used to it but will dial back to see if its really worth a 30% premium."
Philz Coffee,"Favorite drip coffee to date! This Philz spot can be a bit crowded to sit at since it's the ""first"" so i think attracts some extra people. Love the spot in the Mission though, and you can't go wrong with the coffee"
Philz Coffee,Cool spot for coffee with a good vibe and free WiFi. So many options of different blends to pick from but the Iced Mint Mojito was spectacular. One of the best coffees I've had in my life.
Philz Coffee,The poeple are super friendly here! i love the people that are working here they talk to you like your family and they are nice to make all coffee one by one! i like coming here and if you have your own mugs.. they would fill that up without charging you more@@! everything would be charged as a small cup of coffee!@
Philz Coffee,"Each Philz has a different vibe, and since this one is in my old neighborhood and has an authentic lower 24th st. feel, I love it. It still feels local, family-owned and community supported, but benefits from the professionalism the company has adopted, which has fueled its growth and made it possible to get my favorite cup of coffee in several parts of the city and the Bay, a Jacobs Wunderbar with cream. Awesome!"
Philz Coffee,Trendy coffee shop that makes drip coffee to order.  They'll sweeten and add the milk and give it a stir.   You walk up to any line and wait your turn.   There's a description  of the type of grounds they have for the day.    Once you get your coffee you can sit around on one of their couches and enjoy your coffee.   This place is super busy weekend mornings.
Philz Coffee,"I love love love Philz Coffee  I go here about once a week to get my large Tesora fix.  The staff are super friendly, and the coffee is consistently good (I've managed to convince one or two non-coffee drinkers to try).  This store has some indoor seating many seem to use to work/play on laptops and a few outdoor benches for any who wants to sit outside.  Free Wi-Fi!  I've knocked it down one star because this particular location is always unbearably hot and also the coffee isnt that cheap.  Still definitely one of my fav places in SF."
Philz Coffee,"You won't find the regular latte, cappuccino, or espresso drinks here but will find a great variety of assorted beans, each with its own distinct characteristic. The staff are always friendly. Thank you for starting my day off right!"
Philz Coffee,"I really wish Philz Coffee was a national franchise. I would give these people my money every single day to drink their Silken Splendor with cream and light sweetener. Probably the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Don't expect capps or frapps or any of that at Philz. It's just straight up pour over coffee, done right. You'll have to wait a bit so don't come if you're in a rush. But the small wait is worthwhile. Miss you, Philz."
Philz Coffee,Every cuppa coffee is made to order on the spot. Each blend is unique and can offer exotic spices and flavors. Their iced coffee is great on a hot day too.
Philz Coffee,I love Philz coffee! I always get an iced mint mojito and it's been perfect nearly every time. The baristas are very friendly and attentive to what you want in your drink. The vibe is very eclectic and fun. Free Wifi is always a plus!
Philz Coffee,"Fantastic coffee with a wide range of eclectic drinks to choose from.  Also, I was there one time with my wife and we split an iced coffee.  The barista put it into two cups and gave us smalls for the price of one large because ""we're here to make you happy and not make every last dollar we can.""  That was awesome."
Philz Coffee,"This location is the original establishment for Philz and my favorite. Much like the interior the Baristas all have great character and are there to Delight you with the Mixology of Philz many flavors. Jacobs, dancing water, and Sumatra are my favorite"
Philz Coffee,"A comfortable, cozy coffee serving delicious drinks. Being the first Philz Coffee it is an iconic place. If you are a fan of Philz Coffee then it would be worth going out of your way to pay a visit."
Philz Coffee,Truly love in a cup. I recommend the mint mojito and the philharmonic.
Philz Coffee,The original. Always great service and prompt coffee that's hot and ready to start your day. Not too far from 24th St Bart and has good amount of seating with plugs for laptops.
Philz Coffee,"Great variety of coffees. You can order between two sizes, with or without added milk and sugar. Every one I've ordered has been delicious! A little on the pricier side, but worth it."
Philz Coffee,"Set  just outside of the heart of Castro, this Philz is one of the great locations serving locals and visitors alike. A wee bit cramped, but most Philz are like that. Grab a cup and go for a walk. Excellent service as always, and single brewed coffee the Philz way."
Philz Coffee,"I will never step foot in this place again. Two different male staff members were not only insolent and curt but they were just plain stuck-up and rude. The one at the cashier just stood there and stared at me when I walked up to pay for my coffee, even after I said, ""Hi!""- just stared at me, as if he would have rather not have had anything to do with me. He was sweet as pie to the woman before me, so maybe he was purely homophobic (which surprises me, but not really). Horrible, ugly service."
Philz Coffee,"Very popular place! Great coffee, but the lines to pay for coffee or food can go slowly. There is lots of seating (if you don't mind sharing couches), but the seats fill up fast."
Philz Coffee,"Coffee was pretty good, but it's a diuretic and they closed the bathrooms. My guess is because of the massive homeless population."
Philz Coffee,Excellent coffee. The baristas kick ass and dont break a sweat doing it.  Additionally the mural and artwork on the inside is like nothing I've ever seen.  Try the mint mojito.  Outdoor seating so you can peoplewatch and take in the wondrous sights and smells of The Mission.
Philz Coffee,"Philz Coffee is a great place if you're feeling a little coffee-frisky. The staff knows what they're doing, and even if you're a timid coffee orderer, they take the time to explain the choices. If you want a guaranteed good drink and don't feel like being overly creative, go with one of the specialty drinks."
Philz Coffee,"Best tasting affordable local non-pretentious coffee I have yet to find in San Francisco! Plus, I met Phil once at the Berkeley Coffee & Tea Festival. He's a nice dude who wears nice hats. What's not to like?"
Philz Coffee,"I don't see the big fuss. The coffee wasn't that great, I threw it away. Maybe it's the type of coffee I ordered, but it's one of their most popular options so I assumed it would be good. There's always a line there, but if all their coffee tastes like that then I would stop giving them your money."
Philz Coffee,"This location of Philz has the hipster vibe going on. There is always a line, but it's worth waiting for. I've tried every coffee on the list and m favorite is silken splendor. They also have a selection of pastries and breakfast foods like burritos and sandwiches to choose from."
Philz Coffee,"I love me some Philz. Especially their Philtered soul and Iced coffee.  This location is pretty cool. The baristas are all very friendly and cheerful, and sometimes you can even see Phil hanging around on his stool by the door. I even shook his hand once!"
Philz Coffee,"I used to go out of my way from Potrero and 18 for my coffee break here at Philz in the Mission. This is the original location and twice I've met Phil, the owner, behind the counter. (He's quite friendly btw.) I come here for two things: the spiced bagel on sesame (zaatar seasoning, olive oil, and cucumbers sandwiched in between toasted bagel), and the Mocha Tesora, or Jacob's Wunderbar, light sweet with cream.  You will not get an espresso drink here, they only serve drip coffee made to your specs. The barista will ask you how you like it, so be truthful and walk away with the perfect cup.  There is usually a single line, and they will call you up when they're ready to take your drink order. Proceed to pay and order food at the cash register down the line.  I love the dark chocolate Guittard mixed with the Tesora drip coffee!  This location is hippie-ish/divey compared to the newer retail locations. They resisted upgrades but in 2013, a new counter and cash wrap were installed. However, the old couches and tables remain to stay true to this location's origins."
Philz Coffee,"Caesar made us the best coffee,  ever!!!! Iced cinnamon today crunch.  Too good for words! Thank you!!! Sabina and Lara"
Philz Coffee,"Mint mojito!!! So delicious, even my friends who don't drink coffee really love getting that. They have such a wide variety of coffee beans that you can choose from and they're all delicious. I'm sure you will find something that satisfies you :)"
Philz Coffee,"A good place for an usual tea experience. Their only black tea turns out be an Earl Grey, heavy on the Bergamot, bizarrely served with fresh mint. The resulting shock to the system is almost as great as that from the enthusiasm and excitement of the people who prepare it - especially if you vist at 6am in the morning. Their pastries are unreservedly excellent, however."
Philz Coffee,Is this the original Philz? I think so. It's certainly the coolest. It makes my mouth water just thinking about their coffee. The Philharmonic with mint is divine. The vibe in here is great - it feels very old San Francisco.
Philz Coffee,"Really good coffee but, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the ordering process can feel a bit intimidating if you're not familiar with it. Take your time and talk to the barrista about what kinds of flavors you like if the menu is overwhelming."
Philz Coffee,"Wait, what? i didn't yet review the original! Fail.  Anyway this place is great - its no corporate -standardized - cookie cutter coffee place. This place screams authenticity whether you like it or not.  And you like it. B/C even if you say you dont - you quietly appreciate the realness.  Now i could go into all the handcrafted magic and the uniqueness of all the roasts. But - aint no one got time for that.  I dont care if its cold or hot - get the mojito.  You're welcome."
Philz Coffee,"One of my favorite coffees in SF. And this is the original location of the first Phil's coffee. Hats off to Phil, I remember when this location was a liquor store/bulk health food, back in the pre-gentrification days of 24th Street. Phil's persistence in trying new products, like one at a time boutique coffee on the side in his liquor store, really paid off big time. That, and being in the right place at the right time, namely the trendy 24th Street corridor when it became super-hip. But this doesn't diminish his accomplishment at all, in fact, makes it all the more richer. Delicious coffee and a fun atmosphere at 24th and Folsom conspire for a 4 star review, missing one star cuz of Long lines and high prices."
Philz Coffee,"Philz! The original location. The decor is so so so much fun. The line however...is not. This place is always packed! If its your first time or visiting the city and you love ice coffee get the mint mojito, its so good I dont even know if they can honestly call it coffee its almost candy. Great stuff. Don't plan to come here to get any work done, its packed and impossible to get power. Get your cup and get out. The SOMA location is less crowded."
Philz Coffee,"Really good coffee. Its way too expensive.. but, as an occasional treat- I’ll visit now and then."
Philz Coffee,"I don’t know, man. The vibe is cool and it’s apparently a staple, but unless you just want to eight minutes for a latte, I suggest going elsewhere."
Philz Coffee,"I've always been treated well here Upon visiting SF I always make a Mecca to Philz and preferably this original location Seating is awkward, but once you get one keep it! They don't turnover quickly here Wifi is ok Outlets to plug in are pretty sketchy You gotta kinda hope your cord is long enough to make it to one of the power strips The bathroom is a shrine of radical graffiti and is a little downtrodden usually so not for the faint of heart I love Philz!"
Philz Coffee,"This is perhaps my favourite coffee place in the Bay Area (the other being Blue Bottle). This being the original location, it's a must visit for any Philz fans.  They have an excellent selection of coffee blends to try. I've sampled several of them with my personal favourites being Philtered Soul and Jacob's Wonderbar Brew. They have good sized descriptions of each blend to help you choose if you like, say, floral or nutty notes.  For first timers, try the Tesora (their main blend) or their famous specialty concoction, the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee (made sweet and creamy and totally delicious)."
Philz Coffee,"Oh Phil, you've made a coffee drinker out of me. I've been so used to my fancy lattes and oh-so-imperfect cups of the regular 'Bucks, but Philz is a tasty gulp of freshness. The ""baristas"" serve a mean cup-O-joe and know their beans. Grab a Philtered-Soul or the iced Mint Mojito and get ready for a coffee journey."
Philz Coffee,Philz is the ideal starbucks strives to emulate. The coffees tend to be carefully made and the customer's happiness is held paramount. If you're interested in something sweet try the mint drink.
Philz Coffee,"By far, my favorite coffee shop (or any Philz spot really). Unlike other places that have pour-over coffee, Philz's is strong and full-bodied. Try one of the varieties with mint for something new and refreshing."
Philz Coffee,The original Philz! What more can you say?
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, friendly service just like all the Philz I've visited. But docking a star because this place is ALWAYS crazy-insane crowded, so finding two free seats is often near-impossible :(."
Philz Coffee,"I know why this is a local favorite! When you walk into this shop you feel like you walked into somone's living room that is adjacent to a coffee bar. The staff is nice and knowlegdable. I said ""Iced Coffee"" and I was immediately directed to the Estatic Iced coffee, a blend of roasts. I drink my iced coffee black. The flavors in this coffee were subtle and it wasn't too acidic. I would definitely stop here before one of the chain coffee shops for a cool pick me up! I also had their banana chocolate chip walnut cookie. It was huge and oh so yummy!"
Philz Coffee,"Mikey was an exceptional barista who went above and beyond to make me feel at home here. I had lost my wallet and needed to keep my backpack safe while I ran back to retrace my steps, and he generously helped me feel that my items would be safe and that the world was not, in fact, coming to an end. I really appreciate the easygoing mindset of baristas at Philz, and I believe Mikey exemplified the community-oriented ethos of this wonderful space."
Philz Coffee,"An overcomplicated ordering system for mediocre filter coffee. Ok for American coffee which isn't saying much, still had that watered down and kinda stale taste about it. Unjustified pretentiousness. Typical stupid big cups. Would not last two seconds in Melbourne."
Philz Coffee,"One of the original Philz locations. Their friendly staff is complimented by their cozy living-room vibe. Lotsa outlets and good wifi, it makes for a good place to work if you don't get easily distracted by the heavy foot traffic of other patrons."
Philz Coffee,"Been visiting this Philz off and on for a few years and unfortunately I think this place is really lacking in customer service and accuracy. It really feels like the last thing they want to do is take someone's order and I've been given the wrong drink multiple times.  I know the work is tough and thankless, but now I have to shake it off too."
Philz Coffee,"I love this particular Phil's coffee! It is a cool vibe and the coffee is perfect! My favourite is the philtered soul, it is brewed to perfe tion here! Tried a couple of other Phil's coffee shops but this is my fave ! Thank you for being awesome"
Philz Coffee,"Love my large Ether, friendly staffs, fresh pastries. Wish Philz  stay opens later than 8:00 pm. During the day little hard to find a parking spot, have to drive around the block several times."
Philz Coffee,"DRINKS: 1.) Mint Coffe Mojito = Yum so good. This has got to be the best most unique coffee 2.) Drip Coffees = otherwise their drip coffees r all so strong n tasty :) with the option for them to sweeten it or not. I used to get crazy caffeine buzz off Philz 3.) Veggie Quiche - oooh, of the food this is the best 4.) Meat Quiche - not as good as the veggie. Must have quiches toasted for you tho. Do not eat cold. 5.) Chocolate Croissant - I know I got a croissant before n it's true, you really can judge a coffee place by their pastries. yum. I had them toast it up a lil an it was perfection.  SERVICE: Good  ATMOSPHERE I love this one. In the Castro Mission almost... I love the neighborhood here... and walkable distance from Dolores.. Small though."
Philz Coffee,"For an early bird like me, this is a fabulous place. I can get my coffee at 6 during the week, 630 the weekend, and get working before the line builds up. Super fan of the ether, with cream. Delish!"
Philz Coffee,"We were having a small conversation and the cashier jokingly told me ""your latte days will be over after getting this coffee"" because I had told him I usually get latte and then what do you know! He turned out to be right and all I'm craving is for their coffee!"
Philz Coffee,"Great, uniquely blended and roasted local coffee spot. There's not a huge crowd for a Tuesday afternoon, and I was able to charge my phone and earbuds without trouble."
Philz Coffee,"Amazing coffee variety (like all Philz), great vibe. several sofas and comfy chairs, but a little light on the tables. More of a place to relax with a newspaper or chat, than study with a laptop."
Philz Coffee,"what can i say the mojito iced coffee got me hooked. This place was the original, i love the rustic decor so Mission/valencia. very tight inside you can literally read the other person's email =) I would recommend for the history and to feel the mission/valencia vibe."
Philz Coffee,"It's okay. All blends,  no single origin light roast except on rare occasions. In my opinion,  Philz is right between Starbucks and Blue Bottle. Not close to Ritual, Verve, etc but wil do in a pinch. Bonus star for being from The City and open on Christmas!"
Philz Coffee,"Love and hate relationship with this place, on one hand their food is super good (croissants!!) but their way of brewing the coffee is just not right for me as I'm an espresso lover. I also miss the foamy lattes."
Philz Coffee,"Visiting in the Mission for 2 chilly weeks, Philz was my oasis with yummy coffee, avocado toast, and WiFi.  Especially sweet was a barrister named Ethan who made my day by remembering my name♡ I also LOVED, as an ecologist, that they encourage bringing your own travel mug with a lovely discount on drink...yay!☆☆☆☆☆!!!"
Philz Coffee,Original Philz—it’s awesome!
Philz Coffee,"I love Philz. Such a great selection of coffee. Everyone is so friendly and laid back. Great place to grab some coffee and do some work, or light reading."
Philz Coffee,Very neat coffee shop with lots of character. Many people hang out here. I tried their tea called Istanbul Treat. Their mojito coffee seem to be very popular.
Philz Coffee,"Iced Philtered Soul, sweet n creamy, the big oversized leather chair in a cozy corner and my fav book. I ❤Philz... great service, atmosphere is very comfy."
Philz Coffee,Always have a great experience here. The baristas are fantastic and have fun loving personalities. If you are lucky you'll even run into Phil himself!
Philz Coffee,I always have a great cup of coffee at PHILZ. Friendly staff. If you don't know what kind of coffee you want just ask the staff. Their recommendations will never fail you.
Philz Coffee,"Chilliest coffee shop. This is the original, so I would definitely check this place out. It's got big comfy couches and tables to work at. But mainly go because the coffee is amazing!!"
Philz Coffee,Long lines but worth the wait. Delicious warm and cold coffee. My favorite is the MINT Mojito Coffee. That is my favorite coffee EVER!!! GO THERE!!! You will not be disappointed.
Philz Coffee,"It's surprisingly very spacious inside, a good spot to do work with a laptop."
Philz Coffee,"Phil'z is a beloved SF local coffee shop expanding quickly across the city and peninsula, and even in talks of expanding nationwide. Usually locals will fall within one of several coffee cult followings: Blue Bottle, Philz, Four Barrel, Ritual, Sightglass or other specialty imports - depending on your preferences for cream, acidity, and specialty drinks.  Phil'z offers a large variety of one cup at a time brewed coffee, made with a generous handful of beans to achieve the rich, caffeinated consistency. I found the original location to stay truest and least diluted (24th and Folsom in the Mission). I couldn't replicate it at work with the automated machine or at home with my fancy French press or bialetti - you must pay a visit in person at least once to try it for yourself.  Another secret to their success is their use of thick manufacturers grade Berkeley Farms half and half cream which may add a pound or 2 to your waist over time but makes coffee taste like ice cream. I feel sad for you if you are lactose intolerant. They offer sugar and milk alternatives including Stevia, splenda, soy, and a variety of reduced fat milks.  Their most popular item is their Iced Mint Mojito ""the Philz way"" - in layman's terms iced coffee medium sweet and creamy muddled with fresh mint. Definitely a treat and unique item you can't find anywhere else.  If you like New Orleans or Turkish, head to Blue Bottle for their iced coffee, or something with more berry notes and acidity go to Ritual. There are plenty of options local and imported, but Phil'z is my top contender in SF for coffee."
Philz Coffee,Great coffees. Pour over for each customer as you order. Exotic blends. You'll like it
Philz Coffee,Great nostalgic vibe with beautiful people making beautiful coffee. Love the art on the inside and just the vintage feel and coziness of the store.
Philz Coffee,"I've been working a construction job around the corner from the first Philz in existence and so of course I've been ramping up my addiction every weekday afternoon to get me through until 7 pm or so often affecting my sleep at night and yet still keep coming back, that's how much I love it. Add to that getting to talk to friendly and interesting baristas such as Tomie who loves to sing which to me makes the experience very San Francisco."
Philz Coffee,"The word Philz takes my mind to a magical place filled with the fresh first brewed aroma of coffee in the morning seeping out of the welcoming facade, footsteps away from the true folks of the daily ""grind"" (pun intended) on 24th street, Frisco Cali.  My fiance and I first fancied this place during a meeting for wedding plans in the Mission, and on the hunt for good, cultured bean we happened upon what was a life changing albiet comforting morning ritual. Enter - gaze upon the hip millennial clientele brandishing literature, the latest iphones and tablets, and indulge yourself in the melting pot of a language cacophony, stirred up like the mixings of the whismical delights they offer.  ATTENTION NEWCOMERS: order first with one of the, at first intimidating and quickly warm, welcoming coffee slangers at the counter. Order a wondrous concoction, and proceed to the pay station to exchange your hard earned currency for hand-made artisanal cups of joe, made one at a time, just for you.  Exit leaving refreshed, greet the morning sun in stride, and take on the day.  To Phil, and Philz comradery, mayhaps I say you're the definition of good peoples!  EDIT: An afterthought. They ask you, post coffee wizardry, how your drink tastes before you saddle up and enter back into the concrete jungle. Wise words of a morning guide, and eternally grateful for this consideration. One word: WOW."
Philz Coffee,"Wish they had espresso drinks, but they've got drip coffee totally nailed. Got to meet Phil, he said: ""Coffee relaxes you, man."" I think he was wrong, but I liked him anyhow. Great coffee."
Philz Coffee,"I still cant get the hype about this place. Definitely super cosy atmosphere, but coffee is bad. I can see them brewing right in front of me, but tastes like hours old drip."
Philz Coffee,"This is where it all started. 24th and Folsom. If you're now enjoying your Jacobs Wonderbar, Sooo Goood, Mint Mojito, or Tranquilizing Turkish in Sunnyvale, Sausalito, or Santa Monica - 24th and Folsom, this is where it came from.  Customized blends to perfection, awesome baristas, and a funky store. Even if you only drink coffee every once in a while, this is a MUST in San Francisco.  Not to mention that my most memorable experience at this store was when Mr. Philz himself helped me opening the toilet door (from the outside). Thank you again for that."
Philz Coffee,"The OG, still one of my favorites."
Philz Coffee,The coffee was really good. Definitely would stop by again if I could. The people working there were super nice and helpful in their suggestions.
Philz Coffee,"people on laptops wanting to be seen with weird looks on their faces. a large shanty with lots of coffee variety. special coffee costs $120.00 / lb! i ordered ""Sooo Good"", pronounced it ""sou"" and got corrected- ""so"". i should have taken a picture."
Philz Coffee,Best cold brew that exists
Philz Coffee,"Coffee/tea is getting more expensive, but still great. This place has a very friendly atmosphere, making it one of my favorite places to work. Just don't expect it to be quiet."
Philz Coffee,philz coffee is known for their iced mint mojito.  these can be made to your sweetness perference. i believe there is available wifi as well. seating and area is very clean.
Philz Coffee,"I love their mint-mojito! Of course, sweet and creamy is the way to go. Every time I stop by Philz, the baristas prepare my coffee with care."
Philz Coffee,"Very good, but not what you traditionally think of for ""coffee"", since so much of the experience is about the cream and sugar they use.  Delicious, but not where you go for black coffee."
Philz Coffee,"Landmark original cafe, decent coffee and above average bake goods provided by Starter Bakery, courteous and efficient, decent house music, room to laptop or not, comfortable sofa seating, game boards and lending library...."
Philz Coffee,Delicious single cup coffees. I love the iced coffees too. Mint mojito and Rose heaven are wonderfully creamy and sweet.
Philz Coffee,They've probably got the best coffee I've ever had...which isn't surprising since they've got all kinds of different choices.  They also have really helpful and friendly baristas.
Philz Coffee,"My onion/cream cheese with tomato and cucumber BAGEL was delicioco!  However, I gave the place only 3 stars because it was really dirty and there were tons of flies ""grouping"" and hovering just over my table!  What tha?"
Philz Coffee,I was wondering about the neighborhood and found this shop. Love the coffees because they are unique in flavor and haven't tasted any where else. Definitely will go back.
Philz Coffee,Best coffee that my taste buds have ever tasted! This place is always busy however the baristas are quick and friendly. The coffee is worth the wait!
Philz Coffee,"A hangout for locals. If you have out of town guest who are serious about their coffee , this is a great option. Dog friendly, a little low on diversity for the mission but cool."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee isn't bad, I know a lot of people are fans of it since it's local. not really a coffee person myself but the hot chocolate isn't bad at all."
Philz Coffee,"If you're like me and don't know anything about coffee, don't panic when you see the huge list of options! Let the barista know what you're in the mood for and what you like/dislike, and then have your mind blown."
Philz Coffee,"The place is cozy. It is good to chat or get a little work done while enjoying great coffee! Good reasonable drinks, and chill vibe."
Philz Coffee,Awesome spot but occasionally outside beats are used by folks who smoke cigs. Ugh
Philz Coffee,Good coffee… just takes so long sometime 30-40 mins to get one frickin’ coffee ugh.
Philz Coffee,Great place to drink coffee and Chat it up a bit....But don't Be fooled by those nice comfy couches..I GOT BIT UP ALL ON MA LOWER BACK AND UPPER NECK BY ****BED BUGS**** Yep Not trying to ruin ya Good thang..But stay off them COUCHES!!!
Philz Coffee,Not good
Philz Coffee,"This is the original pour-over hipster coffee joint. Linger all day for the louche decor, hilarious local characters and general vibe of the neighbourhood. Coffee is pretty good too."
Philz Coffee,"Knowledgeable Batista's. Friendly service. Greeat coaches and tables. Great coffee. Strong too. Study, leisure, friends. Perfect place to wind down in sf weather."
Philz Coffee,Original location sad my regular barista is not there but they all seem to knw how to makebit amazing at this location
Philz Coffee,Always delicious Its fun to order coffee that is described like wine!!! Friendly staff
Philz Coffee,"Love this place, great coffee, the staff is friendly and fast and there's a pretty cool vibe. It's spacious an there's a lot of sitting space"
Philz Coffee,Staff is pleasant and attentive...coffee and teas made to order per your request...clean and quiet and prices as expected... I prefer the original space instead of the newer locations
Philz Coffee,"I really like Philz Coffee. I always get a ginger snap, extra creamy. However this is not my favorite location to get my Philz Coffee."
Philz Coffee,Absolutely the best cup of coffee
Philz Coffee,Philz has great coffee and I enjoyed drinking it there if i can because it reminds me of a massive livingroom. Love the atmosphere
Philz Coffee,"Disgusting bathroom at this location. The Philz coffee and the ""experience"" are what they are-- you're either into that kind of thing or you're not. I prefer Starbucks."
Philz Coffee,Best cup of coffee I think I’ll ever have was served here @ Phil’s Coffee. The original Phil’s that is.
Philz Coffee,"A lovely, down to earth coffee place. The drinks are delicious and the Batistas are more than willing to fix up the drinks if necessary."
Philz Coffee,"Iced Mint Mojito was so freshing after a long walk around The Mission area. I bought two random bags of coffee as souvenirs, wishing I bought more!"
Philz Coffee,"Nomz!  Same as all of the other Philz. Try the ecstatic iced coffee! Or the mint mojito iced coffee. For quality coffee in the Bay Area, you really can't go wrong."
Philz Coffee,"A bit crowded, but in typical Phil'z fashion, they have very tasty individually brewed cups of coffee and an impressive selection of coffee beans."
Philz Coffee,Favorite coffee in SF.  The iced coffee might be the best I've ever had.  Great place to hang out and get work done on a weekend.
Philz Coffee,"my favorite. Tell them what you like & they'll make recommendations. they also mix in the cream/sugar for you if you want it, and the result is beautifully blended."
Philz Coffee,"Hands down the best coffee in the world. Nothing comes close. Huge selection and knowledgeable staff. It's more than a cup of coffee, it's an experience."
Philz Coffee,Wow...super special experience.  The Turkish coffee was unique and certainly was a treat.  Blew me away.
Philz Coffee,Walking by and decided to stop by this unknown coffee house (to me)..... the mocha iced coffee was perrrrrfect! I could actually taste the coffee freshly ground and everything. Wish there was one closer to me!
Philz Coffee,I go here regularly ! I always get tea or their iced ginger snap! So good. It's never really packed so that's a plus!
Philz Coffee,Been wanting to come over to this coffee shop for so long! Did not disappoint at all!!
Philz Coffee,"The beverages were okay. The zucchini bread was old, dry and had very little flavor. Will not return."
Philz Coffee,"I walk by on my way to work, sometimes on my way back. When I work from home I work from Philz as much as actually from home. One of my favorite places in the city. And coffee is unlike any other."
Philz Coffee,"Excellent coffee, lots of options and room for personalization. Great service. There was a line when I went but it moved quickly."
Philz Coffee,This is the original spot. The coffee is solid. It’s a neighborhood spot where may of the locals go. It’s a bit old but has charm.
Philz Coffee,"While it's probably also the most expensive cup, it's also absolutely the tastiest cup of coffee around. The staff is great and the food is pretty decent as well."
Philz Coffee,The coffee here is amazing and the staff is great. Prices are reasonable. The bathroom is always full though which is weird...
Philz Coffee,Nice vibe
Philz Coffee,"Very trendy place...just come and chill. Internet available. Have their coffee please, its a most do in San Francisco. Accessible to Public transportation."
Philz Coffee,"Well is a good selection of coffes, but I have yet to find an espresso equal. Select drip choices, though."
Philz Coffee,Crafted one cup at a time. The Ecstatic Ice Coffee (I like mine with cream and sugar which they'll add) is amazing!
Philz Coffee,In my little SF experience the best coffee in the city. Nice folks and nice staff. Highly recommended!!
Philz Coffee,This was great. It wasn't a long line in spite of the Covid protections. The coffee was good and as always. The service was great!
Philz Coffee,"Made me sick. I ordered a hummus bagel with veggies and it was $7.73 which is a lot for that. also the hummus was was too liquid so it slid everywhere, and the bagel was dry. And now my stomach is messed up."
Philz Coffee,"Quite good coffee, ""one cup at a time"". Sufficiently strong that I usually drink very little or feel like I'm going to have a heart attack afterward, or both."
Philz Coffee,Given that this was the first Philly this place has a lot of history and character..It's pretty crowded but has great seating options and the coffee is pretty awesome
Philz Coffee,"The people here are awesome.  Everyone's happy and ready to go.  The coffee is spectacular, but I kept coming back for the smiles!"
Philz Coffee,Always good coffee here. Love it!
Philz Coffee,Great first time experience!! Lovely people and the coffee is WOW! So fresh🤤 …
Philz Coffee,"The only one to go to is 24th street as it is a funky cafe, on a funky street, in a funky town. All the other Philz just feel like corporate franchises."
Philz Coffee,Fantastic Philz! Wide selection of delectably quirky and classic coffees ☕️ to satisfy the most discerning coffee aficionado. Peace ✌️
Philz Coffee,"This place made me rekindle my romance with coffee all over again! Single drip heaven, friendly staff and an environment that doesn't feel rushed."
Philz Coffee,"Philz coffee is always amazing, made to order coffee, the staff is soo friendly and helpful and its the original location. Very ecclectic."
Philz Coffee,"Far superior experience to that of Haus Coffee across the road. Much more friendly, inviting staff, who know how to put hospitality first."
Philz Coffee,"The oldest Phil's coffee in SF, I've heard. Great location close to balmy street with the popular murals."
Philz Coffee,Very friendly and nice place. Try the cold coffee options. Also the muffins were really tasty.
Philz Coffee,The original Philz on 24th and Folsom is more fun for me than most of the newer locations. It's more homey and cozy.
Philz Coffee,"Philz has a lot of blends. Find the one you want, find the cream and sugar ratio you like, and you'll be set for life."
Philz Coffee,"Very nice place with a very nice and friendly staff :) great selection of coffees, I had the Mission special and it was delicious"
Philz Coffee,You can't get bad coffee here. It's not starbucks though. If you like starbucks froo-froo drinks you probably shouldn't go here.
Philz Coffee,It was my first time at Philz No doubt I had a really good coffee But the bad thing is the employee with the white hair was rude guy and disrespectful !!
Philz Coffee,"Nice atmosphere, but don´t think the coffee is that much better than the other places nearby which are way cheaper.."
Philz Coffee,"Great, reliable coffee. Not too expensive, always good. Sometimes amazing. Expect a major jolt no matter what."
Philz Coffee,"Hands down the best pour over coffee I've ever had. Fantastic, eclectic place."
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, but notifications claim coffee is ready when it'll be 10 more mins?"
Philz Coffee,Must try coffee joint. The Turkish coffee is my favorite. Lots of room to chill and near 24th and mission Bart.
Philz Coffee,takes way too long to make an mediocre coffee. other locations are better save yourself
Philz Coffee,"Local headquarters original Philz you gotta try ,it's like being on Philz living room!"
Philz Coffee,"Always great service and tried Gingersnap iced coffee this time and loved it, but a little granular at the end."
Philz Coffee,I don't get this place.  Like a lot of other places in San Francisco - it eludes me.  The coffee is mediocre.  And there are always lines of hipsters waiting to get the next dose of caffeine.  Please stop hyping places that don't deserve it.
Philz Coffee,"Good pour-over coffee, lots of couches to hang out on, and a late closing time. I personally love the ecstatic iced coffee."
Philz Coffee,The service is great with the fast service and good quality coffee. I did like the selection and was impressed with how quick they delivered my coffee.
Philz Coffee,"Great coffee, nice staff. Coffee takes 25mins often"
Philz Coffee,"If you are newb here, try out the the Tesora (medium cream medium sugar ;)) If you like something cold , mint mojito is the choice for you."
Philz Coffee,"One of the best coffee places I've ever been, staff was super friendly and the coffee was amazing."
Philz Coffee,Great! We are Dutch tourists and read about Philz in a Dutch magazin. It was recommanded and they were right. Philz is unique!
Philz Coffee,I can totally understand it’s popularity! Great spot!
Philz Coffee,"Amazing coffee, best price in SF too"
Philz Coffee,Good philz. Lots of other stuff around but tends to be crowded. Not a problem if you just want to grab a coffee and go.
Philz Coffee,Delicious iced mint mojito. Didn't know coffee and mint could be such a good combination!
Philz Coffee,Really helpful tips about the area from staff and the coffee blends are amazing. Try a cinammon twist too sooo good
Philz Coffee,"Coffee is good, but it can be a bit pricey here compared to other places.  Has free wi-fi so that's a plus."
Philz Coffee,Great coffee. Great customer service. Not enough electrical outlets in the store to work from their store.
Philz Coffee,"Lived up to its reputation. Stellar coffee, brewed individually with care. Exceptional value for price."

Philz Coffee,"It is famous for its unique mint mojito coffee. This original home is a bit outdated. It's a neighborhood that makes you feel a little uneasy when you're alone. The car has to be parked on the street, so you can find a suitable place around. The inside of the store is spacious, but it feels very old. Maybe it was because I went at night, so I was even more impressed. But it's worth a visit for the taste of the coffee and the unique menu. If you are a traveler, I recommend a daytime visit."
Philz Coffee,"The first store of San Francisco internet celebrity Philz Coffee. Every time I take guests to visit this neighborhood, I will introduce it emphatically. Especially during the cold trip to San Francisco, order a cup of Jacob's wonderbar, which will warm your hands and heart.  Because it is the first store and it is located in an area populated by Mexicans, it feels a bit dilapidated, but this does not reduce the pilgrimage mood of coffee lovers, and there is always a long queue. Now the queuing situation has improved, perhaps because more and more stores have opened, and various companies have also provided Philz coffee for free.  Philz has brought hand-dripped coffee back to the mainstream again. After drinking Starbucks' stereotyped Italian extraction, Philz has brought more flavors into the public eye, and every cup of coffee has been perfectly blended with sugar and milk.  It should be noted that after ordering, you need to go to the door to pay, and then go back to the barista who helped you order to get coffee."
Philz Coffee,"The coffee is delicious, it's not expensive, the staff is friendly and you don't have to wait long for your order"
Philz Coffee,"I don't know when I drink mojito coffee, but since I'm in Korea, I keep thinking about it!! The jalapeno bagel is my life bagel!!!! Thumbs up!"
Philz Coffee,It's the first taste I've ever tasted. I never thought that mint and coffee would go well together. eat it It taste good. Come on.
Philz Coffee,Iced Mint Mojito is really delicious as rumored!
Philz Coffee,"I never thought coffee that isn't made in a steam machine would be this good!  Be sure to read the menu well since the combinations are of many varieties and you must know what you like so as not to get a bad taste.  In particular, I tried a coffee made with cocoa and it was great, the flavor is unique, as is its preparation."
Philz Coffee,"The people who served were super cool, although they took a while to deliver the coffee. They have varieties for all tastes, even special flavors. Everything is customizable and they have like 4 different types of sweetener. normal prices. I would give it 4 stars if it weren't for the pitiful bathroom, really horrible: VERY dirty."
Philz Coffee,"Exceptional coffee, clearly superior to the classic Starbucks. Very welcoming, bright and modern place. Definitely recommended!"
Philz Coffee,Drink coffee relax with good coffee several choices of coffee and roast. The coffees are of the American type do not look for espresso.
Philz Coffee,"Very cool place with excellent coffees, only past ones, no espressos. Free internet and super cool environment."
Philz Coffee,"Excellent place. Many mosquitoes at times, but the attention, music and top quality coffee."
Philz Coffee,"Good place to people watch and work, as long as you can get a seat (there are many, of course, but this place can get crowded!)."
Philz Coffee,"The 1st store wasn't crowded and it was leisurely Mint coffee is strange, but it's okay."
Philz Coffee,Very crowded place .. it's worth the 10 minute queue for the famous cafes of this place!
