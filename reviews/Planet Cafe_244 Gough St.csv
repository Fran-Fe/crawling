Planet Cafe,"A very tiny cafe, but very friendly service. Food was tasty and coffee was good. Definitely would recommend"
Planet Cafe,"Very nice service. Range of lunch time items including a tasty vegetarian Ethiopian plate! Savory and sweet crepes. Traditional date too, like turkey and cheese sandwiches. Grilled cheese. Salami. Salads. Drinks, I saw beer in the cabinet as well. Hygenic for the pandemic age: They have a barrier inside in front of the cash register, and some tables outside to wait at. Tasty and attractive preparation."
Planet Cafe,"Great chai latte. Smooth and creamy, not too sweet. Friendly and prompt service. Takeout window style during COVID times, but they put their menu and snack displays in the window for easy ordering."
Planet Cafe,"This was a nice little gem of a store to discover. A wonderful selection of Indian products from ready made frozen samosas to pickled products and an abundance of snacks to try. At the rear of the store there is a produce section with some rare items that aren't available in most chain groceries. Curry leaves, eggplant pluots, bitter melon, okra and more."
Planet Cafe,"I loved this place! Very cute, and has nice selection of food and coffee. I tried their nutella banana crepe and coffee, both were delicious. Definitely i am gonna come back again!"
Planet Cafe,"Planet Cafe SF is a modest yet comfortable space, with great munchies, drinks, and actively managed by the loveliest people.  Don't skip the crepes (amazing), coffee, and eats as they are all made with quality, care & LOVE."
Planet Cafe,"Came to this small illy coffee shop on a late afternoon. It was empty with a couple of customers taking their items to go.  Free WiFi with 80's music played in the background. Not much of a selection on house coffee flavors, but good selection of sweet and savory crepes, salads, soups and sandwiches with typical pastries, croissants and muffins."
