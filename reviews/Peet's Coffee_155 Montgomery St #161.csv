Peet's Coffee,"Outstanding customer service and great coffee!  Arrived on Thursday about 7:30am, and there were ten people already seated inside the cafe. The queue moved swiftly thanks to the four baristas working behind the counter. I downloaded the Peet's app because it offers new customers 5 free drinks, which is a fantastic incentive."
Peet's Coffee,"Comfortable and ultra clean place to have coffee and work!  Friendly baristas and quiet environment to work while getting your caffeine fix. I got churro latte and customized the milk and sweetness levels to my preference, it was perfect!  They have outdoor seating too.  Definitely a great place for coffee!"
Peet's Coffee,I know Peet's coffee tastes was good and I like that's why I go to order small coffee and this store actually start from the customer service expression was not good I paid $2.92 for small the test was not really good it look like water a lot that is not the coffee taste I tell her for the employee the better one but not really coffee I was marked and I leave the coffee I was not happy because just I pay $2.92 free money. Because Without the good service.
Peet's Coffee,Espresso good as always at Peet’s Nice location
Peet's Coffee,"A brand new and beautiful Peets coffee with a comfortable and charming decor. I loved sitting in the couch-like sofa chairs and writing this review. The only reason why I give it a 4 star review, is because the decaf coffee was a bit burnt tasting. However, I was able to adjust the flavor by adding a generous serving of soy milk. I would definitely come here again to work or have a meeting!  #modern #coffee #morningcoffee #decafcoffee"
Peet's Coffee,Clean and quite place. Wonderful staff.  Awesome Cappuccino.
Peet's Coffee,"I’ve ordered coffee here a number of times. The staff are wonderfully polite but I don’t think very efficient. So many times I’ve ordered something simple, and it takes way too long for how many people are working at one time. Even pickups are a mess. The app tells you it’s ready. You go down there and it’s not ready so you wait. Then finally you ask them about it and it was ready, but sitting in the back counter for some reason. No where near the pick up counter."
Peet's Coffee,"I requested something with cold foam. Ordered what was recommended and it was disappointing, and without foam. I think it was an iced latte."
Peet's Coffee,"Great coffee and outstanding customer service!  Came here on Thursday morning around 7:30am, and the place already had 10 customers sitting inside the cafe. There were 4 baristas behind the counter that kept the line moving quickly. Downloaded the Peet's app for 5 free beverages for new customers, great incentive and service."
Peet's Coffee,"It doesn’t matter how many fancy coffee shops there are around town, when I want a well-prepared cortado at a reasonable price (not typical outrageous San Francisco prices), I always go to the nearest Peet’s. Price is a good differentiator and great disruptor in a city like San Francisco."
Peet's Coffee,The sandwich I ordered Was not in stock and I don't have anything else that I can eat here. Tried to get a refund They refunded me for the wrong item that was cheaper when I showed them what I paid for using my own credit card app they still shorted me a dollar. I'm very busy in the mornings I guess I won't come to Pete anymore. Stold my money and left me hungry.
Peet's Coffee,Many of the Peet's have closed a few are still open in this one by far has cool and awesome staff😎 I'm going to add to this still the most awesome cool wonderful Pete's awesome staff never too crowded but always a great place grab coffee and snacks 😸 …
Peet's Coffee,Cute place. Great atmosphere and good service.
Peet's Coffee,They should update their hours to clarify that they close at 5:40 p.m. and not 6:00 p.m.
Peet's Coffee,"I love this place until today. I always go here for my hot coffee with my family. But today incident stopped me go at this location in future. Terrible service cashier is nice lady but barista guy his him is kivin [Mathew] so rude with customer I saw him how he made coffee for customer. He pour cold almond milk in her coffee she complained instead of apologized barista through the coffee cup in his back sink and all over floor. He is so mean I feel so terrible for lady .I order for my wife hot cappuccino and Carmel coffee both coffee are Luke warm. I ask them do you have comments gard he ignored me and said he not familiar about what I am asking. Then I said never mind.shop close at 6pm and he rushing things still two hour to close store bangs the counter freeze doors.pointing the customer for pick up there drinks ,its bad hospitality he need to training more to handle customer service. Please management if you want your regular come back again please hire professional people 🙏. Check out your store cameras how he treats his customers. It's about around today at 3pm."
Peet's Coffee,Their pastries gave me lyfe! They have REAL ☕️. Starbux is just brown water blech! Still open. I remember when they opened. I also remember when that whole block was an empty brick warehouse I used to squat on the loading dock wkg in the Macromedia as a temp til I got hired perm across the street when SEGA occupied it too. Now Zynga maybe they're gone too. Who knows nowadays! I've been around too long... cheers to good coffee and cream cheese apple pastries mmmmm!
Peet's Coffee,"Got here at 6:30 am and thank God they were open cuz I needed my caffeine asap. The usual great coffee and pastries, service was great,and bathroom was clean."
Peet's Coffee,"The stars are for the 3 other staff that helped me get a refund but Koul needs to be fired and never work in customer service. He blatantly and defiantly wears a pin that says  “ People Suck” I first encountered Koul a few months ago, saw the pin and politely encouraged him to think about not wearing it and he would not only get better tips, but would not draw negative attention his way. He said, “my manager does not mind.” I thought mentioning how offensive it was would cause him to  think about it and he would not wear it. I stopped by today and saw him for the first time in a while, I was not gonna say anything about it  but I saw him whispering to his coworker at the warming stove, laughing and she looked at me to see who he was laughing and talking about. She quickly turned her head as she unexpectedly caught my eye. I told the cashier that I normally would leave a tip but as long as employees are allowed to wear insulting badges like his and laugh and talk about the customers with other employees about my concerns, I would not be leaving a tip. He said, “that’s ok call corporate if you want, I don’t care, “ as he was preparing my mocha. I told him I would and did not want the coffee and I wanted a refund. He smirked as the other workers worked together to figure out the process. WORST EXPERIENCE I’VE EVER HAD AND I’VE BEEN A CUSTOMER SINCE THE 90’s AT VARIOUS PEET’S IN THE BAY AREA. Please follow through and make sure your employees are not insulting your valued customers by wearing such insulting pins!"
Peet's Coffee,I love Peet's. The folks are always so friendly. The coffees are great. If you drink soy milk-- theirs is very good (I hate Starbucks' soymilk 😝).  I also love their seasonal pastries. Good job team!
Peet's Coffee,Excellent service all hours. Staff are courteous and store is very clean and atmospheric. Seating is generous and there's a nice view of the street ways outside. Barristas went above and beyond to help my friend get an iced tea while they were about to close. Excellent bunch!
Peet's Coffee,"Great place, very friendly staff, and delicious drinks. I work nearby, and everytime I come in everyone is so friendly. Some very tasty baked goods as well."
Peet's Coffee,"Very friendly customer service, fast service and my coffee was excellent! Place is clean and very cool to just hang out!"
Peet's Coffee,"Questionable manager: Came in at this location at exactly 5:30pm to hopefully get coffee and use the restroom (tinkle). One of the employees told me that they've just closed and they're not serving anything which I totally understood. I asked him if I could use the restroom real quick and he said ""Yes"". Then the manager stopped me telling me that I wasn't allowed to use the restroom. I told him that I was just gonna be a minute but he still refused to let me use the restroom. Very questionable behavior. I wonder if I looked differently, would his behavior been any different? Would it have killed him to let me use to restroom? I've been going to Peet's and this location specifically for awhile now. Didn't expect that."
Peet's Coffee,Mocha tasted like it had half the normal amount of chocolate. Would have taken it back if I hadn't been parked in red zone. Frittata was good!
Peet's Coffee,"Richard, we are so sorry to hear that you haven't received consistent drinks during your visits to our San Francisco coffee shop. We strive to craft your drink just to your liking. Thank you for sharing about your experience so we can take the opportunity to grow."
Peet's Coffee,"I just want to give a shout out to all the employees here. There a re a few that know exactly what I want and how I want it. And they execute it excellently. I can't thank them enough for being there when I need my fix.  Coconut black tie. Added shot, shot poured on top of the condensed milk , then stirred when it's all said and done."
Peet's Coffee,"Very clean, bright and airy new Peet's Coffee location. Many of the staff are experienced Peet's baristas, having been brought in from other stores.  My coffee companion had only one complaint: he found the plastic seats of the type surrounding the large central meeting table to be uncomfortable. However,  he noted that the wood grain chairs at the smaller tables didn't hurt his back."
Peet's Coffee,"Came here early in morning about a month ago and had to wait for opening time about 15 minutes. When the opening time (listed online and on the door) came, the employees didn’t open it. At first thought they were slow to open so waited an additional 30 minutes and the woman finally opened the door. Only when me and the people waiting tried to walk in, did she tell us they weren’t going to open till 6. The reason we all waited was cause this woman periodically would walk right up to the door, as if to open it, but instead would turn to grab something else and move it, all while smirking every time. She could have told us when she first seen us instead of making us wait 45 minutes in the cold."
Peet's Coffee,Here the customer service and coffee  everything  very good.

Peet's Coffee,"Coffee was good, but my order got lost which made me late for getting back to work. The staff was friendly when I brought it up, but I'm not sure how you lose an order."
