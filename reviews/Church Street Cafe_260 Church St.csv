Church Street Cafe,"Great Coffee, good and reasonably priced, good. Lovely quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Was helped by a gentleman that was manning the register, food and drinks and was knocking it out. Cash only though but there is an ATM as a heads up."
Church Street Cafe,"Church Street Cafe received 5 stars only because I was allowed to use their restroom. I enjoy offering high remarks when deserved. The Cafe has terrible coffee. Bitter, Strong, and indigestible. My heart sank even lower when I received my plain bagel. Lathered in between the bagel was silky, salty cream cheese. 🤢 Yucky. Help Noah's or NY."
Church Street Cafe,5 out of 5 to (1) single asian gentleman who runs the show by himself! In a very nicely kept Cafe placed on the warm n sunny place on market so I giv it up to the dude that's running the joint every Friday I'm there! Good jop.
Church Street Cafe,"Excellent customer service. The owner is very accommodating and personable. Coffees and snacks are good. Fresh OJ. Free Wi-Fi. There is an ATM inside. Artsy walls. The bathroom is one of the best I have seen in the history of all restaurants: clean, modern, installed with a bidet! Outside seating. Limited inside seatings, due to covid, with a power outlet, which is extremely helpful during the pandemic restrictions."
Church Street Cafe,Proprietor is really nice! Their veggie egg bagel is so good and their latte was pretty nice too! Would def be back!
Church Street Cafe,Pretty great spot to meet up with friends or work/study. Nice decors and many tables. Not impressive with the drinks' quality however.
Church Street Cafe,"So many drink options to choose from! I got the boba blended matcha and it was delicious. The barista is funny and it’s a great atmosphere, I imagine this is a great spot to meet friends. It’s cash only so be prepared for that. Definitely coming back. ☺️"
Church Street Cafe,Staff very cordial and patient. Sandwich & latte was good. I found a cafe for this area of city!
Church Street Cafe,Wonderful owner- friendly & kind. Coffee the great. Lots of yummy pastries & bagels- free WiFi . Cozy place with enough space to relax ( Covid rules) small tables out front.friendly neighbor - not intusive . You can hang out as long as you want-- peaceful energy-- nice spot to enjoy Great coffee & treats and relax & can get work done or just play games on iPad etc. Come check it out-
Church Street Cafe,The BEST Boba Matcha Latte! They blend it with the ice like a smoothie! DELICIOUS and super friendly! Charming and quaint!!! I go EVERY day for the boba matcha latte! There is nothing better!!!
Church Street Cafe,Disgusting pastries.  Reheated from frozen and left out for days? Worst lemon bar of my life.
Church Street Cafe,Can’t wait to come back. Cozy vibe.
Church Street Cafe,"Great neighborhood cafe!  Friendly service. Yummy coffee, pastries and great authentic  Banh Mi sandwiches.  Cozy atmosphere with local crowd.  Best cafe in Church St/Castro neighborhoods."
Church Street Cafe,"Great local coffee shop. Good drinks and breakfast, and friendly owners who make you feel welcome to stay and work from the cafe."
Church Street Cafe,"A lovely, quaint neighborhood coffee shop, with a comforting atmosphere. The store keeper was an interesting personality. There were also quite a few notable patrons. The breakfast menu was rather meager. I ordered a croissant, which was pretty tasty even though maybe too greasy. There is a plenty of power outlets. Before coming to work, keep in mind that it's 1) cash only and 2) the wifi code is only good for two hours."
Church Street Cafe,"Great place to get a fast egg sandwich. Coffee is okay, service is really quick. Coffee+sandwich is 8.50 about"
Church Street Cafe,"Love this spot for a stroll in the morning to get coffee and a bagel, they also have great pastries, juices, and Banh Mi! Wanted to leave a review because the owner is so kind and it's places like this that keep San Francisco charming."
Church Street Cafe,"Nice, quiet place to meet a friend and catch up or get some work done. Good coffee and tea selection but it's cash only! There is an ATM but it's rather inconvenient to have to get $20+ fees for a $2.50 cup of tea."
Church Street Cafe,"I'm a regular customer here - the employees got my order down to the point where they just confirm I'm getting the same thing and start making it as I walk through the door.  All of the staff I've interacted with are beyond friendly. Sure, there's a language ""barrier"" at times, but it doesnt bother me. Just try to speak clearly and calmly repeat yourself if needed. The iced coffee is drinkable, but not my favorite. The bagel sandwiches are golden though!!"
Church Street Cafe,"Pretty atmosphere, but the food and drinks are really subpar. The scone I purchased tasty days old. Also, the wifi is slow and time limited. Great that they are open late, so an option if everything else is closed."
Church Street Cafe,"Lovely staff and owner, they are precious Best tofu banh mi in San Francisco, can be made vegan by asking for tomato spread instead of mayo Drinks can be made vegan by asking for almond milk Cleanest bathroom in the city—great experience!"
Church Street Cafe,"It's a quiet coffee place, with a healthy air flow..inside. There are tables for those who prefer out door..this place even has some gluten free treats..for people like me..their toilet room is clean, too. That is a big plus..besides the staff is sweet😊 …"
Church Street Cafe,"Lots of seating, and most of the time not super busy. Plenty of space to work on your laptop. The people at the cash always seem a little indifferent and don't speak much. Do NOT order the bubble tea. They put the pearls in the fridge or something. Hard pearls sunk inside of the bland slush. Cash only! There is an old book store nearby in case you are bored."
Church Street Cafe,"Delicious Bahn mi! They offer coffee, boba tea, breakfast sandwiches too. I always see regulars sitting outside whenever I go. The vegetarian bahn mi is just as good as their meat options so it’s got something for everyone. Bring cash!"
Church Street Cafe,Nice place to hang out. You have to ask the cashier for a Wi-Fi password each time you go. Clean bathrooms. The wait staff are efficient but don't seem to take any pleasure at all and interacting with other human beings.  They look sad and sullen.
Church Street Cafe,Best breakfast sandwich in town
Church Street Cafe,"This was my go to place. But since more trendy places opened up the neighborhood Church Street Cafe now seems old and dated. Most of the employees don't speak good English, they don't do cold brew, they are too tolerant with homeless, employees spend too much time behind the counter and not cleaning tables or the condiment station. They also have horrible coffee handling practices. Brewing new coffee on top of old, letting coffee sit for hours, not grinding fresh espresso per drink, and not offering multiple brews.  Their tea menu is a mix of every tea bag available in San Francisco. I question how fresh they are and the quality.  Church Street Cafe needs to modernize quickly else it will go down with the aging population that holds it afloat."
Church Street Cafe,"Yummy coffee. Good variety of pastries. Even have hard boiled eggs for a healthy snack. More importantly their bathroom is part of the Access2Go and let me tell you, that is an experience in an of itself. Touchless everything from bathroom, flushing, hand washing, soap dispensing, hand drying and finally exiting. Everything touchless. Amazing."
Church Street Cafe,"The owner and the atmosphere remain my favorite features these past few years. In 2008 I used to go every week, and this year I'm back to the same habit. Happily, nothing I loved has changed (not even the prices as far as I can tell) and the ""problem"" with homeless seems to have been dealt with. I love how productive I am here!"
Church Street Cafe,"Service is great. Definitely reasonable prices for all your morning rush needs plus banh mi sandwiches and tapioca drinks. Family-owned & operated, a true mom+pop."
Church Street Cafe,"Clean and quiet with plenty of seating. The coffee is passable with lots of different choices. Cash only, but there is an ATM inside. You must ask the barista for a paper with your temporary wifi login and password and the wifi is pretty slow. You also ask the barista for a barcode to scan to use the bathroom."
Church Street Cafe,"Absolutely love this place. Fair prices on everything on the menu, food and coffee are superb, and an all around great vibe. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice spot to do some work or just want to kick back for a little bit!"
Church Street Cafe,"Church St. Café is a pretty nice place.  Fresh pastries, hot made-to-order bagel sandwiches, good fresh coffee.  Kudos to them for using ceramic cups for ""for here"" coffee.  I just wish that they had pull-down shading for their windows when that morning sun comes in their windows.  It can be blinding sitting there."
Church Street Cafe,"I've been coming here since college (formerly called Muddy Waters), and have witnessed the change in ownership. Conveniently located near Church Station, it is an excellent place to duck into for several cups of tea,  a visit to the loo, and/or to immediately dive into that just-picked-up book from Aardvark's. New owners are super, and hence the reason I still continue to wander in. When I manage to snag a corner table, I park myself for hours to get some work done, or catch up on offline/online reading."
Church Street Cafe,"Family owned. Excellent location half a block from Muni Church street train station. Delicious coffee. Great ambiance. Good cookies, sandwiches, candy, biscotti, bagels, cakes and pies. Friendly ambiance and very reasonable prices.2 tables out doors. WiFi"
Church Street Cafe,Nice place. It was not be noisy like some cafes and a good variety of food and beverages. The employee was a bit  distant but that's ok. Bathroom was unusually clean - big 😀 for that. …
Church Street Cafe,"Great Cafe, only cash though :/"
Church Street Cafe,Unassuming little shop with polite staff. 5.00 will get you a cream cheese bagel and small drip coffee. WiFi is free (ask them for a login) and decent speed. Lots of seating but limited power outlets. I will come back.
Church Street Cafe,Kudos for opening pass 6 pm. Place to hang out with friends and take in some sweet desserts or tea.  Mellow and decompress from work.  Forget about local bars.  Grab a cookie or two. That lemon bar sure looks yummy (4.95).  Bun mi sandwich.
Church Street Cafe,It is coffee shop within table inside. My price is fairly. Only cash no credit card. The food is alright.
Church Street Cafe,"I walked past this place a few times, thinking how lovely it looked inside. But when I finally went in, I was pretty disappointed. Not a great range, uninterested barrista, awkwardly passworded wifi, and worst, you needed an app on your phone just to use the restroom!"
Church Street Cafe,Good strawberry boba
Church Street Cafe,"Great bahn mi sandwiches.  Hank makes a wide variety of coffees, teas and bubble drinks."
Church Street Cafe,"Cash only, and ATM was down so had to go down the street to use another business's machine. Other than that, standard quality I would expect from an SF cafe."

Church Street Cafe,"Quiet, neighborhoody place for coffee and sandwiches. Nice owner & staff.  My favorite in the neighborhood."
Church Street Cafe,"I got my chai order wrong and they denied to make a new one and blamed me. Rude service. (Friday 8.30 pm). Also, consider this place only allows cash. Atm  2.75$ extra charge. It's unfortunate because the place is really nice."
Church Street Cafe,"- Lots of tables but can get crowded in the evenings - Cash only, but there's an ATM inside - Free wifi but you have to ask for a code that expires after 2 hours - One block away from Church Street Station - Good for getting work done - Lots of outlets at the tables around the perimeter"
