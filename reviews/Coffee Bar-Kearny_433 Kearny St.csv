Coffee Bar-Kearny,This coffee shop is seriously underrated. I feel like the go above and beyond to make each of their drinks special by making the syrups in house. I’ve so far tried the caramel and vanilla lattes and the horchata cold brew and it’s been all been great. I get the horchata cold brew with 2/3 horchata and 1/3 regular cold brew and find it to be the best drink ever. The service is great too and it’s in a prime location 🤙🏽
