South Beach Cafe,"I love this place, have been going there for a long time, and feel at home (or even better on a trip to Italy) when I go there! The pizza, pannini, desserts, coffee, and drinks are all awesome. You can park there easily, get to Bay Bridge or freeway or the ballpark very easily. My go to place when in SF!"
South Beach Cafe,"Sunny corner cafe with outdoor seating and a view of the water! We ordered the vegetarian egg and cheese sandwich that had the most fluffy eggs. The owner very kindly cut it in half and brought it on two separate plates for us even though we didn't ask. Thank you, we will be frequenting this place more often!"
South Beach Cafe,"South Beach Cafe has been my 5 star place for over 20 years. Everything on the food menu has been sampled by me. The Cafe is clean, comfortable and spacious. The owner and his wife are very friendly and understand the SOMA culture. The location is on point for people watching, nature, and relaxing for a drink. I recommend the pizza of any style. The sandwiches are made to order and the bread is a type of ciabatta. For a quick breakfast, I usually order the scrambled eggs."
South Beach Cafe,"Fantastic food, friendly staff and great value"
South Beach Cafe,"Overpriced and horrible food. Ordered a scrambled eggs plate and received an extremely small portion for what I paid, the hash browns were comparable to McDonalds and I only received three tiny pieces of bread. Ordered two hot chocolates, half were just filled with foam and had no taste. The service was also bad, the man running the shop had a bad attitude, and there was no restroom open for customers. Will never come here again."
South Beach Cafe,"The soccer game was playing on TV. I ate inside because there was a chill in the air outside. The owner, bearing a slight resemblance to Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan, prepared the pizza: sausage and cheese accented with some basil leaves. The ambience was homey. It could have used more diners for a bit more busyness. However, I do think the 12 inch pizza in four slices was delicious."
South Beach Cafe,"Beautiful place with outdoor sitting, great atencion ,delicious food and coffee. Best tiramisu ever!!!"
South Beach Cafe,"It's a ' Unique Little Gem ' on The S.F. Embarcadero ' with Beautiful Water Views and a Couple,  Three tables Outdoors !!! The "" Tiramisu "" Italian Dessert is to die for !!! The Couple who owns it are very "" Kind & Neighborly "". A neighborhood ' Small Business ' worth supporting !!!!"
South Beach Cafe,"Lovely owners. Great views. A place with a character. The food items seem like a standard breakfast / sandwich (and pizza!) fare, but are made with love - not your usual, generic sandwich. I got a tuna sandwich, served with salad - very delicious.  Fast wifi available, though this is not a place to sit and work all day (but good for an hour or two when waiting)."
South Beach Cafe,"To say I was in a horrible mood today is not to say anything. But it all changed the minute I walked into the South Beach Cafe and tried their Lasagna. It was so incredibly delicious! They have all kinds of sandwiches, "" designer "" pizzas- even their bread that comes with Lasagna is so soft and yummy. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys fantastic food at a reasonable price."
South Beach Cafe,"Breakfast is not so good. The server, which I assume is the owner, was rude. For example, I asked for Tabasco, and he just pointed to it on a shelf. I ordered a mocha, but it didn’t have any chocolate in it. The banana bread was stale. The bathroom does not work. Yikes!!! I am never coming back."
South Beach Cafe,This place is hit or miss. The lady that served us weeks ago was great and courteous and the food was great. The older guy that helped us today was grumpy and made rushed horrid lattes.
South Beach Cafe,Decent pizza and service but the best of all is the view and fresh air. Had the chicken pesto pizza. It was light and crunchy but the chicken was a bit too bland.
South Beach Cafe,"I was served by the older gentleman, whom I can see from other comments is usually the recipient of one-star reviews. He told me it would take 20 minutes to make scrambled eggs. The food was mediocre at best. Reminds me of something I might have gotten in a middle school cafeteria once. The man behind the counter was rude. I gave a friendly ""thanks, have a good one!"" on the way out and he just stared blankly as I walked to the door."
South Beach Cafe,Went there today with my friend. Lovely ambiance. The food was good! Definitely great location
South Beach Cafe,"What a great place, with an outstanding environment, but.... staff was unapologetic about their rude behavior toward every customer. With an understanding of personal life and what it has on an employees work environment. A gentlemen in the front who has no care in the world did not allow me to order and when I did he stared at me and rushed me as if he was staring at a computer screen. Robot that’s on overdrive. Until I see some change to the staff or even management this will stay at 1 Star. There are a ton better places to choose from with WiFi and better staff that will make it worth enjoying sometime with someone or work."
South Beach Cafe,"Firstly, no one was at the counter when i arrived. When finally my order was taken, I saw that the milk jug was left open. They made coffee out of that milk, not sure for how long that was left there unattended. Completely unhygienic! Never coming back"
South Beach Cafe,Wonderful place with excellent pizzas (Italian!) - highly recommended.
South Beach Cafe,This was so delicious. The lady serving was beyond welcoming and awesome. The food was so authentic and filling. The sandwiches are so tasty and the desserts are phenomenal!
South Beach Cafe,"Lovely little quiet place to go to on a Sunday. This sandwich with prosciutto, mozzarella, and egg on focaccia was a very nice flavor blend when it was all together. Prices feel competitive. I’ll be back."
South Beach Cafe,Great location and outstanding cappuccino! The pizza menu looks enticing too so I'll probably be back later today.
South Beach Cafe,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I'd still want to give them 7. The top of the scale just isn't enough. The pizzas were good. Really good. But the lasagna was mind blowing. Probably the best lasagna I've had. The hazelnut truffle: amazing. The canoli? More flavor than I've ever had in a canoli. Tiramisu? Amazing. But better than the food was the service. Some of the best service I've ever had. We were there for a birthday, and our lovely host ran outside for a hot minute to find a lighter to light some birthday candles. I don't live in SF, but this has been my favorite of many outstanding food experiences during my visit. I'll be back."
South Beach Cafe,"I had a great italian experience, like if I were at a restaurant back home. Thank you! Pizza napoletana is fantastic!"
South Beach Cafe,"This is a nice little café with a good selection. They have pizzas, sandwiches, and salads as well as breakfast foods and other entrees. The prices are very reasonable and the food is quality. They also have a nice drink selection. A welcoming atmosphere right along the embarcadero. One of my favorite spots in the neighborhood"
South Beach Cafe,"I visited South Beach Café early in the morning, the staff were very accommodating. They let me seat with my bags, shared their wifi and gave me very good service. I also witnessed them give assistance to other strangers who requested for it. The place is hip and their menu is also very pocket friendly"
South Beach Cafe,Great outdoor city place across from the south beach Harbor where you can bring your Dog and enjoy the nice CA weather
South Beach Cafe,1st time ever coming here with my co workers. I’m truly disappointed on the quality of the food is so disappointing. If I could ever give you negative star i would!!!
South Beach Cafe,"I asked if they had omelettes and was told yea by the older gentleman at the counter. I asked for bacon, he said they didn’t have any. I asked for sausage, tomato, and onion. The guy replied, “let’s not make this complicated “.  Not sure how a breakfast place making an omelette with tomato and onion is complicated. So I left"
South Beach Cafe,The onwer of this store is the sweetest woman you'll ever meet. I brought 30 people in yesterday all at once and it was just her working but she brought delicious pizzas out QUICK. 10/10 would go there again.
South Beach Cafe,Recommended friends to eat here and they got not so nice service. I’m sad that it has changed
South Beach Cafe,Delicious breakfast sandwich. Tables outdoor provide safe social distancing.
South Beach Cafe,Reasonably priced and metered street parking available. I ordered a dry breve cappuccino and a turkey and cheese sandwich. Both were delicious!!! Minus 1 star because customer service could have been better.
South Beach Cafe,Nice little corner shop with some of the most beautiful view of the SF Bay Bridge. Lovely service. I think the cashier men could smile some...but then again... he also looks old school. Respectful. Great food. A must have!
South Beach Cafe,"Stopped in for a nice sandwich for, sausage pizza for my son, freshly cooked Ravioli for my Daughter and wow… very good food.  A small mom and pop place the food is cooked while you wait, worth it."
South Beach Cafe,Went here for a concert at oracle Park and glad we walked a but further to find this shop. The pizza was so fresh and not greasy like anywhere else. I live an hour and a half away and would drive back just for more pizza
South Beach Cafe,Great local spot.  Esp love the red sauce on pizza.  Wine prices very reasonable.  Casual and easy.
South Beach Cafe,"Incredible made-to-order personal pizzas starting at $12/pie. While the restaurant interior is not much to write home about, the high quality ingredients combined with exceptional service from the restaurant owner will motivate anyone to try South Beach Cafe at least once (and twice... and so on).  This would be a five star review, although recently a GrubHub “Chicken Caesar Salad” takeout order was discovered to be missing the chicken 😅"
South Beach Cafe,Great Coffee and even better cakes.....my Wife and I loved it .....The Italian lady serving us the day we went was a lovely host.
South Beach Cafe,"Good dishes and services at a reasonable price.  They mainly serve pizzas and sandwiches, both were good. South Beach pizza had tasty prosciutto on a thin crispy crust. Turkey sandwich had a lot of turkey ham.  Soccer fans might enjoy eating and watching a soccer match on their TV."
South Beach Cafe,"Reasonable prices, fast service and a variety of tasty dishes."
South Beach Cafe,South Beach has a really good menu and everything is good. My wife goes nuts over the Tuna salad and the pizza is the real deal. I traveled a lot in Europe and whatever city in Italy you ate the pizza was the same. Great and just like South Beach. I can't go in there without getting a pizza. All of the staff knows you by name after a couple of visits. And you know their name. If you think of that little place in your neighborhood where everyone knows your name it's South Beach. Don't miss it. Michael Flora
South Beach Cafe,"Such a sweet little spot by the water.    The Cafe is owned by an older Italian couple who know their pizza!    So glad I discovered this unique, authentic Cafe."
South Beach Cafe,Wonderful place to hang out enjoy some Food and Cocktails great service. Know this place forever and they know how it has to be done. See you next time👍😎 …
South Beach Cafe,"The South Beach Cafe is a good location for those who want to remain close to AT&T park but still want to distance yourself from a lot of the crowd.  This place is almost always guaranteed to be open when you're there to catch the game.  But beware, if there is a soccer game going on, good luck finding a seat because it's going to be packed.  Food selection is more around pizza, salad, sandwiches, and breakfast items. I would try out the pizza, it's flat thin crust that is pretty decent. However, the down side is that it's not always consistent - so it depends on how many people there.  Breakfast is decent, but a bit overpriced in my opinion. And they serve salad with their breakfast (if you order the eggs). It's strange for breakfast, but at least you'll get your veggies.  Coffee is iffy. I don't like it because it tastes too watered down, but I haven't tried it in awhile, so maybe it was just a bad brew ehen I got it?  Overall, this place is more of a convenience of location. If you are willing to go a bit further, check out Towns End or Crossroads Cafe."
South Beach Cafe,"Good service, and tasty thin crust pizza.. 👍🏽😁 …"
South Beach Cafe,It was a quick bite stop for me and my friend on our first day in the city for a job interview. I won't judge this restaurant on this particular meal. I liked the ambience and Bruschetta I ordered. Bathroom was little filthy but this could be one-off day for them.
South Beach Cafe,Cozy little Italian cafe. Fantastic pizza and salads. Been coming here for years and it has not changed at all. Very reasonable prices and value. Especially for being in a high rent area. Take out or eat it there.  Outside or inside table seating is available. Opens early for breakfast and closes late. Good place for coffee and desserts too.  This place has never left me disappointed.
South Beach Cafe,"One of my favorite places for breakfast or lunch. The ownership is really nice. They really want you to be at home. They show most of the soccer games here, and there is a local Champions League crowd that shows up up on Tuesday's and Wednesday. The food is really good, and they have local specials."
South Beach Cafe,"Great Authentic Italian pizzas, sandwiches and salads. The spot is great, it reminds you of European small size restaurants. The owners and workers are super nice there. I used to go there with FCBarcelona Penya Members to watch our team play soccer. They used to host us as if we were family. Highly recommend this place and their food! #TEAMBARCA"
South Beach Cafe,I had a mortadella sandwich and my friends had the prosciutto pizza. It was good and so was the Italian beer and espresso. We sat outside and ate. Owners were very nice.
South Beach Cafe,"Always fresh, always friendly and accommodating. This place is a perfect example of a neighborhood cafe run by a nice family. I never miss an opportunity to stop by there when I am in the area. If you are a coffee lover you'll appreciate the Lavazza coffee they're serving."
South Beach Cafe,Very interesting place.  Its like a cafe during the day and Italian restaurant at night.  Too bad it really doesn't work.  I don't trust the quality of the drinks to get a latte here.  They don't have a pastry case to make it feel like a cafe.  And when I ordered a breakfast sandwich they cooked it in a pizza oven.  Customer service was lacking.
South Beach Cafe,Went in this past Saturday morning.  The place was empty and now I see why.  Food quality is worse than anything in the neighborhood.  Hard to imagine how this place exists.  Coffee was also terrible and the old maskless man behind the counter was rude.  Too bad as this is a great location.
South Beach Cafe,"Well to start off with, food and drinks are overpriced. The personal pizza i orders was good however. Decided to have dessert after. got a slice of the last peace. Took a bit and it was no good (hard and no flavor as per week old) Oh and to top it off my friend pointed out there was a hair on it. i give it a 3 star only because the pizza was ok and the service was good and people were friendly. But dont think i will be back."
South Beach Cafe,Great homey restaurant. Casual dining. Sports tv always following the latest attractions. Great food ( pizza is outstanding) all homemade recipes. Friendly  and welcoming feeling. Dog friendly...outdoor tables as well. Free parking in the general area.
South Beach Cafe,"This is like an inexpensive trip to a small neighborhood in Italy!  There's European soccer on the television (volume thoughtfully turned off), thin crust pizza's, homemade lasagna, desserts to die for and wonderful inexpensive Italian wines to go with it all.  The proprietors are terrific people, too!"
South Beach Cafe,Great place to grab a pizza. Their Napolitano pizzas are excellent. The staff are great to deal with and care about their customers. Have been by myself and with the family. We truly appreciate them.
South Beach Cafe,Went here with some friends during Fleet Week after missing our train back to San Jose in the afternoon. Atmosphere was chill and the staff was pretty nice. Our pizza was really good as well!
South Beach Cafe,"Authentic Italian specialties cooked up by real Italians and service with a smile. Love the Margherita pizza, which rivals the ones I've had in Sorrento and Naples.  Great coffee too, and they make you feel right at home. There's outdoor seating available, a plus if you want to dine with your dog, and great location at The Embarcadero and Townsend. Give this place a try, you'll be back for more."
South Beach Cafe,A hidden gem near the baseball stadium. Perhaps the best thin crust authentic Italian pizza in SF.
South Beach Cafe,"Best Italian cafe spot in south beach, san francisco. Two blocks from the ballpark and right on the water. Their cannolis are the best and filled through. haha. Not like some north beach spots. Pizza and cannellonis pasta is amazing as well. Our penya (supporter's club #teambarca #fcbarcelona) meets here for matches. The atmosphere and great food are the perfect combination. A true family restaurant."
South Beach Cafe,"Yuc. Hated it. I ordered the Cannelloni, it was served cold. The stuffed pasta contained cold ricotta cheese and either raw or powdered garlic, it gave me heartburn. It was then topped with cold, chopped tomatoes and four slivers of un-melted Parmesan cheese. Not at all what I expected. The whole thing might have been better of it was baked for a five minutes. I had three bites and that was enough to give me the worst heartburn, ever. We also ordered the Caesar salad which was full of water and barely had any dressing. What little dressing they did put on the Caesar salad had absolutely no flavor. I was so hungry, I ate the salad and a few bites of the Cannelloni, but I wish I had not. This might be a nice place to stop for a plain sandwich at lunch, but the dinner service was awful. The owner might be Italian but there is nothing authentic about the food. She should take a look at things before they go to the tables and please, rethink the recipes. My daughter's Caprese Sandwich was okay, but nothing special. It was bland and again, half baked. Cold hunks of Mozzarella cheese and less than desirable, cold tomatoes. I hope they get tit together, it's a cute spot. The menu looked great but it seems like nobody cares about the food. No heart, no soul, no flavor."
South Beach Cafe,"Nice little Italian style cafe with traditional thin crust pizza, salads, sandwiches etc.  Good cappuccino & plenty of seating inside and out.  It's informal so great option for lunch or before/after a Giants game."
South Beach Cafe,"Very chill vibe. Great food, nicely priced, and friendly staff. Super cold and fair priced brew. Great place to watch a FC Barcelona game! Awesome views! Located conveniently."
South Beach Cafe,It's conveniently located near AT&T park but the food wasn't that great. The pizza was nothing to rave about and the salad is definitely something I would not get again. A place to go if you really don't have any other choice in the area.
South Beach Cafe,"Now THIS is real pizza -- Nothing like the corporate cardboard crusts you'd get from the big brands. Great pricing, quick service, and views you can't beat!"
South Beach Cafe,Perfect little spot to have a quick bite before. Giants game! Food was delicious and ran by very sweet Italians! I love this place and will definitely go back again when I'm on the Embarcadero.
South Beach Cafe,"Great little gem for authentic Italian fare and coffee.  Very friendly service and delicious food.  I got their homemade asparagus, mushroom soup and it was amazing!"
South Beach Cafe,"Had the best breakfast here. Food was ready very fast, clean and tasty! They been so nice about my special request on the food and the service was excellent. Thank you!"
South Beach Cafe,"Honestly I’ve not want to leave a great review because this is one of my favorite lunch/cafes in San Francisco one block from the baseball stadium on the corner of Townsend and King Street (Embarcadero). Great food and drinks, outdoor seating, great views, good prices."
South Beach Cafe,Its a casual place to hang out on the Embarcadero. The portions were on the small side but the food was very tasty. Its not very expensive. There are tables outside that you can sit at and people watch. The service is great as they do bend over backwards to make sure you have everything you need.
South Beach Cafe,"This is the second time i've been here. The staff is incredibly friendly, food is great with a large selection, and the atmosphere is great. Outside seating has a beautiful view of the bay and marina. Highly recommend!!"
South Beach Cafe,"South Beach Cafe is a casual, fun little cafe right on the Embarcadero with views of the bay and a short walk from both the Ferry Building and AT&T Park.  There is definitely nothing fancy about this spot, just good food, a few small TV's and some great people watching on a nice day.  I especially like their breakfast options although their lunch is good too.  Pretty reasonably priced food and great views make this worth the stop on a sunny San Francisco weekend."
South Beach Cafe,"We got everything to-go thanks to the shelter in place order. We got pizza for breakfast! The scrambled egg was more of a yummy, fluffy frittata, and the ham egg cheese croissant was a huge portion."
South Beach Cafe,Dreadful place.... Really rude old bloke serving... No mask.  Seemed a burden to serve us. Didn't even take our order properly so we paid and left it.  Only put 1 star as couldn't put zero.  Stay clear....
South Beach Cafe,Great place to have lunch and watch international football (soccer).
South Beach Cafe,quiet place. Real Madrid on TV. The lady has been running it 30 years. Mocca and tiramesu.
South Beach Cafe,South Beach Cafe is like a little Italian cafe in SF. Great salads & pizzas and you can get breakfast most of the days too. Outdoor seating for nice days. Soccer is usually on.
South Beach Cafe,It would be nice if...  #1: Food wasn't cold. #2: Pesto tasted like pesto. #3: Chicken didn't look like shredded KFC.  But my company ordered it. It was free. So thanks for the free cold meal.
South Beach Cafe,It's a small little cafe on Townsend. I love going there Everytime I visit SF. Their tiramisu is the best I have ever had and I have very high standards for Tiramisu. Highly recommend trying it.
South Beach Cafe,"Love this little place.  It is close to the ballpark. They have great veggie pizza.  They serve brunch and lunch and dinner. Small place, great vibe, good food and prices."
South Beach Cafe,"This is a perfect lunch or breakfast place for people who work in the area. Good food, wide-ranging menu, and there's always European soccer on an HD TV. The service style can take some getting used to."
South Beach Cafe,Staff is very friendly and prices are fair. Highly recommended!
South Beach Cafe,"Great pizza place. The owner creates real Italian feel. Great casual breakfast, lunch, and dinner place. They serve fondu on Wednesdays!"
South Beach Cafe,"Tasty brunch food all day.  Service is quick.  Walk up and order, pick a table, and your order comes to you."
South Beach Cafe,Stopped by to grab a quick bite before heading home. My ravioli was delicious and the owner was very polite. I highly recommend this place!!
South Beach Cafe,Skip this place.  The guy’s incredibly rude and the food is just okay. He forgot the sausage in my breakfast sandwich and snapped at me when I kindly asked for it to be added.
South Beach Cafe,"Me nd mi husband met up nd decided to eat here, they have good food nd they aren’t that pricey either . After we took pics across from the restaurant . ☺️🍕🌊🥤⛴💓🤴🏾👸🏽 …"
South Beach Cafe,"Very nice Italian owners, I enjoyed the sandwich selection. There are vegetarian options too."
South Beach Cafe,"Nice place for lunch. Good food, clean place and reasonable prices. The soup could have been hotter, but it was more than worth it."
South Beach Cafe,My boyfriend and I go there every week. The salads are out of this world! Very kind Italian owners.
South Beach Cafe,"Disgusting. One person with an attitude running the place who clearly did not want to be there, food is mediocre as well, we took couple bites and left."
South Beach Cafe,Went for breakfast 3 times while we were staying at Hotel Via. Really great service and good Italian coffee. Good value as well.
South Beach Cafe,The pizzas are decent value for money. The ambiance and vibe are nice
South Beach Cafe,Amazing tiramisu. Will be back just for that! Hot chocolate tastes like a powder mix; would recommend you skip it. Didn't try anything else.
South Beach Cafe,"Love this neighborhood restaurant. Fresh pizzas, delicious croissants with eggs and cheese and simple salads with a wonderful vinegrette dressing."
South Beach Cafe,They have the best antipasto I have had in SF. We'll go back to try the rest of their Italian dishes.
South Beach Cafe,"Very nice little place, the people were very friendly and cared to make it a nice experience. I could eat braekfast, lunch and dinner at this place plus you can get something to drink with all three meals!!"
South Beach Cafe,"A nice little cafe that is low key, yet serves excellent food.  The breakfast was delicious & a sufficient amount for a great price. It is highly suggested"

South Beach Cafe,"The salad was nothing exceptional, but their pizza is pretty good! Thin crust. Service is fast."

South Beach Cafe,"We went to this site because they show FC Barcelona matches and that day the historic match against PSG was played where they came back 6-1. The place is very good, the pizza we ordered and the mozzarella salad were delicious, although I will never forget it because of the historical football game we saw."
