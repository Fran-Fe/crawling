Enter The Cafe,"🤩While there is certainly a taste benefit that comes from sipping ❤️ red heart dragon fruit yogurt, there can also be a bounty of health benefits too. All of which can give your body an awesome pick-me-up.😎👍🏻"
Enter The Cafe,"This is a cute corner Cafe that serves interesting drinks. Its definitely a family owned cafe because you can see their kids playing games and one doing homework, that’s always the sign of a family business!  Now to the drink! I had the ‘Straw to my Berry’ yogurt drink. It was sooo good! 10/10  I loved the strawberry flavor with ACTUAL strawberry pieces in it with every sip, definitely would get again.  It took a bit to get out but it’s being made fresh so I can’t really complain on that front. I would recommend people who like yogurt drinks to come here and try it out!  *There is also delivery available and there is indoor seating to eat and drink! They accept CCs, tap to pay and cash!"
Enter The Cafe,"This cafe is supper busy with very friendly and efficient staff.  They distinguish themselves by their unique East-West taste and ingredients and colourful presentation . Great flavors, and while I was waiting, so many people have ordered their Yomie’s yogurt drinks, too (see their signature purple rice yogurt drink)!  I had the egg wrap (terrific flavor) and the Açaí bowl. Definitely want to come back!"
Enter The Cafe,"Enter the Cafe and eat one of their delivered baked goods that are made locally and by a artisanal bakery. The owners are here on site if you have any questions regarding how to get your hands on these hard to get pastries. They have exceptionally tasty drinks and my favorite is the White🔥Fire with cayenne pepper, coconut and honey in espresso."
Enter The Cafe,Ordered delivery and it was the saddest lox bagel and chai latte I’ve ever had. Bagel said it came with onions and capers but they were nowhere to be seen. Not worth 12$. They also misread or ignored my delivery instructions. Disappointing since reviews in person seem like a much better experience
Enter The Cafe,Best breakfast sandwiches I’ve ever had. Coffee is also delicious! Fun for something indulgent
Enter The Cafe,Different from the regular boba I always get. Yogurt drink it really thick.  Tasty n probably better for you. I had the strawberry this time n the dragon fruit last time. Both were great.  I'l be back.
Enter The Cafe,"Clean, quiet place with good, millenial snacks and drinks. A nice change from the other traditional bakery/cafes in Chinatown. The guava smoothie was very smooth and packed a punch. Their white fire latte (honey, coconut milk, cayenne pepper) was creative and tasty - it was more like a cappuccino really, with lots of microfoam which is exactly what I like. Mochi waffles were chewy and slightly sticky, though the Thai tea flavour could be stronger. Other items on the menu all look good and I know I'll be back to try them!"
Enter The Cafe,"Made to order mochi waffles (moffle) was delicious! Crispy on the outside with a soft, chewiness inside and just the right touch of sweetness. Enjoyed the Mitchell’s Ice cream on top - chocolate and green tea! Service was friendly and we are looking forward to visiting again! Also, their wall art is alone worth the visit... :)"
Enter The Cafe,"Great yogurt drinks, reasonable price, service is fast, and they have a clean bathroom"
Enter The Cafe,"A cool idea to make waffles out of Mochi.  Pretty tasty and a real interesting texture.  The coffee was great too, with Intelligencia beans"
Enter The Cafe,Super friendly service. Food and drink was well made and delicious!
Enter The Cafe,"Didn’t see any milk tea on the menu like some other reviews had mentioned, but I did have a super delicious iced tea here, with actual fruit chunks inside. Nice little spot to grab a tasty drink and perhaps get some work done too."
Enter The Cafe,The “Big Wrap” was absolutely DISGUSTING. Didn’t add avocado . Didn’t add my modifications. It’s 50% DRY tortilla. Literally thought it was a joke . There’s no way they’re actually charging people for this kind of sh%t
Enter The Cafe,Cute little cafe in Chinatown! The moffle is suppose to be delicious! The egg in a frame was great! We will be back soon!
Enter The Cafe,"Best breakfast location in San Fransisco.  The owners are delightful, the food and ice cream are outstanding.  I will be a regular during every visit to the city."
Enter The Cafe,I ordered matcha waffle and chai latte. Very tasty.
Enter The Cafe,"Awesome breakfast sandwich! Order the standard Wake Up (Bacon/Egg/Cheese) on a Brioche with avocado and they hooked it up very nicely. It was loaded with bacon, nearly a full avo with great presentation! Thank you :)"
Enter The Cafe,"I loved this place. Their mural outside caught my attention and the inside didn’t disappoint. I love their look, their place, and their aesthetics. The employees were very helpful and friendly too! Would definitely stop by again next time I’m around!  We had the croissants by BakerDoe while we were there! Yummy!"
Enter The Cafe,"The açaí bowls are divine. Truly immaculate taste with rich flavor. Not overly sweet and perfect amount of fruit and granola.  Every time I go, I get the açaí bowl; must try! The avocado toast with poached egg (or any other style of egg) is great too. The avocado is fresh and the poached egg melts in your mouth.  The cafe also offers numerous options for delivery as well like door dash, uber eats etc. I order from here every week. It’s become my favorite cafe."
Enter The Cafe,"Delicious sandwich and cappuccino, very friendly staff. I like their blue plates =)"
Enter The Cafe,Stopped here for a quick bite when we first arrived in Chinatown and couldn't have been happier! Ordered the Matcha Moffle with Cookies & Cream icecream and it was AMAZING. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Would come here again!
Enter The Cafe,Very nice new cafe. The staff are super friendly and feel pretty energized to make it a success. I had a very tasty latte to go from here. They also have a number of tables indoors if you want to sit there.
Enter The Cafe,Just had a ridiculous experience at this place. Popped in there and ordered a tea thinking it would be quick and it took over 15 minutes before I just had to leave - I don’t even know how long it ended up taking to be made. And there were 7 employees working there!
Enter The Cafe,"cute, lesser-known spot in the neighborhood that serves mochi-waffles, ice cream, and milk tea. they have seating inside, so it's a good place to rest your feet. you can eat here for dessert and hop over to the chinatown library a couple blocks away"
Enter The Cafe,High quality food.  I order the bacon breakfast sandwich and the acai bowl. The bacon is crispy and the sandwich is perfect. The acai bowl is refreshing and the fruit is sweet and ripe.  Highly recommend Enter the Cafe.
Enter The Cafe,Mochi waffle with green tea ice cream. Super delicious and surprisingly light.
Enter The Cafe,"Delicious coffee, nice decor, friendly staff, and fair prices."
Enter The Cafe,"The name of this place makes me think of ""Enter The Dragon"", Bruce Lee's last known movie before his death July 20th, 1973. Shoot, I wasn't even born yet lol. Enter The Cafe is just a regular cafe with daily morning danishes and pastries, but not limited to. Seating is limited to ten for the place, and there's no WiFi yet. They've ice cream by (Hometown Creamery), and mochi waffles (3 flavors) available. Pastries are $2-3.75, with kouign amann as premium seller. Coffee beans are grinded per cup order depending if it's drip or espresso. Currently they've a soft opening promotion of free iced tea or coffee with pastries purchase. I'll wait for new items added to menu. As of now, it doesn't appear to be ready for prime time. I'm Albertino representing city by the bay district B-6 (SF), and marketing/advertising is my specialty."
Enter The Cafe,"The matcha mochi waffle with ube ice cream was amazing!! I will definitely be back for that, and also to try the special croissants they have on Saturdays"
Enter The Cafe,The waffles with ice cream were good
Enter The Cafe,"I give them 1 star rating cuz they’re hella slow. The staff need to work fast and quick. All the time I went there to pick up an order, it takes me about 35 to 40 minutes."
Enter The Cafe,The owners of this brand new cafe are extremely nice and the cold brew is delicious! Went for the soft opening. Excited to see how the place develops!
Enter The Cafe,Good coffee; food prices seem a little high but I guess reasonable for the area. Interior is rather plain; could use more variety of seating.
Enter The Cafe,Not really a coffee place. They specialize in yogurt/smoothies and have an espresso machine. Try elsewhere for coffee.

Enter The Cafe,"If you’re looking for breakfast or brunch, I highly recommend you visit Enter The Cafe. And if you like sweet breakfast options or just like waffles in general, you must try the Chocolate Mochi Waffle with some ice cream. The flavor and the texture were consistent, and they don’t turn soggy like with traditional waffles.  You will not need syrup with this. The vanilla ice cream complements the chocolate flavor of the mochi waffle, so I would also recommend that you try this combination.  This place easily earns 5 Stars and comes highly recommended.  I’m hooked now! 🧇😋"
Enter The Cafe,That didn't really appeal to us from the ambience and the guests.
Enter The Cafe,Everything tastes good. Prices rather upper average
Enter The Cafe,very useful
