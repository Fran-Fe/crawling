Rose's Cafe,"Wonderful morning brunch atmosphere. Great service and beautiful vibes. Stars for the atmosphere. The pizza is a thin bread with a few slices of salmon, not worth it for the price. The french toast was completely bread putting, but it was a wonderful dessert. Overall great place to stop if you are near by, just overpriced."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for your kind words!  We appreciate the feedback.
Rose's Cafe,"Very friendly and attentive staff. Really enjoyed the smoked salmon pizza. Drip coffee was fine, too. A bit surprised when breakfast for two came out to $100, but such is life."
Rose's Cafe,"We were sat immediately and the service was lovely; we ordered the salmon cozy, poached egg and chicken sausage, and soft scrambled egg and spinach toast - all of which were lovely albeit overpriced. It smelled strongly of bacon in the whole place which was both yum and overWhelming. Besides the cost and the heartburn I liked it"
Rose's Cafe,"I am from the Los Angeles area and I was recommended this place. I had the breakfast pizza. It was smoke ham with 2 overmedium eggs. Something different and I have to say very delicious. The dough was crispy and delicious. Will return when in town. Our server was Christine, I think. Lol."
Rose's Cafe,So happy to hear about your experience.  Thank you for sharing!
Rose's Cafe,"Amazing French style breakfast place. The coffee was great. The grilled chicken sausage and polenta with poached eggs was delicious. The polenta was light and creamy and mixed very well with the mild salsa. And to top it off, bread pudding with cinnamon caramelized apples and ice cream was heavenly. Best breakfast I’ve had in a long time. Will be going back soon!"
Rose's Cafe,Ok so we were lucky to get in at closing and really appreciate that as we know what it's like when someone shows up just before closing. They were very friendly and made us feel welcome even tho we know they all wanted to go home. I will say that the one star loss is due to the $5 up charge for arugula on our breakfast pizza. We were asked if we wanted to add it but we're not told there was a charge. $5 for a small handful of greens is a lil much just saying. Oh definitely try the lavender lemonade!
Rose's Cafe,"Thank you for your feedback.  We will reiterate to servers to point that out.  I did just check and all our menus list in the pizza section that additions t have additional fees, and show arugula for $5.  that said we will be more clear that applies as well to the breakfast pizza.  thank you."
Rose's Cafe,"Great brunch spot! The garlic potatoes were a great app -- ketchup was homemade too! Had the smoked salmon breakfast pizza, which was also very good."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for your feedback. So happy to hear about your experience.  Laurie
Rose's Cafe,"Great service. We were seated quickly and had a very nice server who gave us good recommendations. Lattes, pastries, granola, and the chicken sausage with polenta were delicious and satisfying."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for the review.  We are glad you enjoyed your visit! Laurie
Rose's Cafe,My salad and pizza are soooo good. Only a little bit disappointed that the waitress constantly pushing us to pay for the bill without any client waiting there. Kind of annoying. But food is really good.
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Zhou, sorry to hear about feeling rushed. I will talk to the team about this.  Thks for you kind words on the food.  Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"Cute, casual brunch place. Lots to choose from on the menu, which is printed new every day. Tea was great."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for your feedback. Glad to hear of your experience! 
Rose's Cafe,"We ordered a breakfast pizza with ham and eggs. It was not tasty at all. For such a price, they could use Italian prosciutto instead of the cheapest disgusting American ham."
Rose's Cafe,Got some good Italian food in a cozy setting on Union St. Had a very good dinner with the Mrs. the other night at Roses. I’ve never been a big olive guy but the marinated olives were great. The clam pasta was perfectly made and had a lot of flavor. The braised beef was cooked perfectly. I wish I ordered desert but what are you going to do. They have a great wine selection and offer friendly service. Not bad.
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much! Glad you enjoyed it
Rose's Cafe,"The service, food and ambiance are never lacking. Really love their french toast which is different from regular french toast."
Rose's Cafe,"I came in craving a savory brunch, but ended up succumbing to sweetness with no regrets! It was the perfect combo of tender, juicy, caramelized apple on a richly dense French toast bread pudding topped with a delicate, fluffy whipped cream. I absolutely loved the apples and, after devouring everything, I was very excited to get my spoon out to scoop up all the juicy goodness left by the juice of the apples mixing with the melted whipped cream."
Rose's Cafe,The coffee was so good and definitely get arugula on the breakfast pizza! Would go back next time i am in town.
Rose's Cafe,Hi Sammi - thanks so much for the kind words.  Glad to hear about your experience.  Laurie
Rose's Cafe,"I had such a great time at this cafe! I went here with my family and friends before a wedding dress appt. We got brunch - I got the breakfast pizza and garlic potatoes. The lemonade was a little sour so I recommend asking for the simple syrup, then it’s perfect. All the food was great, it was a delicious thin crust. Thank you for supporting a great day."
Rose's Cafe,"hi Rosalie,  we are so glad to hear it!  thanks so much!"
Rose's Cafe,"rude staff. ordered a omelette without spinach, and when it came with spinach and I pointed that out, the waiter got mad and walked away. wasn't very comfortable eating the replacement (which wasn't anything special for 20 dollars either). a misunderstanding can happen, but let's stay polite to each other."
Rose's Cafe,"Hi there,  I'm wondering if you dined at a different Rose's Cafe?  We are in San Francisco and do not offer omelets.  lmk.  thanks, Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"Perfect little spot to have a bite and sit and think. Food is delicious, and plentiful. Waitstaff is consistent, courteous, and kind. Definitely a great place to come. Has a European vibe. The scrambled egg was cooked absolutely perfectly."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much Krista!  appreciate the feedback.
Rose's Cafe,"Classic fare with some sweet china. Loved my asparagus potato soup, I would have ordered it again. Our family went twice while they were in town."
Rose's Cafe,Very well managed brunch place. Made me feel safe dining out(covid safety measures). I liked everything I ordered but I found a bone in the chicken sandwich after which I lost my appetite. Would rate it 5star if not for the bone. The waitress did not change the sandwich or adjust the bill.
Rose's Cafe,"Steelhead trout with fresh veggies was delicious & flavor explosion! My husband loved the burger, and their bread was delicious. We shared a side of cauliflower which we both enjoyed. It was nice to sit outside, and they have heaters. We've always enjoyed our dinners here."
Rose's Cafe,"Thankfully some places remain the same! This neighborhood bistro has always been a spot I fondly think about when visiting the city. The ambiance, service, menu and location are like seeing an old friend."
Rose's Cafe,"Such a lovely place for breakfast, the vibe reminds you of a cafe in Europe. Service was great and the food even better. Highly recommend the sausage and polenta, breakfast pizza and sandwiches. They also have lavender lemonade which is soo good. Their variety of teas is also exceptional."
Rose's Cafe,"On the way down from Steiner street we stopped at this cafe. We just needed coffee and a hot chocolate. The coffee was quite small and the roast was slightly burnt, but not too much that the acridity made the coffee undrinkable. The Hot Chocolate was a warmish chocolate which was a let down on a cold day so could've been much better. The waitress was attentive so service excellent, if the drinks were on par this would've been a 5 star rating,"
Rose's Cafe,"Hii Michael - thanks for the feedback and sorry about the drinks.  We'll reach out to Mr. Espresso, who we get coffee from to check the roast.  Will address the hot chocolate temp too.  Take care, Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"While I was skeptical about their breakfast pizza at first, the instant I saw it, I knew I wouldn't have any issues. The eggs are perfectly cooked in the center with the slices ham constituting the main body of the pizza. Additionally, the size was perfect for one person or could be easily shared between two. The ambiance was also reminiscent of Italian and French sidewalk cafes that I had seen in Rome and Paris. Its location a few blocks off of Lombard st is perfect for a quieter and more intimate experience."
Rose's Cafe,"Do yourself a favor and get the breakfast pizza or the chicken sausage dish! The flavor combinations are amazing! I was not a fan of the cappuccino, it was water down in my opinion. However, would go again any day for the food."
Rose's Cafe,"Kristen is the waitress you want; she has a delightful genuine personality and excellent menu recommendations. This place is not only relaxing in its own charming way, but the flavors of the food transports you to another realm. The music is tasteful and not too loud, which is a rare occurrence in todays food industry."
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Better, Thank you so much for your kind words!  we appreciate your feedback.  Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,Cute cafe. Seemed the breakfast pizza was popular so we ordered that too along with the clam cream pasta. The clam was a but salty but overall delicious. I loved the dish design especially.
Rose's Cafe,"I like the idea behind many of the menu items for this all-day breakfast restaurant.. But their hugely popular salmon pizza deserves a re-examination. The crust has no body at all, it's all crispy (when newly served) and toasty thin crust.  Does not even compare to the satisfaction you get when eating smoked salmon over a piece of cracker. Oh, coffee was terribly bad because it's cold and served in a bowl-like cup. Service was great but servers seem to mind only their own guests."
Rose's Cafe,"hi Benji,  thanks for the feedback. I will address with the team.  Take care, Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,A place with great Italian food and attentive staff.
Rose's Cafe,Thanks Kevin!  We appreciate your feedback and are glad you had a good experience.  Laurie
Rose's Cafe,Rose's Cafe is a nice little place in Cow Hollow. The bread is very good and everything I have ever eaten here has been fresh and well prepared. They have an outdoor patio type seating area that offers a nice relaxed place to eat. Try the spinach and prosciutto.
Rose's Cafe,Serving great comfort food. The atmosphere is totally relax and friendly. It’s like sitting at your mom’s dining table and just enjoy good home cook meal. I love it!
Rose's Cafe,"This is about breakfast. Always passed by this place and wanted to try it finally (usually go to home plate/cracked & battered for breakfast). Not a lot of choices, what we ended up getting didn't taste good, unseasoned, you wouldn't be able to tell the Yukon dish had all the mentioned things in the description for how tasteless it was. Overpriced for what it was. For example the salad one of us got was a handful (probably 5c worth) of spring mix and squeeze of lemon for $13. Server was friendly enough but this is about the breakfast we had that wasn't good at all for nearly $100 with tax and tip. Went to Home Plate afterwards to eat again."
Rose's Cafe,Love this neighborhood cafe. The outdoor seating is straight off a street in Paris. We went with the Breakfast Pizza to try something different it was delicious- like a breakfast sandwich but better! It is a must try.
Rose's Cafe,Murano glass chandeliers clue you in on the Italian origins of this cafe. The polenta is heavenly and even brunch can be turned into a pizza. Dine inside or out. Great place for solo diners.
Rose's Cafe,Place was good enough not my favorite.
Rose's Cafe,Always love this place it’s like old skool SF. Always tasty and great service. If they still have it try the pizza with the egg on top for brunch.
Rose's Cafe,"hi Mitch,  thank you so much for your kind words, we appreciate your business.  Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food. I ordered the Turkey sandwich. I needed to order more mustard as I love the spice it adds but otherwise it was a delicious sandwich. The side salad was delicious and simple. It was a very filling meal. I heard the pizza was great too!"
Rose's Cafe,"The food looks amazing, but this is about what I witnessed when I went in. I wanted a drink and it took forever for someone to help me, but while I was waiting, I noticed someone who all the staff seemed to know. Not sure if she’s a co-owner or a manager but she’s blonde and she stuck her personal water bottle with the rim complete touching to the faucet that all the carafes are filled in. Just unsanitary and during Covid times (yes still) even more mind boggling."
Rose's Cafe,thanks for the feedback.  We will address with the staff. 
Rose's Cafe,"This was a quite lovely place. I personally had the spinach blue cheese salad and the blue cheese was a bit strong but the over all salad I would give it a 9/10. I also tried a pasta, now that was on point! It was delicious. I had my coffee fix and what caught my attention is that they serve small sugar rocks whatever the correct name might be which I’m sure there’s a name for it. I loved that little touch to it, made it very unique for sure. The place was nice and cozy. I was able to enjoy some company, hold a nice conversation and enjoy a really nice meal. Parking was a bit difficult."
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Cari,  thank you so much for your review!  We appreciate it and are happy you enjoyed Rose's.  Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"Service was friendly and quick for takeout.  linguine and clams just the right amount of sauce, but had chili peppers so it was unexpected but I did not read the menu.  My bad. the steelhead was moist and flavorful.  Basic green salads were overpriced.  But that could be a union street thingy. The entrees a bit pricy but it was a special occasion."
Rose's Cafe,"Server didn’t tell me arugula was $5 extra to add to my pizza and when we asked later she said. “Things are expensive around here, that’s just how it is”. Some warning would have been appreciated. Somehow my $25 pizza ended up being $50 when I added a side of fruit as well"
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Chris, sorry you didn’t see it listed on the menu, right under the pizza section for adds. And happy to chk the rest of the bill to make sure there wasn’t any other issue. Always can ask the manager to review your bill."
Rose's Cafe,"Found this place on a food group that I belong to in facebook. I loved it so much, I went with friends three times in 2 weeks."
Rose's Cafe,hi May - thanks so much! That's so amazing to hear!
Rose's Cafe,I ate a lovely quaint brunch here a bit on the early side on Saturday morning. It's a small but delicious menu and the staff was so wonderful and courteous. They made excellent recommendations and brought everything out promptly. The outdoor seating was heated and it was such a peaceful start to the day. Definitely a 5 star rating!
Rose's Cafe,"Rose's has been a Cow Hollow neighborhood institution for years. It can get busy during prime hours or weekends. Try the Salmon Cozy for brunch or one of their breakfast pizzas. Or a simple French omelet, it will tell you how well the kitchen is operated."
Rose's Cafe,"I've enjoyed this cafe ever since I lived in San Francisco about twenty years ago.  Their cafe latte is served in a bowl and is my absolute favorite.  The pizza oven churns out the most delicious breakfast pizza you can imagine - crisp and light.  Seasonings are not heavy, just right.  The food is imaginative, fresh and nutritious. Lavender lemonade is freshly squeezed and delicious.   The staff is always so friendly - Emily, our waitress, was a delight."
Rose's Cafe,"I love this café! I think it's easily one of the better breakfast spots in the city. Can be very busy over the weekend, I try to go during the week when it's much easier to get a table."
Rose's Cafe,"Amazing tea and dessert selection. It was hard to find a place with good dessert options in the city past 6pm and Rose's did not disappoint! Apple crisp, Strawberry shortcake and flourless chocolate cake were so good!"
Rose's Cafe,"Prissy Victorian place ;  as I ate , I listened to a friend drone about her challenges and her children’s lives; I was stuck in a soap opera ; thank God, I remain a bachelor;  the tasty french toast looks like a life-raft carrying soft apple slices into my mouth  ; my friend’s savory dish - potato hash with eggs onions cheddar. has depth ; the service was not warm , it was matter of fact and rushed. This place can serve as a mortuary as well; very mournful atmosphere here."
Rose's Cafe,"Best brunch! I've been going to Rose's for over 20 years. Cappuccino and croissants are a must and have a new dish each time. Dinner is delicious, too!"
Rose's Cafe,The food is always great here and the service is top tier. I highly recommend trying the food out here if you want to try something exciting.
Rose's Cafe,thanks so much for your feedback! we are glad you had a good experience!
Rose's Cafe,"Food is always fresh,  well prepared, and delicious.  All of the folks that work there are happy and friendly.  Grab a sunny sidewalk table!  I highly recommend!!"
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Edwin, thanks so much for your kind words! We are happy you enjoyed your visit.  Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,The food is pretty amazing here and the service is top notch. I highly recommend trying them out when you have a chance.
Rose's Cafe,"I had the assortment of baked goods for breakfast with a cup of tea. First time I've gotten a decent cup of tea in America and the croissant might be the best I've ever had anywhere. The place was very busy, but we didn't feel rushed. A great start to the day."
Rose's Cafe,"hi Pernille,  thanks so much for your kind words!"
Rose's Cafe,"Stopped by for a late Sunday lunch. They have a lot of outdoor seating which was perfect because we brought our dog. I got the turkey sandwich and my friend got the potatoe hash, both of which we enjoyed. The service was slow at times but overall fine."
Rose's Cafe,A European cafe with Italian origins. Had the steelhead and a nice bottle of Chianti which was perfect. Excellent service and ambiance. I’d like to try brunch.
Rose's Cafe,Freaking love the food here and the service is pretty amazing. I highly recommend trying them out when you can.
Rose's Cafe,"Pricey but delicious. The portions are not that big, so don't expect to come out feeling you want to tumble down the hill. There is usually a little wait to get seated.  We tried the salmon pizza and the sausage polenta and both were tasty."
Rose's Cafe,"Great brunch spot on Union with: friendly staff, decent coffee, solid breakfast options with sane portions, tasty looking baked goods, and a curiously strong tea & craft beer game. Quick get table > coffee poured time which is fantastic. Only reason not a 5, is egg and proscuito dish is great but could use maybe some more salt or kick it up with a sauce or something with a stronger bread option. Overall, highly recommend and will definitely be returning!"
Rose's Cafe,"Food is great, latte is over the top sweet. The breakfast hash is great, we come back on the regular for this. The booth couches are a place to avoid, you can literally feel the spring coils ripping through material and assaulting you like you an unwanted city tax. The service is beyond shocking, they rarely clean the tables or chairs, we got there first thing in the morning as they opened and had to wipe down the chairs that had accumulated food from the night before. Wait staff have no time or training to even engage with customers in small chit chat, it's basically a transaction to them and nothing else.  Overall, great food, terrible service, terrible atmosphere. Management need to spend more money on refurbishing and making the place feel like a great corner cafe instead of the run down cash cow that it is."
Rose's Cafe,"I'm sorry to hear of your experience.  Not an excuse but we have been short staff.  Regarding cleaning we have it professionally cleaned nightly, but will work with the team again to ensure things are ready to go when before we open.   Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"1st time there, met up with some former coworkers. Really good food and friendly staff that worked well together. Oh! Bonus was the fleetweek flyovers"
Rose's Cafe,"The food was good, really fresh and tasty calamari."
Rose's Cafe,Cute little café on Union street 🥰 Free coffee refills and good quality brunch. Basic options but cozy environment. Would repeat! …
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for your review!  Glad you enjoyed it.
Rose's Cafe,So good. Great service & good quality brunch dishes. Try the Breakfast pizza!
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for your kind words.  So glad you had a good experience.
Rose's Cafe,"Nice place and seated quickly despite the rain. Food was really good but lattes had no flavor so that was a bummer, maybe try the mocha instead."
Rose's Cafe,"Excellent food and service as always! Today’s mushroom kale soup was just the thing for my cold, and the garlic roasted potatoes... yum."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks Lisa!  that's great to hear. - hope you feel better!
Rose's Cafe,Excellent service. Probably the best place that I've seen where staff are extremely adherent to following and enforcing proper COVID protocol. Very impressive. Menus is QR accessible.  Food was also delicious. Highly recommend the Potato hash with mushrooms and poached eggs.
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much Jamie!
Rose's Cafe,"Loved the breakfast pizza. The girlfriend also thinks the tea was nice, which can be hard in some places apparently. Good spot."
Rose's Cafe,"I loved the spaghetti. I’m a spaghetti bolognese expert, you can count on me. It was so good with the Grenache grape wine that I selected. I will come back hopefully. However why do the service have to be so bad? Is it an American thing? Why so arrogant? Why almost at the edge of being rude? I’m always a nice client to the waiters. Why, why, why?"
Rose's Cafe,"Rose’s was our first meal in San Fran, and this wonderful meal set the bar high for the rest of our stay. Great food, breakfast pizza is to die for. The hash with poached eggs and Bloody Mary also excellent. We dined outside and enjoyed watching the busy morning pass by us as we relaxed and enjoyed an excellent meal."
Rose's Cafe,"The absolute grossest food ever!!! 30$ for some overcooked, salty pasta. Service was awful and somehow people still ate this mediocre food. HARD PASS"
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Ariel, I'm so sorry you had this experience.  Can you tell me what pasta you had and what date?  I'd like to give our chef the feedback.  thank you"
Rose's Cafe,"The place and the food 100% recommended, the coffee really good. But the staff were very rude and they make you believe they're not happy. Sorry for them and the place but I never go back. There are too many nice places around to give breakfast."
Rose's Cafe,Fantastic little cafe. Great homemade pastries and granola. Wonderful ambience. A must if you are in the neighborhood or can make the time.
Rose's Cafe,"Quaint, romantic atmosphere on a quiet side street, away from the hubbub. Service was excellent and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves in that calm, dreamy cafe air."
Rose's Cafe,"Breakfast pizza! Good food, a little pricey, but what isn't in SF? Pretty quick seating too. Gariic potatoes are amazing!"
Rose's Cafe,Food is very good. Nice vibe. They don’t make reservations
Rose's Cafe,Had our first restaurant meal since the start of the pandemic at Rose’s and it was incredible. We sat outside on a perfect day and it felt like we were on vacation.
Rose's Cafe,Thanks Carlos! Great to hear.
Rose's Cafe,Perfect place for breakfast. Salmon pizza so delicious
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much! We are glad you enjoyed it. 
Rose's Cafe,Wonderful weekday afternoon lunch.
Rose's Cafe,Thank you so much - great to hear!
Rose's Cafe,Great food in an awesome SF neighborhood. The breakfast pizzas are the hot items on the brunch/lunch menu.
Rose's Cafe,thanks so much for your feedback!
Rose's Cafe,The best breakfast we had in the neighborhood. The food was so tasty.
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much!
Rose's Cafe,Delicious bakery and very original brunch options. Must try: breakfast pizza.
Rose's Cafe,"Delicious potatoes!! Great service,, good local lunch spot"
Rose's Cafe,The food was decent but I think the price is a little too high. I wouldn't be rushing back but it has a nice diner like atmosphere and a bunch of out door tables. Service was good.
Rose's Cafe,"We didn't find this restaurant to have a strong value.  Drip coffee at $6, the toast was simply underwhelming, polenta simply wasn't terribly interesting. The smoked salmon breakfast pizza was certainly a change, but not enough to set Rose's apart.  This restaurant was a standard product and service for a premium cost. I expect better, frankly, and was somewhat disappointed."
Rose's Cafe,"A neat little neighborhood find that's been serving good food on this corner for nearly 20 years. Not a huge menu, but all the basics are covered wherever it's breakfast, lunch or dinner. Big portions, too."
Rose's Cafe,"Rose's Cafe is a very nice restaurant.  We ordered pizza.  Food was very good and was quick to serve.  The waitress was enjoyable, had a great personality and was very helpful with all our questions about the local area.  We will definitely be back."
Rose's Cafe,It’s ok
Rose's Cafe,I’m glad we stopped in. Food was AMAZING.
Rose's Cafe,"Feels like you’re in Europe when you’re here! The staff has been consistent years before, during, and after the pandemic, so you know they treat their staff well here. The food is excellent. My favorite is the granola: you get a big serving and  they give you a cup of fresh creamy yogurt to drizzle over your seasonal fruit and local granola. The lattes come in bowls which is always a good sign. Just go, you won’t regret it and you’ll want to come back!"
Rose's Cafe,"Sent back the egg ham pizza because the ham was gross.  Ordered the chicken bbq sandwich which was pretty good but not enough so added the polenta with sausage.  The sausage (chicken, not my favorite) was slightly dry.  Polenta was good.  Service was ok - not super genuine."
Rose's Cafe,"We started with a wonderful butter lettuce salad with apples,  pecans and gorgonzola followed by a delicious grilled calamari over lentils. My husband had the braised pork shoulder and asked for it over the garlic potatoes instead of the mashed potatoes. He was very happy. I enjoyed my linguine with clams. It was perfectly delicious. We finished with the strawberry shortcake, the shortcake was warm, soft inside with a nice crispness on the outside and the lemon curd gave it the perfect sweetness. Wonderful dinner!"
Rose's Cafe,"Great food. I got the Breakfast pizza, don't be scared off by the name. It's not acidic at all and is a great start to the morning. Ham is tasty, filling and light, it's big, and the bread is great.  French toast is really sweet, almost like a dessert. Caramelized apples are great on it.  Other stuff we ordered was good, and the freshly squeezed oj was delicious.  Ignore the ""what are you known for"" trolls, this is just a good neighborhood restaurant. Staff is great, they explained what people order on their menu, but as another reviewer said, it's not made for Instagram. It's not the *best* pizza or brunch on the planet, but it's a really good local restaurant for neighbors and visitors alike to stop by."
Rose's Cafe,"Excellent food, service and ambience. The Baked egg, bacon and vegetable dish was delicious"
Rose's Cafe,"Intimate delightful neighborhood Cafe. Really excellent linguini with clams. Perfect place for a warm, cozy discussion with friends over wine and great food."
Rose's Cafe,"Amazing location, cozy place, excellent service, Delicious food and good wine 👌 pet friendly."
Rose's Cafe,You cannot possibly beat the class & linguine at Rose's Cafe.  That joint is fabulous with flavor!
Rose's Cafe,Ordered some red currant rolls/pastry and coffee because I was in the area and needed to kill time. It was so delicious and the coffee is huge I now randomly go all the time because it’s just such a nice place to sit and have a treat. The little tables outside are so great.
Rose's Cafe,Breakfast Pizza is quite good. Definitely do the ham and add an extra egg or 2.
Rose's Cafe,"Had a nice outdoor lunch. Food was delicious, and service was attentive. My turkey sandwich was perfect--whole grain mustard, and avocado on toasted brioche. Polenta was also delicious--served with optional jam."
Rose's Cafe,Came here from for brunch on Easter and food was delicious. I had the Yukon gold hash with scrambled eggs on top I ate the whole plate. They also serve their lattes in an actual bowl as oppose to a cup- I really liked that! Came back for dinner the next night and devoured the Margherita pizza. Server made me a wine suggestion for a white wine from Spain- can't remember the name but it was so good!
Rose's Cafe,"Nice ambiance and a fun place for Sunday brunch, but pretty pricey. We ordered cappuccinos and lattes (very good, but they served the latte in a bowl which was a little tricky to manage), along with the breakfast pizza for $19 (delicious!) and the French toast for $11 (you only get one piece... it's really rich but didn't seem like a good value). If I came back, I'd probably stick to ordering a coffee and their pastries."
Rose's Cafe,Excellent neighborhood cafe. Both the potato hash and the breakfast pizza on the brunch menu were delicious!
Rose's Cafe,hi Daniel - thanks so much!  Laurie
Rose's Cafe,"This is the most outrageously overpriced food I have ever experienced. $8 for 4 plain pieces of bacon. $4 for 2 pieces of bland toast. $23 for a simple, under seasoned “pizza”? If the prices were lower than it would be a DECENT breakfast place. Their idea of raising prices to make it more appealing is silly. It is the most boring food I have ever eaten for prices that would make any human being cringe. Great job confusing me for 30 minutes trying to figure out what you are famous for."
Rose's Cafe,"My favorite breakfast in the city! They do latte bowls which is always a good sign. They also have a very stable staff (lots of familiar faces over the years) so it seems like they are good to their workers here. I like that Rose’s never modernized or conformed to a more “instagramable” restaurant (RIP to the old Home Plate restaurant). It is a quietly beautiful restaurant with amazing food - prosciutto on toast, breakfast pizza, seasonal granola where you pour your own yogurt - Rose’s simply never misses"
Rose's Cafe,"Great service at this cute little Italian joint. The wine menu is decent, but mostly Italian wines. The salad I had was great and super fresh as well as the steak the other party members got. The interior is very cute and bright and it's not a very loud place so it's nice to come on a date or when wanting to catch up."
Rose's Cafe,The best Italian food in all of San Fran is right here. The food is amazing and the service you get is A1. I recommend you try this place out when you get a chance.
Rose's Cafe,"Really enjoyed my breakfast pizza (I mean how could you not love that?!). The only downside was the lack of flexibility in my wife's meal. She ordered the hash and they pre-mix everything so they couldn't leave off the cheese. We totally get it, but it still detracted from the experience. Overall though, really good and our server was great."
Rose's Cafe,"I went in with lower expectations and left pleasantly surprised. Wine list wasn't bad and was reasonably priced. Menu had good options and everything we tried (shared a pizza and short ribs) was very tasty. It's a homely, quaint spot, but overall impressive."
Rose's Cafe,"Awesome little diner in the cow hollow neighborhood. The wait can be a bit much on the weekends, but the food is good and the service is very friendly. The prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to paying at a diner but the food is also higher quality. The nicest part is the outdoor seating which has a nice overhang to provide shade on a sunny day."
Rose's Cafe,"So, so overpriced for what I received- Yukon Gold potatoes with poached was good- ordered side of bacon and toast- bacon was cold and tough and chewy, toast was cold and toasted too hard, unbuttered (?!) and my cappuccino was really a latte, i.e. filled to the rim with milk and no foam. $40 bill. Horrible experience."
Rose's Cafe,"Victor, I'm so sorry to hear about that. If you can tell me when you were in and if you spoke to a manager please then I can followup.  Thank you, Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,Food is good but very rude staff. They also don’t care if their service is good or being nice polite since they have plenty of customers being in a busy location.
Rose's Cafe,"This is one of my favorite places in the Marina for brunch. They have a small menu, but it is packed full of tasty favorites like breakfast pizza and soft scrambled eggs. Many of their dishes can be prepared gluten free and their breakfast cocktails are delish!"
Rose's Cafe,"Quite pricey but worth it. Excellent service, delicious, well-prepared sandwiches. Latte superb."
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much. Unfortunately our food costs and other costs have gone up over 25% this year.
Rose's Cafe,"Great little breakfast and brunch spot. Ever-changing menu of seasonal ingredients married to old classics, and some new ones too. Their staff is super chill and quite efficient when the weather is nice outdoor seating to boot."
Rose's Cafe,"The breakfast pizza here is really quite good -- thin and crispy and savory. The lattes are also generously large, but the macchiatos less so. The soup of the day is expensive ($10 for ""full"" bowl) for what you get, but you won't be disappointed in the flavor."
Rose's Cafe,The food was fine but I did not like the way our waitress treated us. Very very unwelcoming. We had reservations and she told us we couldn't sit on a side where there was very little wind and approximately six Empty Tables. She put us on the side that was so windy it practically blew us away and very uncomfortable. She treated us like we had cooties and I understand reticence around around virus but she took it over the top. When we left and went back around the other side there were still six empty tables that we could have sat at and been sheltered. I won't return
Rose's Cafe,hi Cynthia I'm sorry to hear about your experience.  Will address with staff.  We are all trying to make this outside dining work and I understand its not ideal.
Rose's Cafe,Cute little restaurant with good food and coffee!
Rose's Cafe,What a breakfast ! There is not better
Rose's Cafe,Amazing food! I mean they breakfast pizzas?! Why have I just learned about that now?!
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much for your review. Glad you liked our breakfast pizza!
Rose's Cafe,"Cute little brunch spot at the end of Union with lots of tasty options. I opted for the breakfast pizza and was not disappointed. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I don't think this would ever be my default place to go to for brunch, but it is pretty good if you're in a group that is so inclined to try it out. It has such a cozy atmosphere - you'll forget you're in SF!"
Rose's Cafe,Always the best.  Great people watching. The food has always been very good 👍
Rose's Cafe,"hi Eleanor,  Thanks so much for your review!  We appreciate your business! Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"No callback on food or drinks. Had to flag waitress down for a poached egg that was basically hard boiled. Empty glasses, never offered a second drink throughout service, 10+ min wait for ticket after all plates cleared. No visit from a front of house manager, overhead tables around me with similar complaints. 9/5 brunch."
Rose's Cafe,Absolutely the best Pizza I have ever tasted in my life. I love that they are pet friendly outdoors seating and even gave my little one a biscuit. So worth the wait and you must try the Lavender lemonade!!! Roses cafe you just got yourself a long life customer :-)
Rose's Cafe,Super accommodating. Staff knowledgeable and helpful- bussers and servers.  I lived in the city years ago and regret never eating there.  It was a great experience.
Rose's Cafe,Me and the Mrs got two cokes here in the way to our pilgrimage to Mrs Doubtfires House. The waitress was polite and ambiance of the place was very nice.
Rose's Cafe,"Love this longtime establishment! Unlike almost every other restaurant on Union, Rose’s has stayed true to its tradition and isn’t wildly overpriced. Portions are very good size and I really like the cozy environment.  The clams linguine is to die for!"
Rose's Cafe,"This place used to be good. I’ve now had multiple orders where all my food tasted like burned oil... fish, vegetables, potatoes. It’s a shame, because I know they have quality food. It’s the chef doesn’t know what their doing with oil temperatures. The food is basically toxic."
Rose's Cafe,"Great brunch spot. Service is attentive, the host was really nice and manages the crowds well. We had a pizza outside with a glass of wine and enjoyed ourselves."
Rose's Cafe,"Went to Rose's Cafe with my sister and her boyfriend. It was rather quiet for a weekend brunch time, as I'm used to 1-2hour plus waits for a table at brunch. My sister and I got the strawberry french toast and breakfast pizza to share. The portions are pretty big, so sharing is great if you want to try different things.  The breakfast pizza was delicious, served with runny eggs and ham on top. I love runny eggs. There wasn't enough pizza to go around, it was devoured. Onto the French Toast, which wasn't my favorite. I've eaten A LOT of french toast in my days and this is not one of the top ones. Rose's french toast is very, very sweet and the strawberries almost had an artificial taste to it. Kind of like the way artificial strawberry candy or popsicles taste.  Overall, a solid 3 stars for no wait and delicious breakfast pizza."
Rose's Cafe,It's been Years since I've been back and the great news is nothing has changed but what's even better nothing has changed and it is still on of my favorite brunch spots in SF AND a favorite of mine anywhere. Get the breakfast pizza!!
Rose's Cafe,We’ve had numerous good meals here the past 20 years but this wasn’t one of those. Times have changed.
Rose's Cafe,Had breakfast here and was excellent. Great menu choices and service was awesome. Easy to walk to from where we were staying as well.
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much! Glad you enjoyed it!
Rose's Cafe,"Had brunch here and loved it. The atmosphere feels like a vintage cafe. Service was accommodating to our requests. Food was tasty, especially the homemade bread which was divine."
Rose's Cafe,I ordered a granola with fruits and yogurt. On the bill they charged it separately which is unfair. The juice was in a small cap and costs 6 dollars. Overcharged and not so friendly.
Rose's Cafe,Rose's cafe is delightful and the food is very comforting. The staff is also extremely friendly both to the guests and their dogs. Mine loves the house made dog treats.
Rose's Cafe,"Really nice ambiance in this place. My girlfriend and I got a seafood pasta dish to split which was great. The restaurant had a feeling like an old Italian place (which it is), but the character is still very much there. It was a wonderful spot for a quick and not too pricey date night"
Rose's Cafe,"Thanks Brian, we appreciate your feedback!"
Rose's Cafe,"I used to go to Rose's for brunch years ago. In the old days they had a postcard with Felinghetti's ""one fine day"" printed on it. I loved it. I went there with friend recently for brunch. Heavy dose of nostalgia. No postcards but the food, ambiance, and service are still up there. Good coffee. Their signature scrambled egg pizzas are unique, delish, and great values. The veggie hash was also yummy."
Rose's Cafe,"Good, not great. A little pricy for what the food was and the service wasn't anything special. It's a decent option for brunch and the breakfast pizza is tasty, but don't expect to have anything necessarily better than any other brunch."
Rose's Cafe,"Completely charmed with Rose's cafe. First, there is the amiable and attentive staff (asking our table if we needed anything & greeting our table as we came in and out the resturant) The resturant has outdoor seating with enough room to give the feel of a private meal but enough view of the city. On top of that, there was optional out door heating, which is soo nice! Then the menu had a good variety of options to eat. The bread pudding with strawberries tasted fantastic. My waitress was on point. She always refilled my coffee. In the end, my ticket was affordable and worth every bit. Roses Cafe is adorably put together. I'll be coming back with friends and family, for sure."
Rose's Cafe,"We came for brunch. Very disappointing. We made it clear we had an allergy to ham/pork. However, both dishes were served with EXTRA ham...even though the menu stated the dish did not come with it. We were told the dishes have recently changed from what was on the current menu and they could not accommodate our pork allergy......"
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Paige, I'm sorry for your experience.  I spoke with the manager on duty and he said that the server did make a mistake and you got a dish with ham.  He told me that we replaced it with a dish without ham. Please note that we do change our menus daily, so sometimes there is a mistake like this.  I'm sorry you didn't have a better experience.  Laurie"
Rose's Cafe,"I thought Rose's was a great place for a business meeting. The staff was friendly and good on the coffee, the food was good (even the french toast bread pudding wasn't too heavy and had lots of yummy apple slices), and the ambience wasn't silent but definitely not too loud."
Rose's Cafe,"Went for SF Restaurant Week. Had a shrimp quiche topped with an arugula salad, followed  by a salmon filet atop a crushed chickpea patty. Shrimp and fish fresh and delish. Dessert was a lava cake topped with house made ice cream. Decadent and sweet sweet sweet....  The people are the standouts here with very friendly, prompt and helpful service. Lot's of local regulars eating here."
Rose's Cafe,"Lovely atmosphere and setting. They serve coffee in bowls, as is often done in France. My latte was very nice. The pastries are freshly made and pretty decent. I'll happily come back."
Rose's Cafe,Great breakfast pizza and reasonable coffee.
Rose's Cafe,This is definitely a neighborhood favorite. They have everything from really great pizza to full dinners and some very healthy choices too. If you have a really picky person in your group go here and everyone will be happy.
Rose's Cafe,Visiting from Sacramento and was looking for place that was dog friendly. Rose's Cafe filled the bill. Food was very good and service was great. Even treated our dog to a special house biscuit and bowl of water.  Will be back next time we are in the City.
Rose's Cafe,"Rose's Cafe is a very good pick for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  There are a few seats outside and there are heaters to turn on if it's a bit cold (though, Cow Hollow usually has nice weather).  The inside has comfortable booths and tables.  As far as the food goes, I tried the Roasted Turkey Breast sandwich and  I'm glad I did."
Rose's Cafe,"Great service and food.  A true neighborhood gem!  Love the outdoor dinning, Rose's has done a fabulous job of managing all outdoor dining, well spaces and thoughtful table placement."
Rose's Cafe,Hi Naja - thanks so much for the feedback!
Rose's Cafe,"Great food, nice staff, and good atmosphere. There wine is way over priced though. Spent  $50 on a $10 bottle of wine. You're better off bringing your own bottle and paying the corking fee."
Rose's Cafe,"The half chicken is absolutely the best!!  Tender, juicy, almost melts in your mouth!  Walking in one night, I held the door open for a couple walking out.  But they insisted that my group come in from the cold first.  As we scurried in, the woman looked vaguely familiar.  As we sat down, someone in our party said that was Nancy Pelosi!!  Missed an opportunity to thank her for her service!"
Rose's Cafe,"Very good service and perfect food! Nice atmosphere, and Justine maked us feel very comfortable. Thanks a lot for a nice evening in San Francisco, the last one before we're heading back to Norway :)"
Rose's Cafe,"It was ok, 3.5 stars but had to round down not up. Enjoyed our food, good service, outdoor space but can't believe it's one of the top 15 brunch place in SF. We got the breakfast (ham) pizza and hash. Nothing spectacular like some of the reviews are saying"
Rose's Cafe,"Took the mom here for mother's day and I think she's come back here at least four times since then (all the way from the east bay).  I have to give five stars, because this place makes, without a doubt, the greatest waffle I've ever had in my life.  Even though the waffle is just one little square, it's covered with so much good stuff you will barely even recognize that it's a waffle deep down inside.  Great brunch spot to go stroll around the unique cow hollow shops afterwards."
Rose's Cafe,"Found this place on Google maps and almost didn't go in because the outside isn't very fancy . Neither is the inside,  but it is definitely cozy and welcoming. And gosh (!) the food is good, the people are warmly welcoming and the atmosphere is like an old fashioned diner in the best sense. Definitely recommended."
Rose's Cafe,Great corner spot that's towards the end of the Union Street strip. Cozy atmosphere with some excellent outdoor seating available. Coffee is above average and the food is as well. A bit on the pricey side but it's a great brunch spot.
Rose's Cafe,"Different food than I am used to, but tasty enough. Was chilly sitting outside, so may have cooled food too quickly. Service was good, atmosphere is lovely."
Rose's Cafe,"Delicious food, beautiful ambiance, great staff"
Rose's Cafe,Side walk seating so like The Italy. The service was great coffee authentic and friendly.
Rose's Cafe,thanks so much!  so glad you enjoyed it!
Rose's Cafe,"I went here for meeting a friend, I ordered the beat salad  but was ok. She and omelet and was super salty. Is really hard to find parking on the area. Also for the location I think that is overprice."
Rose's Cafe,Rose's is a nice little neighborhood gem in Cow Hollow.  I like Rose's for brunch on the weekends with well made Bloody Mary's and mimosas.  The brunch menu has a great breakfast pizza as well as several good combinations.  Sit outside on the sidewalk if you can.
Rose's Cafe,I was waiting for an appointment nearby and needed a bite to eat. Rose’s is super cute and has a delicious egg sandwich and focaccia. Will definitely stop by again.
Rose's Cafe,"I've eaten here a few times mostly due to there extremely high prices, But you pay for the charm."
Rose's Cafe,The service was good. But the food was disgusting. I’m sorry but it was really nasty eggs and even the toast was burnt! Like who serves burnt toast ? It’s basically a bougie menu with tiny portions and no taste. I wish I could have a refund!! So sad ):
Rose's Cafe,"This is one of my favorites in the marina, the breakfast pizza and breakfast sandwiches are awesome! They have a nice selection of mimosas to choose from. They also have some outdoor seating as well which is worth waiting for."
Rose's Cafe,Absolutely loved the cafe. Food is excellent. Great pastries. Coffee is good. Atmosphere is spot on. Seating is comfortable. Make this your new weekend brunch hangout!
Rose's Cafe,"Great food, Chicken sausage was fantastic!"
Rose's Cafe,"The food was great , we enjoyed it ❤"
Rose's Cafe,"This place was amazing! Best non-traditional French toast I've ever had. Breakfast pizza was good too. Perfect place to brunch at, just get there early."
Rose's Cafe,Had a good meal here with some great people. Thin crust pizza was excellent and the bruschetta and apple crisp dessert were also tasty. Would come again.
Rose's Cafe,"Good food and great service. Very cute seating outside - especially handy during COVID times.  Things to try: breakfast pizza, turkey sandwich, French toast, any pizza for dinner."
Rose's Cafe,thanks!  appreciate your business
Rose's Cafe,"Tucked away behind some cute hedges, Rose's Cafe offers a nice hideout in the middle of a vibrant city. It boasts an interesting menu which ultimately is a matter of personal preference. My recommendation would be to avoid the breakfast pizzas and get the delicious Yukon Golden Hash. Watch for the sneaky rocket/arugala add on which comes at a hefty cost."
Rose's Cafe,"Honestly...great soup, awesome sandwiches and the bread is to die for, scratch made in house.  The manger is an absolute riot and we will return every time we are in the neighborhood - truly exceptional sidewalk lunch!"
Rose's Cafe,Flavorful zucchini soft scrambled eggs
Rose's Cafe,This place is quaint and hidden nearby off Union St. The staff was very friendly and made a few great recommendations for my friends. We came here during brunch on a Sunday afternoon and was seated immediately outside at the patio. Service was fast and I would come back again!
Rose's Cafe,One of San Francisco's gems! My vanilla latte comes in a gigantic mug. Breakfast pizza is delicious! I love your food and friendly service. Thank you 🙌🏼✨ …
Rose's Cafe,"I'm not as impressed by this place as I used to be: it's been a few years and I clearly recall both the service and the food being distinctly better. Maybe it's because we were came on  weekday -- perhaps the ""A"" team works the weekends. I've had a good experience with other breakfast places on Union or Chestnut"
Rose's Cafe,"A true neighborhood gem, this corner cafe with sidewalk seating is a sweet spot at the west end of Union Street's commercial strip. Delicious menu items, friendly staff and sunny, comfortable table spaces."
Rose's Cafe,"Rose's cafe is so cute! I've only been for breakfast, but the food was really good. I've walked by at night, and the outdoor patio is lit with Christmas lights and seems really relaxing. I'll definitely go back."
Rose's Cafe,Very polite service and the cpffee was fine.  Recommended to me by the dentist office down the block.  Pricey for a small cup of coffee but it was good.
Rose's Cafe,hi Michael - thanks for your feedback.  Laurie
Rose's Cafe,"We really enjoyed the place and had a wonderful time, the food  and wine was great, our server did a good job as well."
Rose's Cafe,Quaint Italian Cafe. I felt like an expat  in Italy during the roaring twenties. I absolutely loved the vibe. The menu is simple but flavorful and the wine selections were on point. Great service and a friendly staff.
Rose's Cafe,Favorite place in the Marina for a hangover cure. Efficient friendly staff. BOMB breakfast pizza. Delicious side potatoes with great flavors. Lovely seating outside.
Rose's Cafe,Service was awesome. Desserts were ok. I wanted to use their wifi while I enjoy my dessert but it was unacceptably slow.
Rose's Cafe,"Excellent food and better service. Waiter was super friendly and attentive. Food was all hot, fresh, and tasty. Recommend the bruschetta."
Rose's Cafe,Hi Vinay - thanks so much & really appreciate the comments!
Rose's Cafe,Very nice staff. The food just seems a bit overhyped and fairly disappointing given the price point.
Rose's Cafe,"This is one of my favorite places to go for brunch. Recommend any of their breakfast pizzas and the sausage with polenta. (But really, everything I've ordered here has been tasty.)"
Rose's Cafe,Just the best food in Union St. Cozy place for a private meal.
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Tom,  thanks so much for your review and kind words.  We appreciate it!"
Rose's Cafe,"Amazing! Actually traditional food, fresh squeezed juice and fresh made bread! Friendly service and table seating spread out to feel safe while dining"
Rose's Cafe,"Hit chocolate was amazing, but way too large.  We should have shared it between 2. No vegan offerings really at all.  Service was okay, spotty but we came in 30 minutes before the end of shifts."
Rose's Cafe,"The chicken tarragon sausage, poached eggs and polenta breakfast was the perfect way to start a Monday. They were even nice enough to do their ""green eggs & ham"" which was no longer on their menu."
Rose's Cafe,Lovely breakfast polenta.  Cute and cozy cafe with a selection of casual Italian inspired fare.  Not a bad place to have a meal and pass the time on on a lazy morning.
Rose's Cafe,In the heart ❤️ of Pacific Heights enjoyed my meal outside. Fresh ingredients daily. Mm mm good!
Rose's Cafe,The Breakfast Pizza is wonderful. Service is usually a challenge as the place is always full! The Burger with fried potatoes is one of the best I have ever tasted.
Rose's Cafe,get the breakfast pizza with truffle oil. we do everytime. without truffle oil it's good. but with it's the best. fruit focaccia is also really good. fresh squeezed oj can't go wrong. good place not too crowded on the weekends.
Rose's Cafe,"Superb dinner, great service, and around $30 for an entree. Get their bread with olive oil."
Rose's Cafe,"The food is outstanding, ambiance is also great. Location is beautiful!"
Rose's Cafe,Pizza Margerhita 10/10 ! Tastes like in Italy. Everything was delicious
Rose's Cafe,So nice to hear that! thanks so much!
Rose's Cafe,Nice hip place for breakfast. Can get busy and the service can be inflexible. Food was decent but nothing more when we were there.
Rose's Cafe,Delicious brunch and nice location.
Rose's Cafe,what a gouge! $75 for breakfast  Bacon eggs toast and juice and it was NOT that good not for $75 NOT recommend at all it Smells kind of funky in the restaurant And the service one star 👎👎👎👎👎 Do you self a favor go somewhere else and save you money
Rose's Cafe,Nice outdoor dining with heaters. Takes reservations. Well prepared Italian comfort food.
Rose's Cafe,Whenever I see french toast on the menu I have to order... just one of those Sara quirks. I've tried about every french toast in San Francisco and I have to say that Roes's is still my favorite. Smothered in whipcream and strawberries it's definitely an indulgence not to be missed ;)
Rose's Cafe,"Jesse the manager, and Shane our server were terrific! Food was outstanding! Pizza with prosciutto and arugula! Iced tea was excellent!"
Rose's Cafe,"Definitely one of my favourite cafés in SF. Nice outdoor seating, a magnificent breakfast pizza (don't miss it!) and huge cafe latte's served in soup bowls!"
Rose's Cafe,"This is known as the spot where techies and VCs hang out at outside of SOMA. All home cooked, comfort feeling food that is somewhat healthy. I have never had brunch here because there's always a line around the block."
Rose's Cafe,Breakfast pizza and garlic potatoes were delicious! More than enough to share between 2 people.
Rose's Cafe,"The cappellini was delicious, service was excellent"
Rose's Cafe,"Rose's always has the best soups, but had the best cheesecake outside of Italy here - vanilla bean with chocolate sauce."
Rose's Cafe,"Lovely place to have breakfast. Well presented, fresh food. Very tasty and pleasant atmosphere."
Rose's Cafe,"Lovely soft scrambled eggs with leek, however very small portion for the price. Staff very pleasant and good service."
Rose's Cafe,Amazing. Taste it.
Rose's Cafe,Thank you!
Rose's Cafe,Incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. The muffins are out of this world and the French toast is soooo rich and decadent!
Rose's Cafe,thanks Rachel!  So happy to hear! Laurie
Rose's Cafe,Food was delicious and our waiter was nice. Dog friendly place I would come back.
Rose's Cafe,"We think we ate hear.  Hard to tell.  We're still hungry!  The food was very good.  But, where's the rest of it?  Does the cook take his cut or something?"
Rose's Cafe,Order Peperoni and calabrian chilies pizza.
Rose's Cafe,One of my favorite places to have brunch or lunch or dinner!! Consistently delicious with great service!!
Rose's Cafe,The food was good. The atmosphere was quaint for a cafe. Rose's has been around for many years and is a favorite of my aunt's.
Rose's Cafe,"OMG.....one of THE best Margherita pizzas I have ever had.    Great, fast service too.   Will return"
Rose's Cafe,Thanks so much John.  We are happy to hear that!
Rose's Cafe,"Great place,very friendly people,and really good service,ask for server( Lindsay)and i ill recommend it number one serving. Thank you everyone for the good food."
Rose's Cafe,Over priced and food was bland. Surprised about the food quality when there is so much competition in the restaurant space in SF. Recommend brunch somewhere else.
Rose's Cafe,"Hi Bennett, sorry you had a bad experience. Can you tell me what you ordered so we can address it? Thk you"
Rose's Cafe,"Stalwart in Cow Hollow.  Lunch or dinner.  Classic selection of food, plus pizza and pasta.  For beer drinkers there's a great chance you'll find Pliny the Elder :)"
Rose's Cafe,"Lovely for brunching with your girlfriends, this place has a few tables outside that are absolutely necessary on a rare warm SF day. Service is rather slow, but food delish."
Rose's Cafe,"Great food! , The only thing I wish is they had a bit more to offer in breakfast choices."
Rose's Cafe,Rose's Cafe is a quitensential place to be for Sunday brunch.  The pastries and bread are freshly baked on a daily basis. Breakfast pizzas are the breakfast of champions@
Rose's Cafe,Parisian-inspired cafe in the Marina. Great food--espcially brunch. Can be difficult to get a table on the weekends.
Rose's Cafe,"Outstanding service and welcoming atmosphere. Good portions and original, healthy  dishes."
Rose's Cafe,"Overpriced even for SF. Tiny portions and, frankly, pompous atmosphere. The food was fine but I wished I had saved my money."
Rose's Cafe,The service was very kind and the food delicious. I could feel many customers were regular.
Rose's Cafe,What a delightful little cafe. A local that I met on the street recommended it to me and it was buzzing inside. The staff were delightful and the food and coffee arrived quickly. Bliss!
Rose's Cafe,Moka coffee and Orange bun: awesome

Rose's Cafe,"It doesn't seem cheap, but everything in San Francisco is much more expensive by our standards (for example, a police officer earns double there). Excellent spaghetti with peppers eaten. A locally brewed beer is served that has an excellent taste, fresh, clear, not sweet but still with a distinct character. (Even better than a Duvel) The bus stops diagonally opposite. Public transport is well organized."
