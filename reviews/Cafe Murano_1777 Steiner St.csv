Cafe Murano,The woman who works here is so sweet. I got the breakfast bagel and it had a soufflé egg in it. It was sooooo good!!! Also very filling. My bf got a coffee and it was the perfect temperature to drink right away.
Cafe Murano,"Line too long at sweet maple? GO HERE. This cute, unassuming cafe has such good breakfast options for very reasonable prices. Get the lox bagel or breakfast bagel and you won’t be disappointed."
Cafe Murano,Had a great experience here! My latte was delicious 🤤 really sweet people here. Cozy little spot. It’s quiet. …
Cafe Murano,"Good cafe that is independently run. Independent means that your mileage may vary in terms of quality, but we had a good experience nonetheless. We were here first thing in the morning and got a chance to try the breakfast bagel, which was good though a bit expensive. They're preparation of the coffee drinks were good, not excellent though."
Cafe Murano,Imperceptible amount of hummus on my bagel. Asked twice for lettuce and she nodded but alas.  Coffee was fine.
Cafe Murano,Great little cafe perfect for getting some work done. Unpretentious and chill. Yummy muffins. ☕
Cafe Murano,"Sandwich, coffee, background music , wifi was ok, not crowded at all , there were just two people inside, and it would be perfect place to work on my computer but really this Cafe closes at 2 pm, not 5pm. I got there around 1 pm and it was kind of frustrating. Please, pay attention!"
Cafe Murano,"Came here to study for my series exams; it's a quiet cafe with a nice relaxed scene. I ordered a house coffee which was dark roast, and had a breakfast sandwich. The egg was steamed rather nicely. Among other amenities, there is WiFi and desks for work (and outlets!) which was really helpful but beware of ""winter hours"" which start in October. The cafe closes at 3:30pm instead of 5pm on Sundays."
Cafe Murano,"It's a nice place, but nothing really special. I had the 3 way avocado toast and it was ok."
Cafe Murano,"I stopped here for a quick breakfast. The interior was a bit dirty and unappealing, but the breakfast amazed me:  I ordered their oatmeal with fruit, and it was the best oatmeal I'd had in a long time. The servers were really fast and nice as well. Will definitely stop here again when I am in the neighborhood."
Cafe Murano,"Someone was DEFINETELY microdosing when they took my order, but overall, a pleasant experience with a decent atmosphere."
Cafe Murano,"Came by here after lunch for a quick coffee ... the dark roast was good -- fresh, flavorful, and just what I was after.  Two club chairs and one chewed up vinyl sofa, otherwise not too inviting.  Be sure to note winter hours, as they close at 3:30 every day."
Cafe Murano,"The interior is cute, and the shop is situated in a nice area of town, but that doesn't make this little cafe a good coffee shop. The customer service was sub par (it seemed like a chore to take my order), they couldn't tell me what coffee roaster they use, they put a double in my 16 ounce americano when I asked for a triple (the shots themselves were weak too) which made the coffee thin, and they had a very tinny sounding stereo blasting 90's female singer songwriter hits that made it very hard to concentrate on the book I was reading.  Cafe Murano may have a hip aesthetic, but if you're looking for good coffee, I would recommend going somewhere else."
Cafe Murano,"nice coffee, full flavoured, fresh beans.  Very clean, tables. Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed.  Great place to rejuvenate and get caffeinated up!  edit: im back in San Francisco 4 months after my last visit, and i still love this place :)  it feels 'local' comfortable and welcoming."
Cafe Murano,"Great little coffee shop. Good coffee, service, and atmosphere, along with decent seating. Most people in the shop are working on their laptops, so finding seating can be a hit or a miss depending on the time you go."
Cafe Murano,"Cafe Murano seems to be a well kept secret of a cafe. It's a quiet place to study, work on your laptop, or read a book. There's free wifi. Seating is soft and comfortable. Coffee is good, and the food is generally fresh and tasty. Everything is reasonably priced. And the staff is sweet. Overall, Cafe Murano is a good cafe to enjoy some quiet in the middle of lower Pacific Heights."
Cafe Murano,Just moved to the area and this is already becoming a favorite neighborhood spot for when I need to work or read. It's cozy and has a nice ambiance. I always enjoy the background music and the staff is friendly. Food is pretty good and I really like their chai mocha. And the wifi is a huge plus- I've found free wifi can be hard to come by in SF! Don't have anything negative to say about this place.
Cafe Murano,"Seems like a quiet spot to work on your laptop and enjoy a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, my mocha tasted a little thin and maybe a little burnt, too; but it was a good spot to go while waiting for a seat at Sweet Maple which is next door. There's a little outdoor seating at this cafe, a Pac Man machine and from the look of it a diverse selection of pastries. I didn't partake, but I imagine this is a good spot in the neighborhood to get some privacy while enjoying the Wifi."
Cafe Murano,"Great little retro Euro cafe on Steiner. The coffee is tasty, but it's the sandwiches keep bringing me back. My go to sandwich selection is the Rolo, which features delicious grilled chicken topped with oodles of fresh mozzarella and sundried tomatoes.  That paired with a tea, coffee, or soda makes for a great place to visit on a sunny afternoon."
Cafe Murano,"Ok, this place has everything that a coffee shop should have, and if you knowcoffee shops, you'll be pleased. But.... they have one thing most coffee shops DON'T have, and that, my friends, is a cocktail style fast Ms. Pac Man machine. And that makes a big difference to me. Come for the caffiene, stay for the ghosts. Cafe Murano. Also we found it's a great place to get a coffee if you are waiting for closer brunch places, but also I'd like to just try this place for a breakfast sandwich. Other people seem to like it. Just sayin'"
Cafe Murano,Good place to grab a latte it a quick cup of coffee. It's a fairly unassuming place. Not a lot of seating available if you want to lounge around for awhile.
Cafe Murano,"Stopped by here for a latte, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. The barista knew what she was doing and poured a very good cup of coffee. If you are in the neighbourhood and in need of a pick me up then stop by."
