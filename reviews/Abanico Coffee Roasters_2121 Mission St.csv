Abanico Coffee Roasters,"this is the café of my dreams. natural light, open seating, chill latin music, great drinks. their specialty drinks are latin-inspired, and the back wall had a cute mini mart of local artist ware like ceramics and drinking chocolate. they have wifi but only one outlet; great to get some work done if you charge up beforehand. there are pastries from Starter and Sweet Condesa available, and the staff are really sweet + conversational.  i got the latte con coco y choco ($6.50) with oat milk (+$1). it makes me really sad to pay extra for plant milk but :’) sok im glad they have options. i’ll definitely come back!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Little slice of heaven in the mission district! 4.5 stars. LOVED the menu, so many flavors from home not offered at most places. We had the iced café de olla, cortado, and the morro latte —- all delicious! Customer service was also exceptional. Atmosphere is super cute and aesthetic."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"A wonderful coffee place!  Tried their cappuccino and a special drink. Loved them both. Their coffee has good texture and balance. Special drinks are Latin-inspired, blends with the Mission neighborhood.  Interiors are vibrant and spacious. Baristas are friendly. They only have indoor seating.  Disclaimer: Be vigilant of the neighborhood  Definitely a great place to grab coffee"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Large space to sit and sip coffee. Lots of Latin American inspired latte creations on the menu that I have to try in the future.  I did not see any outlets however, so may be difficult to do work with a laptop, but there is wifi. Coffee was nice, would come back to journal or sketch and have quiet time."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"I don't know why it took me so long to find this place. From all the places that I've tried around SF, Abanico has been the only place that have a sweet and creamy kind of espresso. It's all about the care in the process: they roast their own beans from Mexico and Guatemala, good equipment and professional baristas. Also, I just normally drink my coffee without sugar, but I'm totally down to try their signature drinks that I think are original."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Abanico Coffee Roasters serves remarkable coffee and espresso drinks with appetizing Latin inspired flavors.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,I had a great experience here. Had the morning off so was walking around the neighborhood and I’ve been meaning to stop into this place. It was a great place to do the daily crossword puzzle. I enjoyed the music. They also have some local artists works up. I really like the open space. Had a cortado but I’m also interested in trying their specialty drinks.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much Elaine. So glad you enjoyed your time and coffee! See you soon.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,A hidden gem in the mission. Tried their specialty espresso drinks a few times and was wonderfully balanced in flavor. The barista was kind to answer questions. Spacious but not a lot of seating. Very clean for a business located in this neighborhood. Thinking of trying their coffee beans someday.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Abanico has a super clean and open space to sip on their Salvadorean inspired drinks and pastries. I love the homage to Central American countries and the dedication to their unique space.  I had a espresso which was tasty, true to origin, and served with sparkling water. I wish they offered pour overs, I’d be here every day!  No outlets so bring a charged device like others recommend."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"This beautiful Salvi owned coffee shop features Central American roasts and specially crafted drinks with traditional flavors.  My favorite drink is the Cafe con Morro latte, which is made with Morro seeds - the same used to make horchata Salvadoreña.  On a warm Mission day you must have an iced cafe de olla. Slightly sweet and cinnamony.  If you just need a quick pick me up, get a cafecito Cubano for that late morning slump.  Even in the fall they had a central American twist on the ever popular pumpkin spice latte, which was made with traditional ingredients and topped with pepitas.  Ana, the owner, is super sweet and radiates a love for artisanal  coffee while honoring culture and cultivating a community environment.  You can also find pastry pop-ups on some lucky days! Whack Donuts frequents on Fridays and Quesseso Quesadillas has also made an appearance."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much María José for your detailed and thoughtful review. We are so happy that you enjoy the coffee and the experience! Stay tuned for those pop ups!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,This place has become my favorite spot. The guava scones is really good.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Open and spacious. Good for a quick coffee and a snack. Didn’t see any power outlets so bring a full battery.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"We really enjoyed coming to this coffee shop.  Every time we come in here, I always like to try something different.  So far, my favorite drink is the Cafe con Morro.  The staff are friendly and the space is nice and clean.  We also like their coffee beans.  Our favorite is the beans from Honduras.  We can't wait for them to bring them back."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,It opened about 7 months ago! Tried a cappuccino and cortado coquito (sesonal) - the drinks were amazing and well balanced (not overly sweet). Lot of space to sit and inside. Must try!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thanks so much for stopping in!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"The freshest new Mission coffee shop. POC, women owned. The space is super clean and open and I’m excited for them to get a Shared Spaces parklet. Ana made some time to chat, which was really appreciated! My cafe con coco y choco was great - can’t go wrong with condensed coconut milk. It was rich and creamy, but not too sweet.  Soy, almond and oat milk choices available as well. No decaf yet, so I went full caffeine!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Emily! Thank you so much for stopping in. It was very nice chatting with you and meeting new neighbors. See you soon.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"The coffee and espresso drinks are some of the best in the city. Service and atmosphere are fantastic. Check this cafe out, it will not disappoint."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Delightful environment, tasty unique pastries, and delicious inventive coffee drinks. The Cafe con leche is amazing!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Love  love love love Abanico Coffee Roasters. My go to is cafe con leche, iced or hot it always hit the spot. I travel just to get my morning coffee and it’s well worth it. Can’t wait for more locations to come. The Owner is very sweet and passionate and so is the rest of the team."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you for your sweet and thoughtful review!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,10 stars. The cold cafe de hoya with a splash of milk was perfect. We came here to watch the carnaval parade and everyone was really nice and accommodating. Stop by here to try a cold brew. You won’t be disappointed.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Maybe my favorite coffee in the city. Unique flavor combos, love it 10/10 recommend"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,It’s a really cute spot with great service and nicely pulled cortado. I appreciate the Wi-Fi and was able to get some work done.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,This place is nice with it's minimalist look and open layout. The mocha latte is delicious and the bacon cheese scones are delightful. Ask them to heat it up you'll thank me.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Came to support cause ya know it’s a new Salvadorian coffee joint( I’m salvi soooo) and was disappointed. Really want to like this place but it was not good. My sister and I ordered two different coffee’s off the menu. We tried each other’s drinks and they both tasted the same. Lol huh? Plus the baristas were WHITE!! Like fr? I was expecting Latinos working here, no wonder my drink tasted so bad. Support other Latino own coffee shops cause I don’t think this place is."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"I got the cafe con coco and the cafe con morro- both were delicious! The drinks were well balanced (just sweet enough, the right amount of spices, coffee not too acidic or smooth). I really enjoyed the fact the options incorporated traditional ingredients and seasonal options.  Please come visit this coffee shop next time you’re in the Mission!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"This place was super clean and much open space.. the m9cha was a little steep,  but it tasted delicious and was ready very quick.. I even loved the presentation.. will be returning"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thanks again for your support.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,House coffee was delicious. Very different from other coffees I’ve tried. I believe it’s from El Salvador. Well worth the $3.50. One size only (12oz) on all their drinks.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much for stopping in! See you next time.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,There's something special about this place. They have the general selection of lattes and coffees if that's what you're looking for but I highly recommend trying one of their specialty drinks. My friend and I tried the cafe con morro and the iced cafe de olla. Very different from what I've tried before! The flavors are complementary and add a special touch to your morning. The staff is very knowledgeable about each of the coffees so if you're confused just ask! The cafe de olla has a mildly sweet nutty molasses flavor. While the cafe con morro has a lively savory yet creamy taste.  Will be back!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you for your thoughtful review Nini. See you soon!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Not busy, open and spacious, music is a tad loud if your on a work call. Enjoyed a safe haven from a long mission walk."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Great coffee shop. Got the Pinolillo which was a cacao and corn latte. It was delicious.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Lovely signature drinks paired with a tasty assortment of pastries. Great vibes in the space overall.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Was there 2 weeks ago, pretty decent place for the neighborhood but don't expect anything special. No rotational coffee beans ( but who wants them anyway) and restrooms are closed for the public ( no surprise here as well). Baristas is really nice and will do their best to answer all your questions ( in my case they did). I tried one of three offered pastries scone with a dill, interesting combination buy I would add bacon."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"An amazing cafe with a really cool selection of uniquely crafted coffee drinks. The owner and team working there make the place a very warm and inviting experience!  The cafe is super clean, well decorated, and brings a lot of tradition and culture to the area and community… Definitely a must try and totally look forward to trying all the different styles of drinks and taking in that awesome coffee aroma again!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,decent coffee but would skip on pastries. would come back to try their specials though
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Beautiful open space with a really warm feel to it! I'm not normally a coffee person, but everything I've tried here is absolutely delicious and always made with care and precision. Ana is lovely and personable as well as knowledgeable. You won't regret giving this special place a try!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much Daisy. We appreciate your support!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Great Place to Visit If your looking for something With that homemade authentic small batch taste then look no further and yes they roast their own coffee!! Best Coffee nearby!! This place by far beats any of the large coffee chains in flavor and quality. They also offer on the go coffee carriers/travelers for events or office use. This is the best coffee near me.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you for your thoughtful review.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,I tried this new cafe and really liked it. The staff is friendly and bilingual. The coffee drinks are delicious! I don't really like sweet drinks so I was hesitant to order their specialty drinks. The owner assured me they were not overly sweet. She was correct. The drinks were amazing! I'll definitely be back.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thanks for coming in Nelson. Looking forward to seeing you again soon!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"The drip coffee is disappointing, not too much better than Starbucks.  Would I enjoy sitting here for a rest? Maybe yes. The store is neat and artsy.  Would I feel weird? Also yes. The neat store, the ugly graffiti on the window glass, the chaotic, or vibrant,  street outside together render an ironical image, exactly revealing the California we live in today. I am not sure I can feel innocent and free of guilt sitting there and not thinking what is going on around the world."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you for taking the time to share your review.  Hope to be able to meet your coffee expectations next time if you are willing to visit again.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Lovely staff! Amazing coffee! Knowledgeable and passionate about their coffee. Would highly recommend!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much Simon. See you soon!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Pinolillo is a must try!!! It's their non-espresso drink for people who look for decaf options. It's like hot chocolate (because of cacao beans) but not too sweet and much more flavorful. Beautiful space, creative drinks, and friendly batista. Oh pastries were tasty as well."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much! Glad you enjoyed
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Awesome cafe de olla and drip coffee. Nice inside and outside seating. Thanks for the great addition to the neighborhood!
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much for stopping in! See you soon.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"No bathroom, not even for customers. No tables, only a bar along the window. This place could be much better, both as a cafe and to support the community. However I can't help but feel that those choices were deliberate and hostile.  They also overcharge for espresso."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Lovely new coffee shop in the Mission District. Nice and clean look, friendly baristas and good lattes and espresso. The Spinach and Feta croissant was also quite tasty. They have good Wi-Fi for those working or needing to use it real quick, no plugs so be prepared.  The Cafe con Morro is a specialty latte made with a Salvadoran twist. Really enjoyed the balance of the milk and coffee and that it wasn't too sweet!  I enjoy people watching the windows give you a little look into the Mission and I actually like that.  I'll be back!"
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much for your thoughtful review. We look forward to seeing you soon.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Unique coffee drinks based on good coffee. Unlike S****ucks using sugar to cover up bad coffee.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thanks for your review! Hope to see you soon.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Such a wonderful menu, some very unusual and delicious choices. These folks know their beans, and the owner is a delightful woman. Great service, nice setting."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Pleasant staff. Relaxed yet hip ambiance. Good coffee. I wish more people knew about the place and came. So I advise you to give it a try.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"Very friendly, great coffee - first time I ever had a Cortadito - welcoming atmosphere."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Ambience is good but didn’t like the cappuccino
Abanico Coffee Roasters,"I've tried the iced cafe de olla, cafe con coco y choco, cafe con leche, and cafe con morro. Consistently good drinks for a sweet (but not too sweet) treat and the staff is always so friendly. The cafe con morro is probably my favorite so far! The space is very open and full of light as well."
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much Brianna! We enjoy making all these favorites for you.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,The innovation of native Salvadorean ingredients in their coffee drinks brings me back to enjoy cafecito at Abanico! Ana and her staff are always friendly.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,Thanks Ricardo!

Abanico Coffee Roasters,Great coffee. A few pastries. I couldn’t get my usual half-caf because they don’t do decaf.
Abanico Coffee Roasters,The place looked empty and espresso tasted very strong and bitter. I don’t recommend it to anyone.
