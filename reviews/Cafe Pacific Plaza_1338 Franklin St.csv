Cafe Pacific Plaza,"One of my favourite places just round the corner from my apartment. Incredibly kind, friendly team & owners. Always greets you with a smile. I love how they remember my order and never say no to my own brought tupperware. I get take out from this place almost every week. Sometimes twice. Recommend it 100%"
Cafe Pacific Plaza,Perfect neighborhood spot for a quick bite. Owners are are friendly and attentive.  I noticed that they knew more than half of the customers by name.
Cafe Pacific Plaza,Only the locals know about it kind of eatery with an incredible electrofrying eclectic tasty menu served all day!  Lots of Korean influenced dishes served Bento Box style. I had the Hawaiian Break Fast ..... O HOW TAYSTEEEE! 1338 Franklin SF

Cafe Pacific Plaza,Hidden neighborhood gem with delicious and reasonably priced lunch. Service is super speedy and friendly.
Cafe Pacific Plaza,"This is the best spot for breakfast that have found so far in the city. I will say that the quests are mostly local construction workers and this that live close but don't let that distract you. They gave an amazing set of dishes like their Hawaiian breakfast and house omelet, both are amazing. What they don't have is a lot of flair but the flavor makes up for it."

Cafe Pacific Plaza,"Before going in, I thought it was a small place. Really didn’t expect it to have so many seatings (probably 20+), and 6 people working behind the  small counter. The operation was really efficient; I got my BLT sandwich in a few minutes when it’s busy at lunch time. The sandwich was perfect, the bacon crispy but not too burnt or dried. I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo before eating it. Lol. Price was really resealable. Will check out their Korean food next time."
Cafe Pacific Plaza,Awesome little mom'n'pop shop. I always get sandwiches in the afternoon or American style breakfasts in the morning and both are excellent. The korean BBQ is nice to change it up sometimes and the menu has some other stuff I haven't even tried yet

Cafe Pacific Plaza,"Came here for breakfast and was met by a very homey, Korean family owned hole in the wall. The family all spoke great English (one called me bruh) and were overall very hospitable and warm!  Food I had was simple (eggs, home fries, toast and sausage) but nicely done.  Will definitely be coming back"
