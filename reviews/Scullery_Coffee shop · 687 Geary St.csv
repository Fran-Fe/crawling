Scullery,"Cozy corner cafe with maybe 10 seats but coffee is very good, and avocado toast has high quality ingredients. The staff is also very friendly and thoughtful (the barista was pouring coffee into an insulated cup for another customer and made sure it was not precariously placed so the customer wouldn’t knock it over standing back up after petting my dog) ❤️"
Scullery,10/10 experience. I can only hope a cafe of this high quality means good things for this area. It is worth going out of your way for an exceptional cup of coffee. The salty PB and spicy strawberry jam was perfect. I cannot believe people go to Starbucks when places like this exist.
Scullery,We're glad you enjoyed your visit Jessica! Thank you for stopping by
Scullery,"Friendly service, some seating available inside. Salmon toast and matcha latte were good, I really liked the iced mocha. I recommend this place and would come back!"
Scullery,"A small and friendly cafe located in the heart of the Tenderloin. Their toast is thick and very chewy and their wide variety of toppings make it worth stopping by again. Their cream cheese toast was a fantastic combination of sweet and sour with just a hint of saltiness. Not the biggest fan of their version of Vietnamese Iced Coffee. There are plenty of other places around the Tenderloin where you can get it better and cheaper. If you go, stick to the more traditional options - I've heard their iced mochas are fantastic!"
Scullery,"Fantastic coffee and food; tasty yet simple menu. Friendly staff. Very clean and modern. I've had the avocado on tasty sourdough for 3 days now, the avocados are creamy and perfect. Coffee to die for. We are so going to miss this place now we are heading back home to NZ."
Scullery,"Really amazing coffee, although I didn’t get a regular coffee and went with the burnt caramel latte. They have a Vietnamese shakerato that I would love to try. Small space though with no indoor seating and two tables outside."
Scullery,I loved the hole in the wall coffee shop! I tried their specialty “Nola Kola” - a chicory cold brew with milk.  I also tried their spicy PB&J - a thick slice of multigrain toast with peanut butter and their jelly with a kick.  It seemed to be full of locals (with dogs) when I stopped in. Great menu and ambiance.
Scullery,"Nice little coffee shop. Very friendly staff and great service as well. Coffee was pretty good. Seating area is very small, customers mostly do to go orders. Avocado toast looked very tasty. I did not get a chance to eat, will surely try next time. Place does get busy in the morning."
Scullery,"Great use of space, easy to find, and absolutely amazing coffee. Was very happy with the quality of the coffee and the food. An entire toast menu just speaks to my soul :)"
Scullery,Coffee here is excellent. Service was very friendly and speedy.
Scullery,Cute small cafe. I ordered burnt caramel latte and pesto egg and they were delicious. I really like how green the place is. The staff were friendly
Scullery,"I love this little spot. The coffee and food is great, so it's no wonder they get busy in the morning. I highly recommend it!"
Scullery,Thank you for stopping by Mike! We're happy you enjoyed your visit 
Scullery,"Cute little spot for great coffee and toast! They use midwife and the baker bread, have a variety of options for toppings and it’s all fairly priced for SF. It’s small so not much space to sit but great for takeaway."
Scullery,"Such amazing and good coffee here; they are very talented at what they’re doing behind the counter. Small tiny space: only two outdoor tables and none inside, so this is a good place to grab and go."
Scullery,"Very nice and quick service, the food and coffee were amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the neighbourhood and the folk around the cafe. Felt unsafe"
Scullery,Hi Mantas! Thank you for you review and we're happy you enjoyed your service. We are at the edge of a tough neighborhood but I am optimistic that our section will be greatly improved when the building scaffolding comes down this week and businesses can put out our outdoor seating again.   
Scullery,"Famtastic boutique coffee shop. Super friendly staff who know how to make good coffee. Also great for a bite to eat with several breakfast options including delicious avacado on toast and Welsh rarebit. Very highly recommended and will make this our local while staying in SFO. If you like your coffee, you'll be doing yourself a diservice by not coming here."
Scullery,"First time visiting this place after excellent reviews, and I am hooked. This is a little-known breakfast nook that makes excellent hot chocolate, seasonal goodies, and flaky breads with meat. Although the space is compact, the meal and drink options make me want to consider waking up earlier some weekends and have this meal over Starbucks when I go to San Francisco. And its proximity to frequent bus lines is a bonus."
Scullery,Went next door to get fresh ripe avocado for my toast. Taste was amazing!
Scullery,"This place is the best.  Great coffee, great toasts and pastries.   Their Welsh Rarebit was sooo good, we had to order another one, even after we were full.  It’s the best!!! Get it with ham and ‘spicy tomato chutney’ (aka ‘ghost pepper tomato’)."
Scullery,"Wow, just their toast with a huge amount of avocado was enough for my lunch! It was VERY GOOD. Coffee was also excellent. My daughter got the cinnamon toast and it brought me ""back in time"" to when my mom would make it."
Scullery,Well when I woke up I was craving a decent coffee and a decent breakfast.... walking down the road..I stumbled upon this Lil gem! I had the green eggs and ham..pictured...and my fiancée had avocado toast w egg..she devoured b4 the pic! Also a latte I found fantastic!!!! A MUST go! Support them small shops!!!! They need it and r worth it!!!!!!
Scullery,Small magical coffee shop! The coffee is very good (oat milk cappucino) and the sevice was good! Avocado toast was maybe the best i had!! Good prices as well
Scullery,"Scullery was a great find in the SF Tenderloin area. Quick service and friendly staff with delicious coffee offerings. If you get a chance to get the maple apple bacon scone, grab one with your coffee, you won’t be disappointed. Really enjoyed stopping by Scullery, we were looking for a place that had some espresso offerings since we were staying in the area. Scullery is a hidden gem in SF."
Scullery,"You ever open a bag of your favorite coffee and take a deep whiff? That comforting feeling you get right then? That's what this place is like, every time. Not only will you get the best coffee you've ever had (with a lovable bear foam art) but you should also grab some avocado 🥑 toast because it was something I'll be craving for the rest of my life. I had the tomato edition, and it was topped with this sweet/savory/acidic tomato relish that complimented the fatty avocado perfectly. Mmmm."
Scullery,"Before I tasted my latte, I already love this place.  It’s so cute and cozy. Super friendly staff. And yeah, the latte is delicious."
Scullery,Amazing toast. I got the egg pesto and it was delish. Friendly and fast service. The only suggestion I have is other bread options would be nice. Although I enjoy the bread it was served on. My coffee was also top notch. Thanks!
Scullery,Best coffee in San Fran! Avocado toast is delicious and Cortado (standard comes with double shot) was amazing. Bonus for the cute bear 🥰🥰 …
Scullery,Really lovely coffee shop with amazing avocado toast and espresso. Recommend their ABJ toast with one of their spicy jams! A little spendy for everyday lattes but they also have delicious brewed coffee that does the trick.
Scullery,"Thanks Dulce,  Sorry I took us a while to thank you.  Best Sharon"
Scullery,Unassuming gem in SF. Small walk up with amazing locally roasted coffee and great toasts. Highly recommend !
Scullery,Best local coffee in the area. Highly recommend this spot for a pick and go. They offer artisan special coffees with a touch of art
Scullery,"Small coffee spot with friendly staff. The coffee is great but they charge an outrageous amount of money for speciality toasts that don't even look that great. Probably saw what other places like the Mill on Divisadero do and thought they could do the same, but it just doesn't land at all and you feel cheated."
Scullery,"Rah, Thx for your review did you try our toast? Our bread is from the midwife and the baker and is exclusive to Scullery it is larger than other toast places served in SF. We actually are priced the same as Mill although we did beat them for best toast of SF voted by SF magazine,  I hope we can win you over at Scullery if you try us again 😁"
Scullery,"Cute little place that’s next to my hotel. It’s small, only a few counter seats. Atmosphere is relaxing. Just that they drizzle extra oil on avo toast that’s a bit too much for me. Toast is great, has seeds and taste chewy"
Scullery,Small takeaway coffee shop that features locally roasted specialty coffee and fantastic toasts! Avocado toast with egg is a hit and everything from their batch brewed coffee to their more extravagant drinks like the Vietnamese shakerato and the burnt caramel latte are just what you want.  It is takeaway only though so don’t plan to stay too long…
Scullery,"To be honest, I didn't really like the coffee and the baristas were not particularly friendly. I absolutely loved the logo though!"
Scullery,Found this place during my stay close by - the place is cozy and I was a big fan of the little benches in the front (especially as a visitor to the city). The toast and chai were yummy - would definitely recommend!
Scullery,"Friendly service, great coffee and a confident boast that the avocado toast is “The Best” which I’m happy to report it was and just what a jet lagged Brit needed to start his day 🙏🏼 …"
Scullery,Top notch avo toast and a full coffee menu to match serving sight glass beans.
Scullery,"Great atmosphere, and also making a perfect iced latte."
Scullery,Hi Hanne! Thanks for stopping by. We’re glad you enjoyed your latte
Scullery,"This was such a find! I had coffee and avocado on toast, made fresh and lots of avo, just right for breakie. The price was good as well."
Scullery,"Awesome little coffee shop... great coffee, great breakfast options and great gluten free bread... worth a visit."
Scullery,Perfect mocha and cute latte art! Great way to start the day exploring San Francisco ☕🎉 …
Scullery,Very good quality coffee with friendly staff.
Scullery,The coffee is on point - it’s right around the corner from our hotel. Burnt caramel tastes as good as any creme brûlée I’ve had. Plus spicy pbj!
Scullery,I love that place. Small cute café with super friendly staff. Whenever I come to San Francisco I stop by to have an almond croissant and a coffee. & thanks for the lemon bread!
Scullery,So obsessed with this place. I went here each morning I was staying here and got the TL drink. Definitely recommend! Get the toast too! The pumpkin butter was great!
Scullery,"If you junst need half-decent coffee on the run it's probably ok. But it's not a cafe, it's just a Tiny hole in the wall with no place to open a computeror sit comfortably- seating is 3 stools, no place to work, paper cups only, out of almost all pastries (I got an inedibly stale coffee cake). Evidently they have a to-go business involving boxed goods that is consuming most of their effort."
Scullery,Absolutely delicious coffee and toasts! We were visiting from out of town for 3 days and came here twice because it was so good.
Scullery,"My pup and I visited the city for a few days, and I’m pretty sure this cafe was the highlight of her trip. Great coffee, delicious toast and pastries, amazing staff."
Scullery,Amazing food and coffee! Wonderful staff! A must visit when you are in SF!
Scullery,Best coffee I've had in San Francisco so far. Will be back to try more of the menu. Maple bacon scone was delicious.
Scullery,"Had a spicy ABJ and oat milk latte.  Friendly and welcoming service, good coffee and loved the spicy touch to the almond butter and jelly toast.  Delicious!"
Scullery,Excellent food. Great start to the day!
Scullery,This place has really delicious Vietnamese Coffee and you can sub out the milk with alternatives. We had the cream cheese toast and also the pesto omelet on the toast and both were super delicious. There is two outdoor tables where you can eat your food. Very compliant with all the covid policies. Highly recommend and the staff is really friendly.
Scullery,"Best Chais in the nation, good & quick service"
Scullery,Amazing coffee! The owner is super friendly and helpful.
Scullery,Great coffee. Try the Avocado and egg toast its perfect
Scullery,"Parking wasn't very convenient cause I had to park 2 blocks away but the shop was a mini coffee shop with super yummy Vietnamese coffee. If this is your first time trying it, definitely should come here for their Vietnamese coffee. Super good! Price was $5 for that size so it was acceptable."
Scullery,"Fantastic coffee, coming from an Australian. Best coffee we've had since coming to the US. Well worth the trip if you're in the area"
Scullery,"I didn’t get to my hotel in San Francisco until almost midnight and woke up at 4:00 am because I’m still on East Coast time. Luckily, Scullery is just around the block. Thankfully, it’s open by 6:45 am and the coffee is terrific. I’ve enjoyed a cappuccino and a honey lavender latte, so far, and both are delicious."
Scullery,"Scullery was recommended to me when I moved into the TL. It has become my local coffee, breakfast, toasts, etc shop. This place was good on first visit but keeps blowing my mind! The coffee is good and varied in hot and cold options without veering anywhere near S*bucks coffee flavored over roasted ""drinks"" territory. The Vietnamese style shakerato is tasty. And the food options are amazing and have lots of unique tastes in the British tradition highlighted by the name. The Yorkie and Welsh Rarebit will more than satisfy physical hunger and an emotional need for craft comfort breakfast/brunch/lunch/snack/just because."
Scullery,Well. The quality of everything in the product & service made this 5 stars.  The big cats like that.  There's limited seating but the bones make this place legit.   From quality coffee to excellent eggs & avocados on toast this place is highly recommended.   So get your purr on with coffee & breakfast on sourdough toast!
Scullery,"Great cup of coffee, thanks!  Kept me awake during this presentation..."
Scullery,"TLDR: Tries way to hard, for not good food  Overall this place is egh, it just tries so hard to make things that are not great and lack flavor or have a bad flavor. Food is covered up with extreme salt or pepper. Coffee is terrible and the cups they use disintegrate."
Scullery,Great coffee and friendly staff!
Scullery,This was my first time at Discovery. I got the dose of the leche flatte and the avocado toast. Both are incredible items. I've never had a dolce de leche not day before but this one is really good. Customer service is also a top notch here. The guys working here I think there were three of them they were all very friendly really really good coffee I would say.
Scullery,I'm a Starbucks customer not from here. If Scullery was in my home area it would be bye- bye Starbucks. Scullery's latte and cold brew are excellent choices .  We had the Avocado toast and cinnamon toast perfect for the start of the day
Scullery,Super cute! Good coffee!
Scullery,Cute family run place with hard workers and quick turn around. Avo toast was especially worthy
Scullery,Simply one of the best coffee shops in America. Surprisingly low prices. Take a coffee here each weekend
Scullery,This is a good place. With a good espresso! And a bear face on your cappuccino
Scullery,"Got an iced Americano there to drink with a breakfast sandwich I got down the street. When I went to throw my cup and the bag out the bald guy working flipped out saying I couldn't throw my trash away there (despite buying most of my trash, ie plastic cup, from them in the first place) and told me to go back where I got my literal paper bag for trash to throw it away. Absolutely ridiculous. Other guy working was really nice, but all in all skip this place and go to Bandit two stops down where they have a semblance of decency."
Scullery,Nice spot! The food and coffee was so good. Service is very accomodating. Would definitely come back!
Scullery,Coffee is good. Friendly staff. Very limited seating (only two small tables outside and none inside). Eggs were underdone. Meh
Scullery,"Friendly, great coffee, and the toast was so good."
Scullery,"A local coffee staple serving everything you'd expect-- the usual coffee selection, to the typical San Francisco treats (avocado toast, toast with butter sugar and cinnamon etc).  Everything they make is really good, the only knock is that it's a more pricey than your average coffee shop.  If you're in the area craving coffee, or just looking for a more authentic San Francisco coffee experience, then this shop is worth checking out."
Scullery,A charming little cafe specializing in sweet and savory toast in downtown SF.
Scullery,"Great cup of coffee, friendly service and some fun and delicious specials! Their homemade syrups and concoctions are very good."
Scullery,"Shop is cute and tidy, barista was extremely friendly and helpful! We had the nitro cold brew and it was delicious! Had just eaten but next time we want to try the toast!"
Scullery,Cozy warm coffeeshop with friendly staff and regulars. Great spot for local coffee snobs and travelers who wants to feel the local vibe. 😌😌😌 …
Scullery,"Delicious toast and drinks. Really you wouldn't think something so simple could be so good but it is. They have perfected the art of toast. On top of this the coffee is very good, I especially recommend the burnt caramel latte!"
Scullery,Thx phillip
Scullery,"Coming from Miami, Florida where avocado toast is life...this blows everyone out of the water! The display and taste of their avocado toast (I add an egg on top) is absolutely divine. Their chai latte and matcha lattes are to die for, too!"
Scullery,"My companion and I, as Italian were in hight need for a good coffee. I happily found this local shop! It's a perfect easygoing place where have a break or take away. We had delicious croissants and nice chats with the cosy stuff. We also had great tips about old local restaurant in the city."
Scullery,Thanks Nicole glad you enjoyed our cafe Enjoy SF
Scullery,"Excellent place. Amazing food, amazing service. Also, some of the better coffee I’ve had in quite some time. Definitely worth the trip."
Scullery,"Great avocado toast, with garlic oil and pepper."
Scullery,This place is recognized by local publications for the quality of its toasts and the awards don't lie. Great little spot to stop for some morning snacks and quality coffee. There isn't much seating so you might have to be prepared to take whatever you order to-go.
Scullery,"Lovely interior, quick service, amazing food and drink. Wonderful place to grab breakfast or lunch.  Also friendly & skilled staff! 🙂"
Scullery,"I come here regularly for a good cup of latte or flat white. The baristas are super friendly and warm. I also buy my coffee beans from here as they sell Sightglass beans and I like them. Major plus is they are dog friendly. Place is tiny though but cosy. I do wish they opened longer hours but overall, highly recommend!"
Scullery,Dont let the location stop you from visiting Scullery. Delicious crema meets espresso and perfectly steamed milk. The Baristas are very friendly and welcome everyone. Two cute seats outside for your comfort. Definitely stop by whenever I have the chance
Scullery,"Are you looking for good coffee and toast with numerous options (jam, cheese, etc.)? If so, you’ll enjoy this Scottish-themed hole-in-the-wall cafe. Try the bread pudding. The “Welsh rarebit” is a fancy name for grilled cheese. Minus one star for the small space. (April 2018)"
Scullery,Thx Mateo
Scullery,Nice coffee with unique flavours
Scullery,Nitro cold brew with condensed milk(the tenderloin) is my favorite! Very friendly staff and delicious toast! So happy to have this in the neighborhood! They should add breakfast sandwiches to the menu!
Scullery,Thanks krista  We are limited with our menu due to our size but may consider it in the future  Best sharon
Scullery,"Great conversation, great coffee, and great breakfast! I had the Yorkie which was delicious and my friends had the rarebit and the avocado toast which were both amazing as well.  Would definitely go back"
Scullery,"Good coffee, blueberry cake, but not very friendly. I tried multiple times to initiate small talk but to no avail. I want to talk to my coffee every morning, make sense?"
Scullery,"This was such a fantastic discovery! Went for a walk and found this place. Awesome cold brew! Also, the baristas are very knowledgeable and friendly so we discussed how to make my own cold brew at home. The best delight was playing HQ Royal Edition with one of the baristas!"
Scullery,Thx Steven
Scullery,"Delicious coffe and toasts, super nice stuff. Great place for breakfast!"
Scullery,"French inspired oasis in Union Square. Delicious coffee and delectable sweet & savory eats. The avocado toast with garlic oil, rock salt, & sauteed egg is sublime <3"
Scullery,Great coffee and excellent toast.
Scullery,Quaint little Cafe. Good for the quick morning bite. They have a rad selection of avocado toasts and breakfast toasts alike. The coffee is good and service is better. Stop by on your way to work.
Scullery,Thanks Michael
Scullery,"One of my favorite coffee shops in San Francisco! The staff is incredibly helpful, kind, and generous. I can't say enough great things. Highly recommended!"
Scullery,"I was very excited to get a latte after seeing they serve SightGlass espresso however, i was sorely disappointed. I ordered an overly expensive quad latte and The Scottish dude behind the counter gave me a double latte, wouldn't fix it, and to top it off the beverage was scalding hot. Just take my advice and go to SightGlass. its down the road. they make their lattes with precision and love. every cup is perfect and the milk is steamed to 135-140 so you dont burn off your tongue and the espresso is  dosed correctly so you get the right complexity."
Scullery,"Sorry that you had a bad experience at scullery, I hope you try us again"
Scullery,"Amazing coffee, toast, and staff - can’t wait to come back!"
Scullery,Fantastic! You almost don't want to eat this beautiful food or put a lid on the coffee creations. Almost. But it's too good not to!
Scullery,Yorkshire pudding was soupy and dripping with butter.
Scullery,Delicious toast - got the spicy almond butter & jelly. Cute place I'd love to go back to to try their Welsh rarebit!
Scullery,Great coffee and tasty light toasts! Seating is limited (as with other similar cafes in the area) but the staff is very friendly and Scullery feels more like visiting a friend than a cafe.
Scullery,This is by far the best coffee in San Francisco.  They use sightglass beans but the actual drinks are superior to SGs.  The staff is friendly and they always remember my regular order.
Scullery,Excellent bread from The Midwife and The Baker. Great avocado toast and ABJ (almond butter and raspberry chipotle jam). Cute little place. Sightglass coffee.
Scullery,"Tiny, rustic little place with great coffee, but I was disappointed with the cinnamon toast. Too much butter and not enough cinnamon, so just an expensive slice of buttered toast."
Scullery,Best toast and best latte! Perfect choice for breakfast :)
Scullery,"Super cute! My drinks tasted good, this place is legit."
Scullery,Had a really yummy cappuccino! Didn’t have the food but it was looking gooooodddd
Scullery,Great coffee and food. Perfect combination.
Scullery,Excellent Café Cortado and Morning Bun. Worth a side trip for both. Rivals home product at Sunergos.
Scullery,"Cute, bright coffee shop that’s very centrally located. Friendly staff and yummy selection of toasts!"
Scullery,Excellent coffee and the avocado toast was delicious
Scullery,Delicious coffee and great toast! Was running back an hour ago to get second americano fix! Thank you for keeping place safely open.
Scullery,"Their seasonal lattes are always delicious. If the Thanksgiving Toast is available, get it!"
Scullery,"The coffee was good, but I was hoping for more of a chill, European café vibe where I could hang out for a while. It's too small to be comfortable for that in my opinion."
Scullery,Best coffee around!
Scullery,"Excellent, prompt service - great avocado toast and fresh coffee - very happy to recommend."
Scullery,"Amazing coffee!! Also tried one of their breakfast items for the first time, the Yorkie - get this!"
Scullery,Delightful coffee. Yummy toast. Friendly staff. Great breakfast!
Scullery,The burt caramel latte is absolutely amazing. Anytime someone comes to visit its on of the first places I take them.

Scullery,Coffee is good. Period.
Scullery,Thank you for your review Yeondong. We appreciate you coming in!

Scullery,Very cute place. Excellent coffee. And I can see why the toast is award-winning!
Scullery,Absolutely incredible food and coffee! Service was top notch! I would give 10 stars if I could!
Scullery,Best Avo w/ egg toast I’ve ever had. Please patronize this place so the TL doesn’t lose anymore great gems
Scullery,"Friendly and helpful service, strong coffee and the Welsh Rarebit and Avocado Toast were tasty."
