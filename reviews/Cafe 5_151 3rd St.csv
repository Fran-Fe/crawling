Cafe 5,"We went there on New Year's Eve when it poured outside (2022). We had no choice but to have lunch here but the food was pretty good. Food comes out quickly, how they operate is pretty efficient, and the vibe is great. Wish it didn't rain so that we could enjoy outside as well."
Cafe 5,"Hello Christina Jeong, happy to hear your favorable feedback here: thanks much. Good to note that you had a positive experience at the Cafe. Due to the weather the seating was limited, indeed. Hope you can re-visit us as and when those weather conditions are more favorable. Meanwhile, stay well & safe."
Cafe 5,"Nice cafe with great a great vibe. Surprisingly good for a museum cafe, we enjoyed the experience! We only had Americano’s and the coffee cake. The coffee cake was ok, a bit dry and tasted more like a citrus cake. Wont order that again, but the other food looked good that came out of the kitchend."
Cafe 5,"Hello Jo V, thanks for the favorable review here; much appreciated. Look forward to welcome you back soon again. Meanwhile, stay safe & well."
Cafe 5,We arrived and one of us went up to order at the counter and the other found a free table and they scolded us for not following their seating system. But the system isn’t written anywhere and we weren’t informed when we walked in. We saw others walk in an have the same unpleasant experience. Otherwise the coffee is pretty good and the strawberry sponge is tasty.
Cafe 5,"Hello jessica Picton,  thanks for the rating and feedback provided here, much appreciated. Apologies for giving way to any inconvenience. Appreciate sharing the insights and remain assured we will look into the details highlighted. Regarding the seating protocol; during rain-days seating is highly limited and in order to avail seating most considerable; guest need to order food/beverages prior to be seated. Otherwise tables are occupied with guest waiting, whilst those orders on the way; are unable to find seating. Hope this helps and again our apologies for giving way to any."
Cafe 5,"The rooftop setting is definitely nice, the food is surprisingly great for a museum so keep it up in the kitchen and they only loose a star because of the attitude at the cashier."
Cafe 5,"Hello V Maxeno, thanks much for your favorable review here; certainly appreciated. Thanks also for highlighting where we fell short; we will work on improving that area. Meanwhile, look forward to welcome you back again & stay healthy & safe."
Cafe 5,Pretty Café with really nice outdoor seating. We got the Oolong perfume caramel aubeurresale tea & an oat milk latte. Cafe is located on the 5th floor. Took a few minutes to find.
Cafe 5,"Hello Kayla, thanks for the favorable feedback provided here. We will share it with the Team, for sure. Looking forward to welcome you back, soon again. Stay safe & well."
Cafe 5,"Absolutely awful chicken wings, solid as a brick, small plates, so your food is always on the table not on the plate. And the price was too high for “that” misunderstanding. Unpleasant lady who rudely told me not to seat at the table until I make order but I was already waiting for a husband who was making an order. Highly not recommended"

Cafe 5,"Shockingly good for a museum cafe, with truly California touches like hot-smoked steelhead trout salad topped with German potato salad, served on plates that remind me of the Tartine Manufactory. Pastries such as the excellent croissant are from Craftsman and Wolves, an excellent local bakery. There's a view of an outdoor sculpture garden and the hard-to-see undulating white backside of the new building that you can't spot from the street."
Cafe 5,"Nice lunch at a reasonable price, out in the sunshine on the balcony with views of sculpture. Service was friendly and quick. Table service was friendly and efficient. It was just what I wanted, and a meal and drink (chicken sandwich and ice tea) at a nice cafe all for under $25. Will return."
Cafe 5,absolutely loved it!! great food and great service! 6/5 stars
Cafe 5,"Hello Mallory, thanks much for the great review here, much appreciated by one and all at the Cafe. Look forward to welcome you back.  Stay well & safe!"
Cafe 5,"It was a nice respite after spending several hours exploring this large museum. Probably best to order from the prepared bagels and sandwiches for best value. We had a nice quinoa salad with beets, orange tomatoes, broccoli and pistachios and a factory salad with asparagus, olives, mushrooms, cheese wedges, and bread sticks. Everything was beautifully presented and quite good. The coffee was good too."
Cafe 5,"Great open ambiance with indoor and outdoor sitting area connected through huge wall of glasses. A good mid-way stop on the fifth floor to get some rest, get some quality time with your friends and chill-out in general. The menu is decent too and the coffee is good enough. Go for Americano rather than just coffee if you want something stronger. They also provide water and plastic cups for free and don't mind you using the place as a rest stop even if you don't buy anything. A great touch."
Cafe 5,"How hard is it to make a cup of tea?! It's just hot water and a tea bag. However, heating water to anywhere near boiling is evidently too difficult a task here. My first pot ($4 for about 16oz water and 1 tea bag) was barely warm, yet I was so desperate for some tea I drank it anyway and optimistically ordered another one, which was even worse. The water was so tepid the tea barely even brewed. At least they have soy milk and honey.  The vegetable cassoulet was tasty but quite small. Good cheesecake. Extra stars for ambiance. Terrible service."
Cafe 5,We drank some coffee and ate some sweets. The baked goods were of great quality. Service was great too.
Cafe 5,"Hello Renske Hostyn, thank yo very much for your favorable feedback here. The crew will be happy to read your input. Hope to see you back at the Cafe; soon again. meanwhile: stay safe & well!"
Cafe 5,"We got the Vegan vegetable lentil salad, the chicken croquettes, and a raspberry donut. The salad and donut were delicious but the croquettes were small and not worth the price. If you’re coming here now, get the pork special over the croquettes."
Cafe 5,Would be a nice place if u are local or know their protocol. Otherwise they can be rude. Hubby lined up to order food and I took a seat at a vacant table. Was told off for not observing their protocol which is not written on the table or explained when we entered the cafe. Am fr Singapore and speaking English the whole time but a waitress asked if I speak Chinese. Maybe I need to apologise for my accent too. Probably won’t get to visit again anyway but will remember this place for sure.
Cafe 5,"Visiting the SFMOMA is enough of a treat by itself, but being able to dine inside on high quality food only makes it better. Cafe 5 offers both inside and outside eating with a full lunch menu, pastries and assortment of drinks. Prices are roughly $15 dollars for most lunch dishes and 6 for pastries. Staff seems to be a bit aloof which can be good if you don't mind waiting around, otherwise it might be annoying."
Cafe 5,"Big recommend😋食物新鮮美味，健康有機的料理。fresh, delicious, healthy and organic. …"
Cafe 5,No vegan food options. Not acceptable in a setting that should cater to all museum-goers.
Cafe 5,"Hello Ben Singer, thanks for the review here. Unfortunate to note that we have not been able to provide you with a satisfying option. Whilst we do have a variety of menu selections available (V, Vg) it appears these have not been of your preference. Pls note that we certainly like to accommodate -where possible- additional needs our clientele may have. For such, like to invite you to engage with our floor manager for review. Look forward to welcome you back and provide you with a better experience: next time. Meanwhile; stay well & safe."
Cafe 5,"Feisty counter person served up tons of attitude. The lunch, however, was amazing. Overshadowing the poor performance of the counter person."
Cafe 5,"Hello Stephen Parise, thanks for sharing the insights on your recent visit to the Cafe5. We will use this to our Team's benefit and training guidance. Happy to note that the Lunch has been exceeding your expectations. Thanks again, stay well & be safe; till we meet again."
Cafe 5,The open space with lots of light make's it a very enjoyable place. Great place to have a coffee break while touring Moma. But the food is a little better than airport food.
Cafe 5,"Excellent food, excellent coffee, excellent system. Lovely views! Good place to sit, eat and stay. Staff is very kind and intuitive."
Cafe 5,Loved the pea soup and cheddar quiche.  Beautiful patio
Cafe 5,Very enjoyable and luminous rooftop restaurant with tasty California food. This is certainly not run-of-the-mill museum food.
Cafe 5,"Lovely space, hosts were really nice, 3 stars though because waitress had attitude."
Cafe 5,Great coffee!
Cafe 5,"Hello TG,  Thanks for the acknowledgement here: much appreciated! Look forward to welcome you back, soon again. Stay safe & well!"

Cafe 5,"Would be a great place, if they knew how to operate an espresso machine."
Cafe 5,"Nice space, with fairly priced drinks"
Cafe 5,Very enjoyable and luminous rooftop restaurant with tasty California food :)
Cafe 5,Food was good... service was the worst... cashier/wait staff... had to go ask for my food at the cashier
Cafe 5,Nice place to take a break in
Cafe 5,"You can have tea on the large outside terrace or inside. You can also enjoy the subtle appearance of the museum. Cakes are expensive, but delicious."
Cafe 5,"There are a bit of people, but the staff are friendly and the taste is good."
Cafe 5,"Thanks Yannic, Meanwhile: stay safe & be well, until we meet again."
