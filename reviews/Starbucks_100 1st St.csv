Starbucks,"Hidden little Starbucks in the financial district - much less crowded than the one on the corner of Battery and Clay. Service is fast, store was clean and basically empty. No waiting for drinks and food and no crowd. Definitely a good place sto stop on the way to work."
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,There isn't any tables inside just 1 booth and I guess it's a bay window. But you can't use the bathroom unless you buy something (alot of the restaurant and shops are like that). Otherwise the food and drinks aren't bad.

Starbucks,"Had a coffee this morning and witnessed a rare scene of a team working together in friendly and supportive atmosphere. Special thanks to initiative girl that helped me on 14th, in the morning, when I lost my place in line."
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,It was warmer outside than inside. I wanted somewhere to sit have some water and finish some personal business but it was freezing inside :(

Starbucks,"Please bring back sitting places, it’s so bad that in CA it’s so hard to find Starbucks where you can sit and work 😥 in NJ everywhere they have it! Covid time is done… …"
Starbucks,"Instant 1 star for laziness / knowingly making the wrong drink. The label said decaf but the batista served me regular anyway. I cannot have caffeine due to a heart defect...  I let the batista know and she apologized and switched it for me, but that's not the kind of thing they can ignore. I also asked for vanilla at the front and the cashier did not mark that correctly. Starbucks already charges too much, they should at least make the right drink."
Starbucks,"I was a regular customer at this Starbuck's.  I spent on average $40 a week there.  I always got a Venti coffee with two raw sugar and extra cream.  This morning (05OCT22) in the 6 AM hour, I ordered my coffee and a sausage cheddar breakfast sandwich.  There were 4 people behind the counter and not many in the shop.  I had to leave after waiting 11 minutes and I did not get my order.  I have to get to my job and don't have a long time to wait.  This is a poor way to treat a regular customer.  I will not return there again."

Starbucks,"The place is well maintained, service is friendly. Toilets are slightly dirtier."
Starbucks,"On Saturday afternoon, you can find a chair to sit. The store is clean; the complimentary Wi-Fi is fast. It's probably different if coming during the week."
Starbucks,"My morning go to coffee spot near Transamerica. You'd think they would staff more than 2 or sometimes even 1 person in a location like this! Sometimes I get a really good on the ball barrista that can run alone, sometimes there are 3 stooges there that cannot get it together. Needs management, to regulate quality control. Good products, enjoy the Machiatto Caramel and egg bites on the go often here."
Starbucks,The workers on Wednesday morning at 10 am were really rude!

Starbucks,Ordered drinks from here on Uber eats yesterday. I received a wrong order of a drink I could not have. Typically there’s an option on Uber eats to review receipt and receive a refund but there was not that option with this particular location. I was unable to report to Uber that I received a wrong item. Just know that if you order a drink off a third party delivery service that you may get the wrong item and be unable to get a refund. Does not make me want to order from this location again. Not sure if all Starbucks don’t allow reporting of incorrect items or receiving refunds.
Starbucks,"Starbucks use to be a place where I could enjoy a decent cup of coffee. But since the pandemic the staff like at some locations tend to do business for themselves, I ordered an expresso drink , paid for of course and received all the garnishment with no expresso"
Starbucks,"The first few times I came to this Starbucks, I had no issues, there were two young and really polite Asian men baristas that I liked were usually there. But my last two times here there were a couple of women baristas that just give off the rudest vibe. One I can already name, Mae. The first out of the last 2 times I was there, she was already giving off a NOT polite vibe, when I ordered she said ""For here or to go""  and I am thinking ""Um its Starbucks and I am ordering a drink..?"" Then when I showed her both my vaccination proof AND my ID, she stared at it for longer than anyone I have showed it too has, even in Germany people never read it for longer . So maybe their English ia better than hers...? On top of that the taller Asian woman barista kept staring at me weird every 5-10 minutes when I was just on my phone and sipping my drink. Otherwise this Starbucks is fine."
Starbucks,"Good coffee, no ashy flavor and the bkfast sandwich was better than Peets"
Starbucks,Really great Starbucks. And that's coming from someone that works for the company. Partners were very friendly even though it was close to closing. Still seemed genuinely happy to see us. The store was clean and the drinks made perfect. Kyra was extremely friendly and let me take a San Francisco card as a souvenir. You guys are really walking Starbucks values.
Starbucks,"It's your typical Starbucks - glad to see it's still open during COVID. I always order ahead on the mobile app, so I've never had trouble waiting. Staff have always been pleasant and friendly in my experience.  Additionally, they have the nitro cold brew here which is one of my faves!"
Starbucks,"Great hot coffee. Not packed. Plenty of places to sit, including a handicapped table."
Starbucks,"Very mute and unwelcoming Starbucks. They don't great anyone, white, black, asian people very very rude don't even ask you what you want, don't NOT come here there are 30,000 Starbucks that treat you better."
Starbucks,"Ok spot for coffee. Service is inconsistent. Employees seem disinterested in providing a pleasant customer experience. Definitely not my first choice, but convenient when there's nothing else open."
Starbucks,"Usually good service...until now. Placed mobile order, arrived early enough to see person finishing my drink. Person filled the cup leaving half an inch from the top and covered it. I had to ask this person to top it off. Had I not been standing there watching, I would have been ripped off!"
Starbucks,Good service here though they probably will get your name wrong 😂 and it can be a bit busy unless you're there at 5:30 or 6am …
Starbucks,Awesome place! Most of the stuff here work hard & are very nice. They don't care who you are UNLIKE  Starbucks on Drum street they seem to be discriminative: they can't  give a cup of water if you are black. This place is just awesome. Thank you for all you do here!
Starbucks,Worst starbucks ever. Staff is nice and friendly but slow.  There is not enough place to sit. Mural plugs are not functioning so you cannot charge any electronic device. There is only one bathroom which is crowded. Cleanliness is not at its top either.
Starbucks,"Horrible Starbucks experience! I couldn’t believe how a “Manager Allison” would conduct herself in a way where we felt discriminated against., over a coffee refill, we are talking about .50 cents. I’m guessing this is a norm for her. We’re pretty sure we are not the first she harassed over .50 cents. We have high expectations for the quality service Starbucks always provide, except for today. Manager Allison is an ugly look for representing Starbucks. Very disappointed in her representation of Starbucks."
Starbucks,"Good service, but totally burnt the coffee. Need to learn how to pull a proper shot."
Starbucks,"Hello! I’m sorry to hear that your beverage was less than great. For future visits, please know that any Starbucks partner (employee) would be happy to remake your beverage at no additional cost. If you'd like to share this feedback with our team, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs)!"
Starbucks,"this place is always busy, but very fast. they handle traffic really well and make drinks in under several minutes. the place is spacious, so you don't feel cramped up"
Starbucks,"Nice, spacious coffee place with free Wi-Fi for you to work and have a good drink at the same time. Love the ambience of the place, but I was less than impressed to hear they close at 8 pm in the evenings. Definitely worth a visit."
Starbucks,"After 9am it dies down considerably, before then it's often crowded with frustrated staff but friendly and efficient."
Starbucks,The oat milk latte is great !
Starbucks,Hi there! We're so glad you had a wonderful experience. Thanks for sharing it with us!
Starbucks,"Came in early on a typical 5:00 am Monday to grab a cup of coffee for a refill when we were pushed away by the manager name Allison. She yelled out loud in front of other customers that we could not get a coffee refill for .50 cents. Yelling vulgar language... to us it felt like she was being discriminatory. We’ve never experience this type of “hellish” customer service from Starbucks. We’ve been to many Starbucks all over the US and this by far the worse. This “ Manager Allison” does not signify, not remotely aligned with Starbucks Mission and Values."
Starbucks,"Products are good, very busy, staff tries but often fails on efficient service. Just don't expect fast service during peak hours. If in no hurry, have fun and leave a tip for most who apparently don't. Enjoy"
Starbucks,Very nice staff. We stopped in there every day because we are less than a block away. It is a very busy place and the employees that work there to a really good job of trying to keep up.
Starbucks,It is 4am and my friend and I visited this spot. The Asian guy with the moustache extremely assuming and disrespectful. He just threw our drinks at us without a word. He treated us like garbage and ghosts with his silence and didn't even say thank you to us after we ordered. Fire him please.
Starbucks,Not a single chair. Avoid if you need to do some work.
Starbucks,"Hello, I'm sorry to hear about this but appreciate you for sharing your experience. If you'd like additional assistance from our team, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs)!"
Starbucks,"considering the area its located and how generally busy it is there, i was able to order my drink and received it quickly. And I enjoyed it too lol. It was cold and tasted great."
Starbucks,When I was homeless I used to go there every day...Mainly to use their bathroom and their wi-fi...But they never gave me any problems. I would usually try to buy a drink but $5.25 is a lot of money when you are homeless.
Starbucks,"All Starbucks, US, UK, Spain, Italy, Finland.... Are equally disappointing. Feels like the McDonald's of coffee, just food prepared in the quickest and most careless way!"
Starbucks,"I  am very surprise that other costumer had same situation like me, JARED, is the name of the guy, very rude, I was there and ask for the bathroom, and he said me that it is only for costumer and if I will buy something, I said maybe yes or not because I needed use the bathroom and when I try to show him my Starbucks apps on my cellphone he though that I took a pic of him. Then he understands that I am costumer and say me that he asks if I am costumer. He really was very rude, not have manners. He is the only one rude that I found after be in San Francisco for 12 days. I called Tricia the district manager, I was worry that maybe the guys there not have a good time when they work, but maybe is only JARED. And btw the bathroom was very dirty."
Starbucks,"Came in here for maybe my first time. Place is around the corner from my office. Decent size, friendly employees just pumping out the orders. Not a lot of places to sit. Not good for large groups."
Starbucks,"Just opposite my school, this place is where we almost visit every day for the break. The service is good as usual. There is small concern they could upgrade there is no rest room inside."
Starbucks,"JaRed (as displayed on his name tag) was rude and spacey, making me jump through hoops to fix an issue with stocking on the app. It was an issue that should have taken 30 seconds to fix but left me wasting 10 minutes. I know this because this location has failed to update its app’s stock on multiple occasions (meaning the app thought the product I wanted to order was sold out). It didn’t feel like there will be any resolution to this locations poor accounting as a result of my repeated feedback. I’m switching to the 555 California st location."
Starbucks,"Typical Starbucks. Peppermint hot chocolate, great music, good Wi-Fi. Great place to take a time out, relax, connect online and get ready to roll again."
Starbucks,"Good service, same quality of food and drink from any Starbucks. We were here while visiting SFO and were treated very well by staff at this location."
Starbucks,This place is great very clean friendly staff and busy location near Financial District Broadway. I will definitely go back again when I'm in the neighborhood thanks again!
Starbucks,Not what it used to be ! ☕ Still good brew though ( but where is the Komodo dragon blend or House blend for example !?!) What'd the 🥐☕🧇🍵 …
Starbucks,I said I wanted normal cappuccino the woman assumed herself it is a frapuccino. do you guys know about cappuccino?? I had to take an order and go with it bad experience
Starbucks,"During my morning Saturday visit I saw four homelesses seating, sleaping, laudly speaking with self. Not relaxing place to enjoy of drinking coffee"
Starbucks,"When it's prime time in the mornings, waiting for regular coffee is fast. Waiting for baked goods will be about 5-10 minute wait."
Starbucks,"Not bad at all,fast service but the space it's not big enough for this location and it's hard to get in with a wheelchair.Not becuase I'm a handicap or neither I have a wheelchair but I have seen other customers trying to get on the store."
Starbucks,I was staying in the Hilton financial district and I came here multiple times during my trip. They were very timely and I had absolutely no complaints
Starbucks,"Well, a starbuck with nothing special. But that starbuck was probably the dirtiest starbuck I've ever stopped by. Plus toilets are locked and it is quite painful to get into it..."
Starbucks,The service was great eat people were friendly and the Starbucks Cards were in every way Awesome!
Starbucks,"restroom were locked, very inconvient when need to use before order, especially when long line. Went to the other SB instead."
Starbucks,Super crowded i'm pretty sure I'm one of the only people who didn't order in advance... Took forever.
Starbucks,"The mocha was quite tasteless, as well Z the hot chocolate. The location is kind of dull. And there really isn't much room to work."
Starbucks,"It’s a Starbucks so I’m going to skip all the generic Starbucks stuff and rate this one against other Starbucks  Cons: 1) The building is a bit cramped 2) The bathrooms have a lock system on them (makes sense, but when compared to Starbucks that don’t have them, well, it’s a negative) 3) They give you paper straws that seem to fall apart"
Starbucks,Been there about 5 times and they have bad adherence to customer drink customization. Luckily there's a Starbucks 2 minutes walk down clay.
Starbucks,Lazy staff close up before the advertised closing time :(
Starbucks,"Hello, I'm sorry to hear about this but appreciate you for sharing your experience. If you'd like additional assistance from our team, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs)!"
