Peet's Coffee,"a very warm welcome as soon as I got into the shop, very friendly associates"
Peet's Coffee,"Peet's on Market & 2nd Street is a long time favorite for me. The interior is dark, roomy, and always clean. The exterior seating is also comfortable and protected by a patio. The customer service staff are always friendly and polite. My favorite item is the chicken chorizo."
Peet's Coffee,Nice coffee shop to hang out with friends. I’m addicted to their brown sugar matcha oat latte.
Peet's Coffee,They didn't get my order right the first time but they did Everything to Make it right. wonderful staff here always good to see a 😊 friendly face in the morning.
Peet's Coffee,"Absolutely love this location, its always consistent from the friendly welcoming service to the cleanliness of the store."
Peet's Coffee,"The coffee is typical Peets--roasted to death--but within the context of an oat milk latte, it is very drinkable.  I like the outdoor seating (will be better once the Market street construction is completed), and the service is pretty topnotch."
Peet's Coffee,No outlets - not a great place to work
Peet's Coffee,"Great Coffee, there's always something to go with PEET'S coffee"
Peet's Coffee,A great cup of coffee with a bakery item and a place to sit down. The three Starbucks we passed on Market street were all for pickup only.
Peet's Coffee,Good place for morning coffee. Friendly service.
Peet's Coffee,"Well it's a Peet's so the coffee is great but I love this location. There's a huge space just outside that you use to take a quiet moment, sit down and enjoy."
Peet's Coffee,Their service is great. Super friend staff make people happy. I love how it's connected to the public open space:)
Peet's Coffee,"The staff is friendly, fast, and welcoming. My friend brought me here a few times before she would go to work, and they want to make sure that their customers leave the cafe satisfied with their order."
Peet's Coffee,"don t look anymore for a great coffe, peet s coffe and tea is the place you have to buy from your coffe, taste goog and not expansive!!"
Peet's Coffee,The coffee is very good and the people on staff are very nice. The decor is also superb. However it is very expensive.
Peet's Coffee,great coffee. though the line can get very long in the morning. I hightly recommend the green tea latte. Its very light but not too sweet!
Peet's Coffee,"Peet's Coffee & Tee was decent. Service was fine and helpful. However, it was very overpriced."

Peet's Coffee,Peet's Coffee & Tea have outstanding coffee & Pastries.  Nice Atmosphere & very clean environment.  It is a good spot to get some afternoon work done. I would highly recommend.
Peet's Coffee,they offer good service and variety of drinks.  i also open or register and have card so every time i go there i don't need to use cash but give them my card.  they also carry cool design container to put grind coffee and tea.
Peet's Coffee,"Service was a little slow but it is still coffee, and good coffee at that."
Peet's Coffee,"Their customer service is very nice, they will greet you very kindly. Their service is fast and quick. they will do any customize drinks."
Peet's Coffee,You walk into a specialty shop and not just your typical coffee shop... won't name any names... Starsomething..  Great service with a smile!
Peet's Coffee,"Nice decorated cafe, employees give customers warm smiles. kind of the competitor of starbucks. but i like peets better"
Peet's Coffee,"Good coffee place, excellent service"
Peet's Coffee,Small shop serving great coffee with prompt casual service. A few tables inside & on sidewalk.
Peet's Coffee,Usual peers goodness but this space is not very efficient.counter takes up most of the space leading to few seats for customers.
Peet's Coffee,My favorite coffee shop. In dire need of a remodel.
Peet's Coffee,Great service and amazing coffee. The baristas are always so nice and recognize regulars.
Peet's Coffee,The coffee is OK but not good. And the advertised wifi is not working
Peet's Coffee,"The service there is really nice and efficient. Even if the line is super long, they get things out pretty quick. Their coffee is really good (way better than Starbucks') and their almond milk is much sweeter and doesn't taste bitter like most. If you haven't tried it yet, go for their Earl Grey Latte (I recommend with almond milk). Also, the staff is pretty attentive. I order a drink with almond milk that usually comes with whipped cream (I didn't know that) and I didn't ask for no whipped cream. The barista noticed it was being made with almond milk and nothing was marked about the whipped cream so he asked ""Hey, do you still want whipped cream"" and didn't just assume I wanted it. That personal touch was really nice. I like Peet's a lot."
Peet's Coffee,"Good coffee and snacks selection, Good location right new MINI station. Good place to get a coffee or snacks."
Peet's Coffee,Really good mocha and friendly staff
Peet's Coffee,Great local coffee place in San Francisco!
Peet's Coffee,"Wonderful aroma, kind service, and quickly served."
Peet's Coffee,A good place for a cup of coffee!
Peet's Coffee,"2 bucks for a coffee, you can't really beat that.  The proximity to my apartment building alone is worth the 2 bucks.  The coffee is pretty standard.  Like I have heard before from coffee enthusiasts, that at a major chain coffee house you are paying for caffeine not necessarily a quality of the coffee.  Which I tend to agree with, but sometimes you want to get something fast and relatively cheap that's going to wake you up, hence why I went to Peet's.  Over all not bad and they are everywhere in the city so access is the best part of this coffee place."
Peet's Coffee,The make it right every time. Excellent service. Very clean.
Peet's Coffee,love getting free coffee with my pound of coffee
Peet's Coffee,Great place for coffee dates as you can bring your drinks (and free WIFi code) into the glass-covered courtyard next door. Peet's Coffee is exemplary and you can easily dial into the WiFi. Impress a business or personal date with your choice of meeting location!
Peet's Coffee,Great dark chocolate orange latte
Peet's Coffee,Nice Peets next to a public open space.
Peet's Coffee,"I used to love Peet's Coffee because I'm all about that strong, bitter jolt in the morning; Peet's really provided that for me. But after years of corporate provided free Peet's coffee, I started to become sensitive to the bitterness of the brew.  Overall, I think the coffee is good once in a while, maybe every other day, but having it as a daily coffee grind could potentially set you up to feel all coffee's are quite mild."
Peet's Coffee,"This was not my first time visiting this Peets location, but this will certainly be my last. My experience here was nothing short of awful. I ordered coffee and did some work for a whole hour there. I meets some friends, talk for a moment and then get up. I was going to shoot some photography of the coffee shop and he burista's making coffee (but generally the overview of coffee shop atmosphere. It was simply for a project. Then one of the women managers there tells me that I can't take pictures in there and I have to delete them, I refuse and tell her that I don't believe a word she saying, when she said that's are policy here. So she told me I had to leave. I've come there many times and I've never been treated I a rude manner, but after this, I believe that woman should be fired. She's not fit to run a good coffee shop, regardless of the fact she was a lesbian. Peets coffee is no where near as good as Blue Bottle Coffee anywhere, plus I can take pictures over there."

Peet's Coffee,A bit dirty but has coffee
Peet's Coffee,Peet's is one of the Best Coffe Shops Out Here In San Francisco. I have to give to them they make a mean Tripple white mocha  im drowling thinking about it. The other little unique thing about peets coffe is that they grind Coffe for you freshly in front of you.
Peet's Coffee,Excellent
Peet's Coffee,Friendly staff. Walter's service goes above and beyond!
Peet's Coffee,The public open space next to it makes a difference.
