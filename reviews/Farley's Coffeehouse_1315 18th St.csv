Farley's Coffeehouse,"I think this is a great neighborhood coffee place. The atmosphere is beautiful, you can see people from the area coming and enjoying their time. The service was friendly, helpful and fast. they offered a variety of drinks and pastries but you can also find souvenirs, magazines, tea, coffee, merchandise and more. The place is very spacious and has a few tables inside and an outdoor area. We order a golden iced kate and one iced chai latte. The drinks were flavorful without being overwhelming.All the right flavors were there, the pastries were also good. The price is on the higher end but I would love to come back since the vibe and product received are worth it."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Amazing atmosphere! Local art on the walls, lots of seating. The baristas were extremely helpful and suggested a truly delish maple latte. A downside is the bathroom that isn't easy access, the building looks very old so that makes sense but A disappointment regardless. there is outside seating and seams like a great place to meet for coffee as well as get a thoughtful little gift. They had SO MANY cool options for making coffee at home, which they also sell by the pound! Highly recommend"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Picked up coffee with a group of friends here recently. The environment is cozy, couple places to sit inside, but generally a pick up and go cafe.  The coffee and empanada were great.  There’s also a lot of merch and gift shop items to browse then you’re in there. They also have a stocked magazine rack for purchasing and browsing."
Farley's Coffeehouse,I really really really love this place. Their honey lavender latte is amazing and I highly recommend it. Their pastries are really great as well. I’ve had their banana bread. They have outdoor and indoor seating. No wifi so that people are more inclined to talk to each other. They also have a magazine rack. Included in this rack they have journals/ art books by locals. I thought that was pretty cool to check out. They also have merchandise to purchase. I really want a sweater before I get back to the east coast tbh. The ambience here is super chill and I really hope you get the chance to check this place out.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Love Farleys. Love their coffee, love their staff. It’s a great neighborhood place. I just feel  it’s ridiculous and so unfair to charge a $1.00 extra for oat milk in my macchiato! I can’t drink regular milk! And oat milk or alternative milk does not cost more than regular milk!!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Farley’s is a gem of a neighborhood spot, with great ambiance, in a lovely location on 18th street! Great coffee and treats. Also, Farley’s hosts local artists, so it is both a great coffee shop and and an intimate gallery space. A place to comfortably linger with a book, computer,  or a friend! Highly recommend!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"I've heard of Farley's, but haven't visited this place since the... 70's?  I met a friend here and now I remember... what a great institution and place!  So glad they're still here!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Got matcha latte & beef empanadas. Super nice staff. Super long line.
Farley's Coffeehouse,Indoor seating: No Outdoor seating: Yes Bathroom: No WiFi: No  First time here and really unhappy with this place. No indoor seating as it looks like it's all merch being sold inside and also no bathroom - they make you walk round 4 blocks to a public bathroom. The latte I got was mostly foam instead of mostly steamed milk which a bit of foam on top. Overall just not impressed and also annoyed. The 2 star is for the outdoor seating is nice and under some cute trees.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Cute little coffee shop in Dogpatch area near my house! Long lines on a Saturday morning around 9 am, and had to wait about 10 min for the coffee.  Good: -Lots of seating - more seating outdoors than indoors but the space is nice indoors so we got a seat there. - I liked my maple latte! It was really tasty and I found it more sweet than others I've had.  Bad: - Just that the wait times were long and it's a more casual place.  Overall a good place to go for a catchup with a friend but probably not the best place to work."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Nice neighborhood coffee shop. The atmosphere is good. The mocha is not that much.
Farley's Coffeehouse,Ordered a hit chocolate and it was decent.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Amazing! Vibe, coffee and people . Picture is from up the street."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Good neighborhood coffee!  Staff are friendly and coffee is delicious. They don’t have indoor seating but they have outdoor patio. So, you can still sit and work while sipping your coffee.  You have to try their Maple Latte, if you are okay with your coffee being a little on sweeter side. Try their zucchini cake - absolutely delicious- flavorful and perfectly moist.  I have been there three times now. However, every time I had to wait for 10 mins or more time for my coffee. It’s super busy during weekends and I have been there only during weekends. Will have to try during weekday!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Awesome cafe. I nearly passed it walking up 18th. Inside I discovered a clean, well lit space. Staff was very friendly and polite. I had a salad and iced latte. I was happy they had glass ware for drinks. There was plenty of seating available, lots of natural light. Food and drink were good. There is WiFi and restroom available. They also have a decent magazine collection if need something to read. Child friendly with a table and chairs for tots as well as a box of toys. If your walking along 18th keep your eyes peeled for red sign with silhouette of a gentleman wearing a bowler hat and a brolley. Go inside and treat yourself."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Cool coffee shop in Potrero Hill but the drink was a bit slow.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Farkey’s   is the best! The staff is great  and the Coffee is the best in the city. Lovely outside area even on crowded days and it’s a relaxing place to spend your time. And the staff is all masked which makes for a wonderful, safe experience!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"We stopped by for some coffee in this neighborhood coffee stop. Really uplifting vibe. I tried chai latte, which is hit or miss in most places. But this one was one of the good chai lattes.  There was live music starting around 11am on Saturday right outside the cafe. Definitely worth a visit on a relaxing weekend morning."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Really like the vibes of this coffeehouse and the staff was friendly and very helpful! Love that they have pastries from Starter bakery in Oakland. It was great to see the neighborhood out supporting this business as there was a lot of activity both inside and outside. Plenty of seating so bring a friend or two ;-)
Farley's Coffeehouse,"If you're looking to do laptop work here, don't.  They have no wifi and usually limit laptop use to 30 minutes. If you want to have a great cup of coffee, have a conversation and/or be a part of a community space: This place is right for you."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"One of the best independent, small coffee shops in all of SF.  Great local crowd, art installations, fun outdoor seating weather permitting.  My go to coffee place in the Bay Area for the past 7 years."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great coffee with amazing baristas. They know how to make a flat white ;) the ambience is chill and they have community tables. I highly recommend
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Farley's is a touch of the 'old San Francisco - a place that feels like home, a true local spot. And...always great coffee, bites and interesting people."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"When I think of a cafe - this is exactly what I have in mind.  It's a place that inspires my imagination and feeds my creativity.  The folks - behind the counter and in front - are lovely, wonderful and engaging.  Not a Starbucks for sure.  No.  This is a very special place and I'm so lucky that I get to spend time here and get some serious work done as well.  Hope to see you there!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Was here waiting for my flight and I ask for a glass of water and they told me they don’t have water that I have to buy their water. 15 minutes later, white man ask for water and they gave it to him no questions ask smh, my color is not good for this place, I have to buy my water. All good tho, I’m going on hawaii vacation and they have to work and get paid minimum. Lol"
Farley's Coffeehouse,They deftly managed a receipt for me when I bought a gift in case I needed to return it. Great coffee as always
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Really great coffee, cool vibes, friendly staff, diverse magazine selection. Only issue is how long the wait times are on peak brunch hours on weekend. Expect to wait 10 min for your coffee. Extra perk of having an adorable outside seating area you can coffee with your pup."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Awesome coffee! The only issue is that they are usually very busy so it's always hard to get a place to sit! Also they have only two plug-points in the entire place. So if you want to get some work done on your laptop just make sure your laptop is fully charged!
Farley's Coffeehouse,"We love Farley's! As avid coffee shop testers of SF, we have tried tons of spots. Nowhere is there a place with as wonderful of a community and as nice of baristas as you will find at Farley's. Make sure to check out the local artists featured all around the store!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Farley's coffeehouse is, thankfully, still around and brewing. This is a classic San Francisco cafe that's like home to locals. Along with delicious coffee and pastries, you can browse the selection of creative DIY products and art for sale or the always interesting magazine collection. Love you Farley's!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Stylish place with great coffee and amazing ambiance. Recommend to visit it!
Farley's Coffeehouse,Very good coffee shop. Cozy and hip cafe. They also have a very impressive selection of magazines. You can check them out while waiting for your coffee.
Farley's Coffeehouse,I sure am tired of paying six to seven bucks for a small coffee and still being asked to tip. Decent mocha tho.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Such a great coffee shop, the team works so hard to make a great experience for you. Just know if you order an iced tea it'll take a bit longer cause they brew it per order. Great food choices as well and such a cozy cafe."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Found it online, checked it out and loved it.!.!.!. Really good coffee and a really cool neighborhood that I hadn't tripped off of until now. Check it out! Great display of Art and a really nice magazine for sale Section. By the way they offered a dark roast drip coffee and a medium roast drip coffee. I had the dark and it was probably the best coffee I've had in San Francisco. No kidding no kidding at all."
Farley's Coffeehouse,The Chai Latte is my go to! Baristas first off are all cool as polar bear toe nails! There’s a great selection of magazines while you wait for your beverage or snack! It’s a fun place to study or catch up on work! One of my fave places to grab a cup of joe in the city! :)
Farley's Coffeehouse,"The cashier kept getting my order wrong, then got upset with me a denied me service after I paid. I have never been discriminated and disrespected in public this way. That guy is way out of line ! I am never buying coffee here or any of my friends."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Love this place! Hadn't been back in five years, just returned to find it the welcoming, friendly, laid back café it's always been. A true home away from home ☺️"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Very nice and quite and friendly place, something that I have been missing in almost all corporate coffee shops like starbucks and etc. Totally recommended."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Welcoming and fast service. Good coffee. Great local spot to relax and get your morning coffee. Free wifi for two hours.
Farley's Coffeehouse,Excellent empanadas with flakey and thin crust. Standard good SF coffee. 😝
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Nice Vibe, good coffee, cool place to bring a book or a laptop to hang out for a bit ~"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Amazing coffee just 1/2 a block from Plow.  While you wait for your table at Plow head over and grab a coffee. The place has got a chill vibe with some excellent coffee!
Farley's Coffeehouse,👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 As a professional project manager I have never been treated or Discriminated by a business in San Francisco until today. This coffee shop will get a complaint to BBB. The attitude and the unprofessionalism from the barista will never be tolerated anywhere.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"First time here and I was not happy.  Restroom: no Wi-Fi: no Power Outlet: no  Just imagine, you are someone who is not from city, you need to charge your phone, rest while drinking some coffee and maybe keep exploring rental places on Zillow while resting..  This place is not for you :)  Couldn’t charge my phone, couldn’t search anything while I was having a coffee.. couldn’t do my business with my laptop either..  Pros: it is cute place, drip coffee is average."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Hello Kadir, Thank you for visiting Farley’s today. I would like to share that we do have a restroom (upstairs to the right). The Baristas would certainly tell you if you had asked. We think we are are very welcoming place and a nice spot to rest and get a feel for the neighborhood. Sorry we don’t have outlets or Wi-Fi but glad you like the place and think the coffee is Ok. We hope you’ll come back again and enjoy the space."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Coffees priced well compared to nearby competition. However consistency lacking. Had beautifully made cappuccinos with generous microfoam and latte art. Then other times my cappuccino has almost no foam (like a flat white) or foam is spooned on with big bubbles.  Farley's has great staff but really needs to up its coffee game when Linea is just around the corner.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Coffee cake was good, but nothing beats their Iced Lattes! I drink 2 or 3 every visit"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"My favorite spot on Potereo Hill. Has racks full of wonderful art, design and political magazines to check out while waiting for your coffee."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great service. We really enjoyed their golden latte - not too sweet!
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Silky smooth mochas, clay indoor/outdoor and views overlooking the city when walking around nearby."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED, my mocha and, far more, the service!!! Can’t wait to come back!!! ❤️❤️❤️"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Grab a sandwich next door and pop in for great coffee, spicy chai, friendly service and relaxed atmosphere"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Almond croissant was delicious
Farley's Coffeehouse,"A very relaxed atmosphere at this cafe. Not as cozy as other cafes, but is a decent place to meet people or sit down for work."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"No Wi-Fi, and they were out of oat milk at 9am on a Monday"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"I want to like this place... grew up here... love the neighborhood and the local vibe. But cripes the baristas were super rude to me! Chatting and on their phones as I'm waiting to order, and then really acting dismissive and mean. Maybe b/c I am older and don't look cool at all. But you shouldn't judge people on how they look! Mean people :("
Farley's Coffeehouse,"I love this place, pretty good coffee. Matcha Latte 10/10."
Farley's Coffeehouse,My girlfriend and I come here almost every weekend for coffee. Friendly staff with great pastries (the vegan donuts are amazing). Nice parklet outside where you can relax and sip your coffee.
Farley's Coffeehouse,Hot chocolate was not hot. I appreciated that wasn't too sweet
Farley's Coffeehouse,One of my absolute favorite coffee shops! It's definitely a neighborhood joint with lots of locals and the staff seem to know everyone. You can sit indoors our outdoors and they have a large selection of magazines to peruse. The coffee is delicious and made with love and they have some great pastry items to eat. Love it here!
Farley's Coffeehouse,"They play great music and have a corner with magazines to purchase. Their pastries are awesome, tea is good. I haven't tried their coffee, but they have a proper espresso machine:) Charming spot with a public outside area. Note though: no outlets to charge your laptops!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Great coffee and easy, fast mobile ordering!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Good coffee, friendly people. At the beginning we asked if they provide hot breakfast, the barista kindly suggested that we can go to the shop next door, they have good hot breakfasts. The recommendation went well, and we came back for Farley's latte after getting our hot sandwiches. The cafe latte from Farley's is nice and overall ambience there is relaxing. We enjoyed our first visit to this shop."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Family coffee so you might get shanked if you go here and like Irish style
Farley's Coffeehouse,I have been going to Farley since I was 9 years old it's not the same but almost it still makes top three places to get a cup of cough in San Francisco a special potato Hill and sit down and pet a dog and enjoy yourself
Farley's Coffeehouse,"This place is fantastic. It has a perfect location in Portrero Hill and based on the sign in the back it has been around since 1989?! The staff is very friendly and quick to recommend an amazing cup of brew. The atmosphere is very relaxed with a lot of people on computers, conversing and laughing; or reading one of the many magazines that they have to offer from off of the back wall. They have a great selection of both those and coffee. Stop in, sit outside on the patio area or enjoy your cup inside on the windy days. :)"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"One of my favorite neighborhood haunts! Great casual environment with friendly staff, great coffee/espresso beverages, and occasional music in the evenings. Good for first dates. Great for a sober location. All around fun :-D"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great almond latte and nice interior
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Wonderful neighborhood coffee shop with an upbeat staff, beautiful decor, and local feel. It's a great spot to do work (wifi expires after 2 hours), people watch, or just chat especially on a sunny day. The food and drinks are yummy and decently priced. Great lighting during the day as well, for those of you looking for that Instagram pic..."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Farley's is one of my frequent go-to coffee shops on the East side of San Francisco. Always fast friendly service. I usually don't indulge in pastries, but there is always a delicious looking variety available. Comfortable surroundings, and decent, two hour free wifi, but seating can sometimes be scarce inside. This place is fairly popular and will sometimes get crowded. At those times, there is extra seating available in the parklet out front. Their hours are reasonably extended compared to most coffee shops for those late evening espresso shots. They also offer a punch card which is honored at both Farley's locations. Always a plus!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Cool spot for coffee. They have a decent amount of seating. The style of the place is eclectic which makes it an even better place to hang out vs a cooke cutter coffee shop. There are also shelves of various types of magazines can one can purchase, I enjoyed just visualizing eyeing the various type of magazines some I'd never heard of."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"3.5/5. Great baked goods, good coffee, expected pricing -- overall slightly over rated.The servers and baristas have the cheer and charisma of a damp plank of wood. Other than the glazed over, uninterested stare you get walking in, the space is quite welcoming."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Nice Portrero Hill coffee shop. Chai latte was decent
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Wonderful service and coffee! I really can't complain about Farley's. The lines are out of hand some mornings and afternoons (for obvious reasons) but they move pretty quick. I love the diversity here. A great place to get some work done, it's family friendly and just inviting all the way around. My neighborhood coffee shop for the last 6 years, just can't go wrong here."
Farley's Coffeehouse,We came for a great night of comedy! The atmosphere is simple yet comfortable. The drinks were delicious. I'm not sure how often they host comedy night but last week's talent was so funny!
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Great neighborhood cafe with a nice laid back vibe. Be warned that their coffee is stronger than it tastes. I always tend to order a second cup and then an hour later, I'm jumping off the walls like a two year old on Redbull. They have a great selection of magazines too. Motorcycle friendly cafe."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Friendly service and delicious coffee.  Great neighborhood spot with a parklet to sit down and enjoy your coffee and small bites. The line can get long during the weekends, but service is usually quick."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"So tasty and what a great atmosphere!! Also, I went during quarantine and I was impressed. They have a huge plastic window between you and their staff. A+ My favorite drink is the cortado with oat milk. 👌👌👌 …"
Farley's Coffeehouse,First time I've had hot chocolate in a glass without handles.  It was kind of hard to drink.  The almond pastry tasted like something mass produced.  The prices are very high for what they offer.  Most of the crowd seemed to be on the wait list from Plow across the street.  I wouldn't go there again.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"This place is nice and trendy and the coffee is good to boot! Portrero Hill is slowly becoming the place to be in San Francisco. It's on the top of the hill with gorgeous views of downtown San Francisco and the bay. So whether you want to grab your coffee, relax inside with one of their wide variety of magazines or grab your drink to go and walk around in the warm weather that's up to you, but the coffee is gooooooooooood here.  Try an iced latte. It packs a punch."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Truly good coffee house and while you are sitting and enjoying your Expresso Latte Farley allows you to thumb through any of their magazines.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Open late, cool art, *very* awesome staff who'll talk to you casually without being overbearing or fake, and most importantly - the coffee is EXCELLENT and cheap. Have been missing joints like this since I moved from the East Coast, where one doesn't have to sacrifice great tasting coffee for atmosphere. My only complaint is a lack of electrical outlets on all but one wall.. and since so many people love to hang around here and work, it can be a challenge to charge your laptop. Bring an extension cord and people will thank you for it!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Great coffee, fun atmosphere, friendly staff. Cozy neighborhood spot fill of local character. Pairs nicely with breakfast from Hazel's Kitchen next door."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Coffee done right! Yummy treats. Grab a magazine or board game at this bustling coffee joint
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Thoroughly delighted by the drip coffee! I brought my own thermos and was able to add Oatly oat milk and chose from an array of sweeteners. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, with many on their laptops or meeting friends. One corner is full of every magazine you can imagine, free to borrow while you stay. I especially love the public parklet out in front for al fresco seating! This is the total package for a coffee shop!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"cute, family owned, historic business in one of the best neighborhoods in the city. the history of this place is unparalleled to any other third-wave shop.  baristas are friendly and outgoing. vegan options. food options (smaller snacks, but Hazels next door, with the ability to eat inside of Farley’s ensures you’ll naught be hungry!) DELICIOUS espresso and pour over options beautiful outdoor patio, one of the best in the city. (guard your laptop, there have been drive-by thefts!)  a true GEM in a city of façades and bourgeois coffee. don’t be that guy/gal sitting on your laptop taking up space with your $3 tea for 12 hours.  oh and most importantly, the bus bin in under the stairs (which lead you to the bathroom!)"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Another one of my favorite spots on the hill, Farley's is more of an institution than a coffee shop. Great place to hang, read magazines or play a board game. Free 2-hour wifi provided. Square payment system, so all credit card accepted."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Friendly. Staff courteous and alert as well as want to meet your requests  music on Wednesday nights. Great wifi. Clean we'll lighted good acoustics. You can hear yourself
Farley's Coffeehouse,"A welcoming and neighborly coffee shop, with lots of natural light, a simple and soothing decor, where you can entertain a quiet conversation while sipping on your caffeine - laced beverage. They also make am exquisite matcha latte. The baristas are expert, fast, and very nice, an added plus!"
Farley's Coffeehouse,A locals favorite. Quality options. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is friendly and remembers you after a while. I would highly recommend pairing their coffee with the sandwich shop next door.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Whenever I go to a coffee place for the first time, I like to feel like I belong there.  The fine and applied arts on the walls, the paints chosen for the walls and the architecture.  Farley's has some steep hills getting to it, but it is worth it in views of the city and the quality of the coffee.  Tara at the counter didn't have an Indonesian to pourover for me, but the Brazilian she recommended as a substitute wasn't too acid and had a deeper apricot and honey flavor to it and was delicious.  I couldn't see the pour but I gave her dazzling smile an earful of adjectives as the place touts itself to be a writer's hangout and she laughed with me and the time was quality for as long as the crowd quickly forming line for coffee cut short.  I hope to talk to her more about brewing things at another time I visit.  I asked her the question ""What does third wave coffee house mean?""  She responded by pointing out it was the subject for discussion later.  They only have two people on at a time, so the line can take some time but it is worth the wait.  My cup was cleaner and more refined a pourover than I have gotten at the two Starbuck's I have reviewed previously.  Next time, we will take in Verve coffee of the famous Santa Cruz clan extraction.  The LC"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Tasty latte. Expect a line if you’re going to be here on a weekend. PB&banana sandwich from the place next door.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"If it weren't for Farley's, I don't think I would have been able to pass my last class in College. Quite literally this calm coffeehouse allowed me to plug in and /work/. The coffee is good, though not to the standard that ""3rd wave"" coffee shops are putting out. The atmosphere trumps the quality of their coffee any day. Games for friends. Also, food is great. It feels like Farley's is a part of the neighborhood, and responds dynamically to its customers, rather than simply offering services."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Spacious (relative to location) with lots of outdoor seating. Quality coffee, good preparation, plenty of food options from indulgent to filling. Neighborhood ambiance combines with great customer service."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Pretty good coffee. Great vibe & friendly staff. You can chill in there to drink your coffee and play the board games they have inside there. I love it when I pick up my coffee and there is a cute design on the cream!
Farley's Coffeehouse,"My latte came quickly and had a nice flower on it. The interior is small, with an open section with magazines for sale. We couldn't find a seat inside, but there's a parklet outside with additional seating."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Farley's is dope - nice cafe and good coffee. (don't let them skimp you on the amount they pour into your mug though, they might try and get away with 1/2 a cup if you don't pay attention!  There's only outlets on the far left (3) tables, so if you plan on sitting around with you laptop for a while, get there early!  My suggestion - Hazel's Kitchen next door for lunch. Chicken pesto melt or the SLAMMIN' BLT.... seriously though"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"I've ordered the soup, it was nice minestrone but served in cold bowl hence the soup hot cold really fast and there was no bread with it, nor was it up sold to me. Staff was mehh ambience alright, good for local spot to just work on a laptop"
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great family friendly local coffee & pastries shop.  The coffee was good and the staff is friendly.  They also have outdoor seating.  Now if only they can freshen up the donuts .... 🙂 …
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Been here several times and finally have an opinion. The coffee is good and the pastries are tasty. The staff, however, could stand to be a little more friendly, or at least try to act less bored."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Check out the Art pieces - love this Café's support for local artists.
Farley's Coffeehouse,Very nice coffeeshop in Potrero Hill! Love the location. If you walk one block up you have a great skyline view. Veeery good coffee with thick milk foam on top. Great magazine selection! And nice outdoor seating!
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Absolutely gorgeous, this local coffee place with breakfast empanadas make you feel, well, like a local. With outside seating and an extensive magazine rack, bring your dog and relax in the San Franciscan sunshine"
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Ahh, the proverbial neighborhood coffee shop complete with wannabe techies on their laptops and headphones, peppered senior citizens debating morals and politics with just a hint of racist cynicism one would expect, and of course the ""Mommy and Me"" rushes. But nevertheless, the staff will remember your name, complete your order with a smile and NOT make you look dumb when they talk about coffee origins and roasting processes. Other goodies: LARGE selection of magazines to peruse and perhaps buy, local baked goods, and outdoor seating (in the shade, usually)."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Lovely neighborhood cafe that hosts numerous community events as well. Beloved by many, it's retro feel and quality offerings make this a standout.  They also have a parklet."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"This place is a Potrero Hill institution.  They host local artists and musicians, carry a great selection of magazines, have an awesome staff and stay open late.  They’re also responsible for an awesome annual 4th of July fireworks show."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"This is going to be unpopular review but, I have to be honest. I lived in for a year Potrero Hill and Farley's is my closest coffee shop. I am currently boycotting them.  I have been in five or six times and only ONCE was I treated well and, that was by the manager. Every other time I've been in, I have been ignored, talked down to, or even mistreated.  Also, I don't really care for the coffee and they only accept cash which is annoying. There it is, for what it's worth."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"This is an amazing place to come with a book, the NYT or your computer. The coffe is delicious and the atmosphere is always nice and inviting. You can seat outside and enjoy the sun and the street."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Extremely nice and pleasant service from the employees.
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great long time local Potrero Hill cafe. Great selection of magazines too. Tasty treats to accompany the barista drinks. Many seating areas inside and out.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"The very definition of a community coffe house!  Great coffee, pastries, and great music outside on the weekends.  Do yourself a solid an check it out."
Farley's Coffeehouse,This place is awesome!!! The workers were so sweet and were so welcoming. Honestly a great place if you’re visiting SF or going to study :) coffee was bomb too.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"The (only?) coffee house in the Potrero Hill's little ""downtown"" area. Tables inside have usually been all taken the times I've stopped by on weekday afternoons. Nearly everyone is there with a laptop. I've been able to squeeze in on a large shared table. Other times I've sat outside while the weather was good. They've got a nice outdoor area in front - a ""parklet"" that occupies the parking space in front. However, there's no power outlet outside.  Street parking is easy to find but most streets nearby have 2 hour limit during the week, daytime. If you need to park longer, try the streets between 16th & 17th."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great coffee and a friendly neighborhood atmosphere.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Pleasant coffee shop. Art on the walls changes monthly. Good espresso, but I liked the old coffee more. Pressed sandwiches are good, but seem a little oily."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"A totally remarkable cup of coffee in a neighborhood-local place.  Free wifi, games, reading material and some classic local flavor as well.  The only reason there isn't 5 stars is because it can get a little loud."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"This is a neighborhood favorite that I was so happy to see is still around, celebrating 30 years on the hill and I hope they see another 30 plus. Great coffee, wonderful art, good company."
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Neat concept. Harken back to the old days where you read magazines in coffee shops. Pre wifi, pre laptops, pre smartphones. But they still make a killer coffee. Their baked goods are also pretty good. Not sure where they get them from, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even their Koign Amann was pretty good. Nothing like B. Patisserie, but still decent from a coffee shop."
Farley's Coffeehouse,Great coffee and their barley mushroom soup was great. The journals in the bookshelf are an interesting read and you can leave your mark in one as well.
Farley's Coffeehouse,"Ordered 2 chocolate chip cookies to go, paid $5.50, got home, and realized there's only one cookie in the bag. I just wanna know if it was a five and a half dollar cookie or if somehow the other cookie went missing... It was a good cookie though I guess *sniff*"
