Alamo Square Cafe,"Got a cappuccino and bagel breakfast here. Nice ambience and medium level of business  on a Sunday morning. I really enjoyed the ambience, the kind barista, and the ability to do work in this cafe. 6 tables and lots of power outlets! However the coffee is not my favorite at all. The coffee tasted like dark roast and reminded me of Starbucks coffee. Maybe that would fit the palette of someone else, but I would come back here to do work or grab a bite, and not for the coffee."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Hi Linda- I disagree with your comparison and so would our loyal clientele, but you’re right in that maybe your palette is drawn to something different.  Thanks for the visit and the kind words about the staff. "
Alamo Square Cafe,"This is a nice, unpretentious small cafe just around the corner from Alamo square. The couple who served us were super friendly and attentive. It's clean and calm inside with limited outside seating. Prices are reasonable for the neighborhood, three dollar coffee, $13.50 sandwiches. Nice place"
Alamo Square Cafe,Tks!
Alamo Square Cafe,"The Lox Bagel was super fresh, soft on the inside, lightly toasted, and warm enough to slightly melt the cream cheese, crispy cucumber, red onion, and fresh tomatoe~ Yummy! The Pumpkin Oat Milk Latte was perfect for enjoying walking through the nearby park on a fall morning."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Mindi!  Hope to see you again real soon."
Alamo Square Cafe,"You’ll walk into this cafe from a trip to or from Alamo square (painted ladies) & think you’re in for normal sandwich/salad/coffee, how wrong you were! The man who served us was an artist of sandwiches, simplicity with effectiveness at a good price! Thank you for the meal today!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Andrew!  Appreciate the wonderful compliments.  "
Alamo Square Cafe,"Unpretentious little cafe serving breakfast, bagels, sandwiches, salad and a large assortment of coffee and teas.  Around the corner from Alamo park and Painted Ladies historical houses. The neighborhood is quiet, hilly and calm - fantastic way to spend a quiet afternoon working on a laptop, free wifi. Good large coffees and polite friendly service.  Really enjoyed it this authentic no frills place."
Alamo Square Cafe,"We stopped at this local corner shop for coffee, breakfast and to keep out of the rain for a bit. I had a garden salad with eggs and ham and my husband had the egg sausage sandwich, both delicious and my salad was huge! The server was friendly and willing to I accommodate my odd egg and salad request. Definitely recommend this place for a light breakfast or lunch and you want it prepared fresh! Also, loved the 90s music they were playing!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Christine!  Glad you enjoyed your experience with us.  We aim to please.  Come visit us again real soon."
Alamo Square Cafe,Cute little coffee shop with delicious sandwiches for lunch.  The staff was very friendly.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it took almost a half an hour for our party of six to get all of our food so the first person was done eating before the last person even got their food.  I would recommend the chicken pesto sandwich!
Alamo Square Cafe,Courtney-thanks for your thoughtful review.  Your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we are certainly listening.  Hope to see you again real soon!
Alamo Square Cafe,The sandwich I had was really great - do give this place a try. Cozy interior and friendly staff. There is some interesting art on the walls that is available for purchase via QR code.
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Will!  Appreciate the kind words."
Alamo Square Cafe,Great breakfast and really nice stuff 💜💙
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Alex!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Absolutely poor customer service. I was made to wait for my order for 40 mins when at least 15 orders after us were already processed (racist???) Upon confronting we were rudely told that we needed to wait if we wanted the food. Poor poor customer service but expectation to be tipped is always high
Alamo Square Cafe,"Oh boy, what can I say, it was Bay to Breakers.  Obviously, you’re going for maximum pain with your (racist???) remark.  That’s a reflection on you and you should probably explore the reason(s) you would post something like this.  "
Alamo Square Cafe,"Great little spot! Stopped here before going to see the painted ladies, the sandwiches were delicious and the coffee was great! Will come again!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Appreciate it Danny!  Looking forward
Alamo Square Cafe,"Great sandwiches, disappointed in the BLT, very thin slice of bacon compared to the grilled chicken and black forest ham. Coffee could use more filtering, coffee grounds in the cup. Overall great spot."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, R."
Alamo Square Cafe,Great mocha! Nice place to rest after seeing painted ladies! Clean restroom for customers.
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Elizabeth!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Vibe is great, but very disappointing coffee. I didn’t try the food but I definitely recommend getting coffee elsewhere."
Alamo Square Cafe,well.. i just bought BLT and latte . First.  latte was pretty decent maybe because i worked at coffee industry for very long time second.  not enough bacon at least that's just me any way!  and i totally forgot to mention light on sauce! overall i like the environment; it's  small and clean place. owner was nice!. only thing is that wish they accept the EBT but it's no problem. i'll definitely go again!
Alamo Square Cafe,Thank you…? 🥴
Alamo Square Cafe,"We stopped by on our first day in town and this little cafe was the perfect pit stop. It’s comfortable and down to earth with simple, tasty food as well. The prices are extremely reasonable and the staff was very friendly. I highly recommend Alamo square cafe if you’re in the area. We’ve already come back on our 1 week trip!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Gracie!  Hope to see you again real soon!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Best coffee in SF. Garden bagel and breakfast sandwich excellent. Service was pleasant. We’ve been here a week and do wish we found it sooner. You must visit !!!!
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Heather!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Must visit for breakfast or lunch… great coffee and delicious sandwiches 💪🏼🤟🏼 …
Alamo Square Cafe,"Tks, Robert!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Absolutely love the cafe!  The staff is really wonderful and caring! We're regulars and love interacting with them!  If you like oatmilk drinks, I recommend their oatmilk cappuccino over the latte. Their pesto chicken sandwich is also really yum! It's also great that they have gluten-free bread, which is a bit hard to find in cafes sometimes.  Highly recommend this cute cafe with great art!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thank you for the kind words, Aakansha!"
Alamo Square Cafe,The Cafe au lay...mind the spelling was decent.  Good place to grab ☕️ before skating..
Alamo Square Cafe,Thanks Juan
Alamo Square Cafe,"Tried to stop by for a quick lunch. A lot of the items pictured are not on the menu, no gluten free bread, etc. probably a fine place to go if you’re a local and know what they offer, but maybe call ahead if you have dietary restrictions."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Can you be more specific about ""a lot of items pictured are not on the menu""? The only thing we're out of is gluten free bread.  I don't know if you're aware, but we're in the middle of transitioning out of a 2-year pandemic that disrupted the global economy including the supply of pretty much everything and anything you can think of.   As a result, we and the rest of the service industry are dealing with challenges in sourcing some of those things we sell and use from vegetables to lids, including, gluten free bread.  As much as we would love that have that available for you, we have zero control as to when that might be the case.  I don’t know what “local guide” means exactly but I would hope that as one, I you’d be more in tune with the state of the restaurant industry at a macro level.  Hope this helps you in understanding and you reconsider your 3 star review. Also our menu is on our website: alamosquarecafe.com"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Needing a boost to help us adjust timezones, we decided to stop by Alamo Square coffee for a pick-me-up before going to the Painted Ladies. The place has a great vibe that's perfect for those who want a warm & friendly neighborhood coffee shop where everyone knows your name and you're treated like a local. Our drinks were ready shorty after ordering so we set out towards Alamo Square. While walking away and sipping my latte, I noticed my order tasted different and assumed they messed it up. It still tasted great for whatever it was so I didn't care and we continued on our way. Suddenly I hear someone shouting my name from behind us and turn to see the lady from the coffee shop literally RUNNING towards us with a new drink in her hands. Even though I messed up and grabbed someone else's drink, they cared enough to run a full city block after us to correct MY mistake. We'll definitely be coming back to Alamo the next time we're the city!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Thanks Joel!  Appreciate the kind words!
Alamo Square Cafe,"Tasty coffee, plenty of seats with outlets and wifi. Ideal cafe to sit down to get some laptop work done.  In a city full of boutiquey cafes... Alamo Square Cafe is a relief."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, R!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Amazing sandwiches at this great little lunch spot. Highly recommend, especially if you are looking somewhere to eat when visiting the pink ladies."
Alamo Square Cafe,Hi Eric!  Thanks for the compliments!  Hope you’re back soon.
Alamo Square Cafe,"Awesome service, great food/drinks (best matcha in town in my opinion), and immaculate vibes. The art is always intriguing and changes with the seasons and holidays. Wonderful spot to develop community and cozy up with their mini library! ❤️"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks for the kind words, Andrea!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Gorgeous sandwiches full of filling (Pesto Chicken unreal!) - really friendly service & of course great coffee !
Alamo Square Cafe,Thanks for the wonderful review.  This is why we why we do. Visit us again real soon!
Alamo Square Cafe,Perfect local coffee shop. Plenty of charging spots.
Alamo Square Cafe,A small and cozy Cafe. Very nice staff!! :-) The sandwich tastes very delicious !!!
Alamo Square Cafe,Hi 2ba- Thanks for the kind words and your splendid review!  Until next time. -ASC
Alamo Square Cafe,Such a quaint place. Coffee and breakfast sandwiches are delicious. We grabbed our stuff and walked to the park to enjoy on the grass.
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Nelly!  Hope to see you gain real soon!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"This coffee shop is a great place to sit down and study. They have wifi, they have great coffee, and they have the cafe setup such that it's easy to sit down and answer a few emails. I had a breakfast bagel and it was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. This cafe sits in a unique location, too, sitting at the opposite end of Alamo Square Park from the famous row of houses dubbed The Painted Ladies. The cafe has a small selection of very interesting books for patrons to browse.  Food: 7/10 Drinks (coffee): 9/10 Environment: 9/10 Staff: 7/10"
Alamo Square Cafe,Thanks for your review.  You should try one of our sandwiches next time and see  if we can get that food rating bumped up!
Alamo Square Cafe,Best neighborhood coffee shop in all of Alamo Square! The wonderful owner is just a delight to see when you enter the Cafe and the coffee and food she serves is just the best! I highly recommend if you're in the area to stop by and check out the best place to support a local business for your best coffee sandwich and bagel experience! 🥰😍🥰
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Kary!  Our community rocks!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Our other local breakfast hang while we stayed in SF last month. Real nice coffee shop atmosphere and not super busy, so easy to get a table.The owner is really nice and friendly. Coffee was really good and the menu, while limited (bagels!) was certainly fit for purpose."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Hi Andrew, Thanks for your feedback.  Your opinion is very important to us, and we pride ourselves in our service, so thank you for noticing.  Hope to see you again real soon! Sincerely- ASC"
Alamo Square Cafe,Sandwich is pretty good. Also like their latte. Great place for getting brunch for a picnic by the Painted Ladies park.
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, SP!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"I happened to come across this cozy little coffee shop quite accidentally. To my surprise, it had everything I wanted - Good food, hot coffee and Internet connection. The variety of bagels that Alamo Square Cafe offers is fascinating. I especially liked the ones with peanut butter! Yum! They also offer a good variety of sandwiches and salads with sides. There are also a select amount of cookies and fruits available. I love the cute look the cafe has - the blackboard with the menu being written colorful chalks gives the cafe a pretty look. The place is conveniently located near the Painted ladies, one can get a coffee here and walk to the park in front of Painted Ladies and enjoy the view :-)  I am giving a 3 star rating for Alamo Square Cafe :-)"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Really cute and cozy cafe for a quick afternoon lunch. We were short on time, so swung by here and gave it a shot. The staff was very quick and food was delicious! We shared the tuna fish sandwich, and had the hummus platter and a mango smoothie. the tuna fish was perfect for lunch for us. The hummus platter had hummus, pita bread, and dolmas, which were all delicious! Our mango smoothie was super refreshing too!  Seating may be tight if the cafe is filled with people working on their laptops, but definitely a nice place to grab a quick lunch, maybe even get it to go and enjoy it at Alamo Square Park! Dogs are also welcomed inside too!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"If you're not a white person, don't expect any sort of customer service. The short man behind the cash register brought out food for the white couple sitting outside but left ours inside several times despite us sitting right next to them outside. Wouldn't recommend spending your hard earned at a place that's so blatantly discriminatory."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Wow!  Don’t really know how to respond to this, but as the owner of the establishment and a minority myself, I feel a little a bit offended by your comments, I’m at least 5’8!.  All I have to say is, you sir couldn’t be any more wrong.  Happy holidays to you and yours!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"I recommend this coffee with all my heart. They make great avocado toast. Many varieties of tea, very rich coffee and unbeatable attention. If you want something different for breakfast, come here!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Lucia!  We appreciate your kind words."
Alamo Square Cafe,"This is the best coffee & sandwich place you will ever visit. The sandwiches are just sooo delicious, SO good. Great atmosphere and the couple and who run the cafe are so nice, warm, friendly and generous! Pop in and try it, you'll never go anywhere again!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks for sharing, Shelley!   Hope you visit us again real soon!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"We loved this place! In the hustle and bustle of the crazy city we were lucky to find this little gem just around the corner from the house we rented while in town. The coffee is delicious and the pastries are even better. Friendly staff, remembered my order daily. I will miss this little place and if I am ever back we will for sure drop in."
Alamo Square Cafe,Love this place when I'm near Alamo Square. I always stop in to grab something. Perfect spot to grab a pre park coffee. Super friendly staff who make you feel like part of the neighborhood even though you're not :).
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Jarret!  Looking forward to your next visit."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Place is cosy and quiet, so it's good for working or reading. Decoration, design are not particularly remarkable but the bagels are quit good and not expensive.  One more cafe option in SF, worth a try if you are around."
Alamo Square Cafe,"We stumbling upon this place while on our way to see the painted ladies. The food is amazing here we had bagels and coffee, why can’t we have this Quailty back home in Australia. If you are going to see painted lady’s I suggest stopping here to grab a little bit, would give this 10 stars if I could"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks for the wonderful review, Luke!  Maybe someday we’ll open in Australia.  But for now, you’ll have to visit us again!   Looking forward to your next visit."
Alamo Square Cafe,Lovely quiet and historic neighborhood- awesome latte and cafe shows beautiful art of local artists- enjoy!
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Cathleen!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Very basic breakfast menu with bagels, breakfast sandwiches, muffins & assorted pastries.  Everything is made to order so it may take a few before your breakfast is in hand, but it will be done as you requested."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Thanks, Thomas!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"Chai latte is good, Breakfast bagel is good, Turkey sandwich was good. Wifi was a little spotty. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Alamo Square Cafe,Quick and tasty combined with the perfect service. They provide a good variety of dishes for breakfast and snack combined with a good cup of coffee or chocolate (I especially like that!!). Definitely worth a stop!

We take pride in it and make it a priority. On behalf of everyone at Alamo Square Cafe, we sincerely thank you!  Come visit us again soon!"
Alamo Square Cafe,"A nice little coffee shop on Fillmore and Hayes. Across the street is Walden House, a rehab. Check it out. The building was used as City Hall after the old one was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. A nice tree with a bench under is outside and a liquor store is nearby. Stop here for a cup of coffee before you head to Alamo Square and admire the Painted Ladies and absentmindedly hum the theme song for TV show ""Full House."""
Alamo Square Cafe,The best bagel i have tried & good coffee…fantastic service!!!.it s a MUST…!!!!😍 Carmen & Manuel …

Alamo Square Cafe,"While the barista was very nice and the cafe was cute, the iced coffee I ordered was so bitter I just dumped it out a block away. It was undrinkable."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Hi Andrew,  thanks for the visit.  I’m sorry that you didn’t find our Iced Coffee to your liking.   We take pride in our iced coffee and our customers praise us for having “real” good iced coffee.  So it surprises me to hear you say otherwise.  Sometimes if you’re used to a certain place that might have filtered iced coffee you may not always get that real coffee taste or you maybe be getting watered down coffee somewhere else.  Our iced coffee is made from the same batches our hot coffee is made from.  Anyway, again, I’m sorry you didn’t have a positive experience. If you visit us again, your next drink is on us."
Alamo Square Cafe,"Best cafe in sf, very homey and everything is made with love. 10/10 recommend"
Alamo Square Cafe,Thanks!

Alamo Square Cafe,Very bad experience .The waitress is really really impolite. Run away
Alamo Square Cafe,Hi Moise - Some context would help us a long way in addressing your grievance.  I should point out that your original review was reported and removed because of foul language. That makes it difficult for me to give you the benefit of the doubt and determine who was the “impolite” one here.
Alamo Square Cafe,"Great service, great coffee and affordable could use a bit more color but overall good experience service with a smile as well"

Alamo Square Cafe,"During my stay in SF it was where I went to have breakfast every day. It is the typical Cafe Bar of the American series, average prices and with vegan options. In my case I ordered: Avocado toast with gluten-free bread and coffee with soy milk. It cost me about €15 and the toasts have been the best I've eaten in my entire life. 100% recommended, hyper nice staff."

Alamo Square Cafe,"During the week that I stayed in San Francisco, since I was staying two blocks away, I went every day for breakfast. The site is very cosy. The food is very good and they have a wide variety both for breakfast and to eat a sandwich. My favorite is the avocado toast, I recommend it 100%. I really wanted to try the muffins, especially the chocolate one, it looked great!"
Alamo Square Cafe,Great breakfast and at an affordable price in San Francisco! And just down the street from the Painted Ladies! The BLT Bagels and Avocado Toasts are great!  Great breakfast at an affordable price in San Francisco! And just down the street from the Painted Ladies! BLT Bagels and great avocado toast!
Alamo Square Cafe,"Alberto, Thank you for the great review. Until next time!"
