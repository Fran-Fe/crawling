Dolores Park Cafe,"Can't beat the location! Loved bringing my dog to Dolores Park and can definitely see us eating at this cafe again. Got the Egg sandwich (it was just as pretty as the pictures! ) and the Pastrami on Rye. Both were good. Also got a chai latte because it was freezing outside, but next time would definitely opt for their smoothies and juices since they sound fun and delicious. Overall, a great find and nice spot to hang out with friends and your dog."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hello Darlene. We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your experience at Dolores Park Café. The Dolores Park Egg Sandwich is definitely a guest favorite. We look forward to seeing you and your dog many more times. Don't be a stranger.
Dolores Park Cafe,I found this super cute cafe near the park. I ordered a drip coffee. I waited like 10 minutes and I was so confused why it was taking so long. Apparently they completely forgot about my coffee. If I didn't say something I would have waited all day. Lol!
Dolores Park Cafe,Hello Xavier we apologize this happened. The cafe can get very busy and at times orders can get lost in translation. In the future please let the manager know we are more than happy to make it right for you. We hope you'll come back and give us another try! 
Dolores Park Cafe,Went to this coffee shop for the very first time. Absolutely amazing coffee and great customer service. Most definitely will return. Employee who assisted us was Eli or Elijah.
Dolores Park Cafe,"My review is strictly about the coffee. IF YOU ARE THE TYPE THAT LIKES THE NEW LIGHT ROAST THEN THIS IS YOUR PLACE. I am not so convinced🤔 I prefer dark roast espresso similar to the Nespresso or what you would get in Italy, France or Switzerland, for example. Light roast coffee has a more acidic or fruity note and taste which just doesn't agree with me. If you are mixing your expresso into your frappuccino then it probably won't make much of a difference for you. Double espresso with a splash of soy, $4.20 But if you like to just sip a single or double expresso exactly the way it is then you have to consider all of this. Dark vs. Light...."
Dolores Park Cafe,Ghidossi thank you for your review. We also roast a medium-dark roast in house. We like to give the customers the option of the light citrusy style which is more tea like and smooth or the medium-dark roast which is more chocolately with a silky finish. Our espresso is award winning is more like the italian flavor profiles and speaks for itself! Thanks again
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cute and homey coffeeshop with WiFi and outdoor seating right on the park. Great place to spend an afternoon with a friend, a book or a laptop. I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Neil, thank you for the 5 star review! Our breakfast burrito is huge and popular item on our breakfast menu including brunch! Free wifi with orders, outdoor seating by the Dolores Park with a great view to people watch. You're the best!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Beautiful and across the park from café. Enjoy, relax, and people watch."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hey T, thanks so much for the 5 stars! "
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great place for breakfast. Friendly staff, quick service and good variety. Everything we had was delicious: Homemade granola, French Toast, Dolores Egg Sandwich and Lox Scramble. Highly recommended!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Yay. We slayed! Thank you so much for visiting Dolores Park Cafe, we're so glad to have provided a memorable dining experience."
Dolores Park Cafe,"SF DISCLAIMER: it's expensive go figure  I will come back for the regular grilled cheese sandwich because it's probably alright!  At the recommendation, I had the *special* grilled cheese with a tomato bisque. It was good, but I suppose I prefer my grilled cheese to be just that... bread with cheese. No veggies or meat mucking things up!  Service nice; vibes cool."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hi Brian. Thank you for your visit. It is unfortunate to hear that you felt the prices of our menu items high in San Francisco. We use the highest quality ingredients and pay fair wages for our staff. Even so, we are priced at or below other top food spots in the area. We look forward to serving you again sometime soon and look forward to having you back for a plain grilled cheese with chips!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Breakfast burrito while small was delish. As a whole this spot is expensive without a lot to show for it. Been here forever for good reason but now IMHO it skews more towards having a menu rich with items lending to good margins for the operator/ owner. Convenient across the st from the park/ Bi rite
Dolores Park Cafe,"Mocha with soy - OK taste, good price. Wifi - 👍 Bright space with lots of seating inside and out - 👍 Variety of food on menu - 👍 Chill music - 👍 Plug to charge devices🔌- only one behind the fridge.  Good place to pull out the laptop to get some work done, catchup with a friend,  or chill with a book and people watch.  Visited on July 4 at 10.15 am."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Amazingly delicious and fresh sandwiches and a wonderful view of the park and street corner. I got a special chicken sandwich, the bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside to compliment the sauteed mushrooms, chicken, juicy tomato and more. Seriously healthy and fresh food."
Dolores Park Cafe,Was really disappointed with my experience considering the reviews here. My food was great but my Golden Latte was lazily made and tasted of turmeric and milk. The staff were also very unhappy. It was a very busy day but it seems this place cracks under pressure. 4/5.
Dolores Park Cafe,Thank you for visiting Dolores Park Cafe. We strive to provide our guests with an exceptional dining experience and we're sorry to hear we missed the mark during your recent visit.
Dolores Park Cafe,Nice place by Dolores park. Had a vegan breakfast burrito and oat cappuccino. No complaints. I vaguely recall being disappointed as one of menu items I wanted was not available though.
Dolores Park Cafe,We're thrilled you enjoyed your dining experience at Dolores Park Cafe. Please come back and visit us again soon.
Dolores Park Cafe,Good food. Good vibe. Can’t beat the location!
Dolores Park Cafe,Eric thank you for the 5 stars! We totally like to Vibe and our food is super fresh and made to order. Dolores Park is a great location and we've been Vibe'n for 27 years strong! See you soon
Dolores Park Cafe,"Good coffee and good location! This cafe is right next to Dolores Park. However, they don’t have outlet to charge your laptop so I would not recommend if you want to work/study there.  EDIT: I later asked them about the outlet locations and was told that there is only one outlet, which is not in the main sitting area."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hello Seguy thank you for the review. DPC has a few outlets for computers. Please the manager or another team member in the future for outlet locations. Thank you!
Dolores Park Cafe,Great Thai tea and yummy grilled  cheese. Very quick service we got our order in like 5 minutes. It has a lovely view to Dolores park.
Dolores Park Cafe,We're so glad you enjoyed our Thai Iced Tea and Grilled Cheese. Please come back and visit us again soon.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Has so much potential. Everything looks like it should be great, but turns out to be… just ok.  Parkside location is unbeatable and menu selection is expansive. It would be 5/5 if they just improved the food quality a bit.  I live 1 block away and never go because I know foods going to meh."
Dolores Park Cafe,"We're saddend to hear that our food did not make you smile. Rest assured, your feedback has been passed along to our Chef to help us improve future dining experiences."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Amazingly tasty and fresh sandwiches and a stunning view of the street corner and park. I got a special chicken sandwich, the bread on the outside was perfectly crunchy and on the inside soft to complement the saute mushrooms, ham, juicy tomato and more. Very new, balanced food."
Dolores Park Cafe,Perfect location and spot in Dolores park to grab your quick sandwich. Have gluten free bread! Friendly staff.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Yay. We slayed! Thank you so much for visiting Dolores Park Cafe, we're so glad to have provided a memorable dining experience."
Dolores Park Cafe,"This cafe survives solely by being the only place to grab a drink or snack on the same block as Dolores Park. The coffee is bitter and often burnt, the pastries and donuts are alright but even for SF standards, ridiculously priced for the quality, and the lattes are poorly made as well. I’ve tried it numerous times in good faith trying to give it another shot but it just isn’t good."
Dolores Park Cafe,Austin we are sorry to hear that you did not have the experience you hoped for. Please let the manager know in the future if you are coffee is not up taste as we have multiple flavors and are happy to exchange it. Our donuts are vegan made by Local Donut Farm and our most popular pastry. We realize there is always room for improvement and different tastes and hope that you will try another flavor in the future! Our espresso and coffee drinks are 3rd wave coffee and not often the Starbucks method. We roast in house and froth our drinks with coffee art. We hope that you'll give us another try and we thank you for the feedback so that we may better improve in the future
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cool place for meeting, with cool things going on around, lots of people playing sports and enjoying the day in the park, but my friend had a break into his car, so be careful with that. Didn't try the food, next time."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hey Andre thank you for the nice review. We recommend trying the Breakfast Sandwich next time you’re in!
Dolores Park Cafe,Beautiful perfect location. However they can do better with lattes. A latte is not supposed to have frothy milk.
Dolores Park Cafe,Shweta we are sorry that you had this experience. Our coffee program is part of the 3rd wave movement. We roast our espresso beans and the milk is frothed to be super creamy on top often with latte art designs. We don't use the Starbuk method of having the top of the latte watery and bubbly. In the future please let the manager know and they are happy to make the latte to your liking. We hope that you will give us another try. 
Dolores Park Cafe,"Honestly I have nothing to say about the quality of my Americano. The Vegan Nutter Butter was absolutely delicious.  My problem was with the service.  I came in around 4pm an it was pretty quiet, I ordered a triple shot Americano and asked if they had brownies and I was told no, but that they did suggest trying a Nutter Butter (delicious).  I was asked if the order was for here or to go and I explained that I would like it to go because I was waiting for a Lyft.  I sat down and waited for my beverage as the cashier then went on to chat with their coworker. I assumed they were not the barista so I just waited. Eventually I just noticed nothing was happening so I got up and asked how long for my food and drink.  Cashier: ""What are you waiting on?"" Me: ""Triple shot Americano and a Nutter Butter""  The cashier makes the Americano and serves it for dine in and walks away.  So I grab their attention again.  Cashier: ""Did you want something?” Me: ""I also ordered a Nutter Butter, oh, and this [Americano] was to-go""  They put my drink in a to-go cup and hand me the Nutter Butter and I leave.  What should have been at max a 5 minute interaction was over 15. I paid almost $13 after tip for this.  I will not be back."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cute café with beautiful views onto Dolores Park and the façade of the high school. The coffee was good, the croissant was delicious, and it looks like the donuts are to die for—though I resisted."
Dolores Park Cafe,J.L.F.Thanks so much. We promise that our insanely amazing delicious donuts are just what you need! Our croissants are big and fluffy with just the right about of crunch and as always our coffee is roasted in house!
Dolores Park Cafe,"WAY overpriced--what you see (pastrami sandwich, comes with chips) is over $15😂🙄 Tasted good, but I can get a bigger, better tasting, and $5 cheaper of the same type of sandwich at a few other places in the city.  Huge disappointment. …"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Been there twice for breakfast, great and healthy food, nice view on Dolores Park and friendly service."
Dolores Park Cafe,"It's a scam. San Francisco is #%^*ing expensive, but this place is a a scam - smoothies mostly water an ice, bowls you'd expect in a high school cafeteria.  There's a reason it's at the park and still half empty - be warned."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hello Paul. We are so sorry to hear about your experience at DPC. Our smoothies are not made with any water. They are made with fresh fruit that we squeeze in house alongside fresh ingredients. Ice cubes are put in the smoothies. If you would like it to be thicker our staff is more than happy to make one with extra thickness similar to to those places that use frozen fruit. At DPC we deliver the freshest smoothie and fresh pressed juices made to order. We hope that will give us another try and look forward to having you in the future.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great option right next to Dolores Park (hence the name) and with expanded outside options, it’s even better! I was pleasantly surprised to find it easy to get a table on a perfect Saturday afternoon.  Weather is great, food all looks delicious and there are plenty of alcohol and beer options."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Austin, great name! Thanks so much for the great review!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Fresh albacore tuna sandwich was amazing everything fresh and you could taste the wonderful tomatoes and crunchy pickles. The staff is friendly wonderful and very helpful.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Food is overpriced but, marginally, better than average. Very slow service cancels out any hope that the high prices are worth it. Waited 30+ minutes for a kid's hotdog, mac and cheese, PB&J and breakfast burrito...on a Monday. 35 minutes to be exact..."
Dolores Park Cafe,"H Chris, we are very sorry that you had to wait. In the future you can ask them to put a rush on it as it is a holiday and the kitchen is small with an enormous amount of orders to fulfill. When it is busy the wait time can be a bit longer. Please reach out to us personally at dana@parkcafegroup.com. Please let us now what time you were in so that we can better serve the issue. Again, our apologies."
Dolores Park Cafe,"One of my absolute favourites for a filling and healthy breakfast (or brunch) in Dolores Park. Tried a few options so far and overnight oats, veggie scrumble, turkey avocado sandwich and the cold press juices are great. Efficient service, clean and nice big window overlooking the park. It’s not cheap but worth it!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Atmosphere: great. beautiful views, great natural lighting, all-age friendly and spacious.  Location: perfect! Easy to find and within close proximity to public transport.  Food: limited plant-based / allergen-friendly items. While they can sub things out, don’t have a robust selection of full dishes which qualify.  They also charge extra for plant-based milks which means they get a few stars knocked off."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hello Shelly and thank you for taking the time out to review us. We gather you are looking for plant based foods and we do our best to accommodate every appetite. We are working on more vegan and gluten free items this summer so hang tight. We have many insanely delicious pastries that are both vegan and gluten free. Regarding sandwich subs our items our include potatoes, salads, soup (often gf) and chips as we are a salad and sandwich cafe. We do suggest Gracias Madre and Ananda Fuara if you are looking for a space that is geared strictly towards a plant based lifestyle. They are both fantastic. We do charge extra for plant based ""milks"" as our costs are much higher than dairy. We hope you will give us another try in the future! Our best to you--"
Dolores Park Cafe,"This is my first time here, and based on my lunch I will be returning. It's nothing spectacular, just a good, solid cafe. My Spicy Tuna Melt, which came with kettle-style potato chips, was tasty. The iced tea is good.  The space is simple, with tasteful music that is set loud enough to add atmosphere but not so loud as to make conversation difficult. And the huge windows are great."
Dolores Park Cafe,Thank you for the feedback Alaina!
Dolores Park Cafe,A trendy and social environment in the Mission with the right noise level for socializing. The coffee and food met my expectations. Nice view of the park as well.
Dolores Park Cafe,Ellen thank you for taking the time out for the stellar review. We give you 5 stars
Dolores Park Cafe,"I was visiting SF from NY for my 21st b-day and this place was such a comfortable place to be to eat alone (and I've never done that before in a public setting) . I ordered the Italian pesto sandwich and a lemonade and it was AMAZING , quite literally my dream sandwich accompanied by delicious lemonade !"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Gabrielle, thank you for the compliment! Dolores Park Cafe is the neighborhood cafe known for it's great art shown by local artists, our Italian pesto is known for it's fresh flavors, and of course our lemonade is made in house. Thanks so much for the wonderful review and hope you will visit us again. Happy Birthday!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Had just coffee and it was very good!!! :)
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cristina! Thank you so much for reviewing us with 5 stars. Our coffee is made fresh daily, we roast our beans on site at Precita Park Cafe and offer two varieties for different tastes. Thanks again!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Good vegan options including donuts. Very clean.
Dolores Park Cafe,We're thrilled you enjoyed your meal at Dolores Park Cafe. We strive to create a delicious dining experience and appreciate your review.
Dolores Park Cafe,"I love this place, they have sense of humor ( ""this restroom is for customers and unicorns only"" 🤣)and a good food which fair priced. Also they provide fresh, cold water for free. …"
Dolores Park Cafe,Fluffy French toast with a nice drip coffee. Also can’t beat the vibe and the view of the Mission Dolores park.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Thai Iced Tea 95/💯!  Dolores Egg Sandwich 🥪 96/💯. \n  It's been a great #coffeeweek  🤝☕🙂 for me, and Thai Tea is a great substitute for when you're over-caffeinated btw. You can drink it here 😁 in a quiet setting with nice staff members! \n  Being in the same neighborhood as cool startup-y people is fun. And while it's tempting to allude more specifically whoever I may or may not have met this week, I've learned that discretion is the name of the game in #SF #SV... I used my  🧠 and my  📱  to understand this. \n  (disclosure: no relationship whatsoever with DPC, not even a loyalty member)"
Dolores Park Cafe,Hey P.E.  you P. E.  we all P. E. You're the best!
Dolores Park Cafe,"Fantastic food. A little pricey, especially for juice drinks, and can get busy, so plan on being early or eating to-go."
Dolores Park Cafe,"I’ve had brunch here with friends 4-5 times and it’s been great every time.  Especially perfect for eating outdoors on days with nice weather.  I love the lox scramble, mimosas, and cocktails.  After filling up on food and drinks it’s lovely to go lay around the park, chill out, and digest.  I’ll definitely be back!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Spear thanks so much for the great review!
Dolores Park Cafe,LOVED my avo toast. Adorbs place with very nice staff. Obviously the location is great too.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great place to socialize, scenic views by the park. Pleasant service."
Dolores Park Cafe,Thanks for the shout out Jon!
Dolores Park Cafe,Really good coffee and an almond croissant that left me wanting more. Very reasonably priced too. Service with a smile. What's not to like.
Dolores Park Cafe,"So, so bummed that they took the Thai bagel off the menu!! It was my favorite item and the reason I always went to this cafe for brunch 😭😭😭 I would give a 1 star for the menu change.  Otherwise still tasty, great coffee, nice employees. Can't fault for that 💕"
Dolores Park Cafe,Saskia unfortunately we had to make changes to the menu where items were not selling. The Thai bagel was amongst them. We’ve added new fun new items and invite you to take a look.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Awesome location, great staff, meh food.  We live nearby and really want DPC to be amazing; sadly it’s solidly “meh” in terms of food.  The best items we’ve found: - egg sandwich (great homemade English muffin) - kale smoothie  Most everything else we’ve tried is average to below-average. But we’ll keep coming back to keep the hope alive…"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hello David, thank you for your feedback. We will be getting together with our team and kitchen staff regarding your review. We hope that you will give us another try and please reach out to dana@parkcafegroup.com for further review and outreach. Thank you"
Dolores Park Cafe,Food was good and everyone there was nice except Nicole. She called a random name instead of mine and then yelled at me when I didn't reply (to a name that wasn't mine..?) :( and gave me the wrong food and then blamed me. She's also very rude to her coworkers I feel bad for them all because they all seemed nice. If she's going to yell at customers who tipped her she should not wear a necklace with her name on it. But yeah the food was good and so was every other employee!
Dolores Park Cafe,"They told me w a full confidence that churros do never come w chocolate, such an inflated attitude. And there was somebody's lipstick on my friend's cup"
Dolores Park Cafe,IIlya we are sorry to hear that you had this experience. Please reach out to dana@parkcafegroup with more information as this is not the standard we set for both our staff and our customers. Our apologies
Dolores Park Cafe,"Good Cafe, good coffee. Nice park adjacent. Street kids smoking pot up there were harmless."
Dolores Park Cafe,"I've only been to Dolores Park Cafe a few times, but it's always bright and friendly (the space and the staff). Add coffee and a great oudoor section and what's not to like? Take a stroll through the park before orafter - or before AND after."
Dolores Park Cafe,Chris DPC gives you 5 stars for being you! Thanks for the informative review
Dolores Park Cafe,"Beautifully arranged establishment in a beautiful spot. Food has been great every time with veggie and vegan options. Substantial menu selection with a mostly accommodating staff. Though sometimes when the lines get long they can get focused and a little chaotic, like most places. Highly recommended for a slow relaxing day when you aren't in a hurry and have time to take in the scenery."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Love this joint. Amazing location, friendly service and yummy bites.  Tad pricey for breakfast but it's well made and served.  Worth it for a seat to read and visit so close to the park."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Bryce, we love you BIG time. Thank you for giving us 5 stars. Eat local, neighborhood cafe, fresh, breakfast, so delicious and by Dolores Park. What more could you ask for? xo"
Dolores Park Cafe,"It's a vibe, mostly great because of the central location. If you ask for modifications to your green smoothie they can make it happen. I did get some unblended ice chunks though."
Dolores Park Cafe,"This is actually a nice place to eat.  They make great sandwiches, but two things makes me give them 2 stars.  One is their bathroom is often out of order.   I have been there theee times without the use of bathrooms.   If they serve food, they need to make sure the bathroom works.   Two, . Many transients visit this place, crazy scary people.    This is not their fault, but It is not uncommon to see a filthy guys grabbing some milk from the counter or walking into the cafe to find food."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Doris, thank you for the insight. We will look into your post and do our best to make improvements. On a side note we do not turn away customers because of economic disparities or demographic but will make sure that  all customers are not handling condiments during statewide mandates. Our apologies"
Dolores Park Cafe,Great place for snacks and coffee. Also when it’s not busy I like doing office work here
Dolores Park Cafe,"I just ate here for my first time and it was incredible. I had The Standard breakfast sandwich and it was amazing- open-face with perfect scrambled eggs, melted cheddar cheese and bacon strips- perfection. The coffee is from Equator which is my favorite brand, the latte I had was great. Every employee was gracious, warm and friendly- I'm so hooked already. GO!!!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Victor, we love you, we love you, we really love you. Thank you for the great review"
Dolores Park Cafe,Had this delightful Vanilla Coffee had this Cafe.  Can´t get coffee as good as this in Iceland
Dolores Park Cafe,"Thanks Jonas, we train our baristas monthly and us local roasters to give you the best cup of love in town!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"I ordered the granola and yogurt, expecting a mediocre, small cup of mostly yogurt and sub-par granola and fruit for more money than it was worth. I was so pleasantly surprised. The serving was not only a very gracious portion that was suitable to be an entire meal, but it was so fresh and delicious. There were mango cubes, sliced banana, and strawberries atop a beautiful and delicious homemade granola, surrounded by yogurt. My friends ordered egg dishes, and while they were good, we all agreed that I won the best breakfast! I only wish I had taken a photo, but it was so delicious that I’d go out of my way to return if I visit the city again!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Dana, we aim to please and thank you for taking the time out to review us in addition to giving us 5 stars! We love healthy, fresh, fast, and you!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great place to eat and people watch. Free Wifi that was easy to get on. Outdoor seating and seating inside with great windows and nice light. I ordered a Beet Salad. Perfect and simple. Huge chunks of beets, fresh delicious greens. Love this place!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Kathleen thank you for taking the time out to give us such a stellar 5 star review at DPC!
Dolores Park Cafe,"Good food, good friendly service, GREAT location. You can't get much better than sitting next to one of the best parks in San Francisco while drinking a latte and reading a good book on a sunny day. Unless of course you were enjoying a glass of wine instead.  This place is centrally located in the heart of the Mission and worth a stop in."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hi Kevin thank you for taking the time out to review us. Let us know what we can do to get 5 stars out of you as we seem to be headed that way!
Dolores Park Cafe,Our waitress was the best. Steve Miller Chgo
Dolores Park Cafe,Hey Steve! Thanks so much for the shout out!
Dolores Park Cafe,"The food selection is good here. The location is awesome. The service is pretty good. It's cramped inside if it's busy, but the outside seating is nice if the weather is good. I suppose it would be nice to sit at the bar seats as well, but the tables inside feel very busy and cramped, especially if there's a long line at the cash register. That whole area feels a bit cramped though. I picture the line across the street at BiRight creamery which I have never stood in. Makes me want to run out into the park and enjoy the space."
Dolores Park Cafe,"My friends and I came for brunch here and we really enjoyed it. The french toast was absolutely delicious. While the chairs are not the comfiest, the staff is really nice and it makes the experience worth it. It's a good place to stop by and pick up some food to take to eat at Dolores Park, which is located right across the street."
Dolores Park Cafe,"We loved this little cafe across from Dolores Park. I have read other comments that the prices were high but I wonder what they are comparing the prices with.  The fresh pressed juice prices are similar to what I’ve paid elsewhere on East and West coasts.  Other prices are similar to elsewhere in San Francisco.  Ingredients are high quality, cafe gives back to the community and is quaint, comfortable and on a great little corner across from the  Dolores Park.  Outdoor seating too!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hi Mom of3 Scholars, thank you for recognizing the quality and pricing of our food and drinks. We do use high end products, everything is made fresh and we take great pride in our products. We do feel as though are prices are equivalent if not lower than most of the high end places throughout San Francisco. We look forward to having you back sooner than later! Please reach out to me as I would like the opportunity to thank you personally. dana@parkcafegroup.com   Thank you"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Comfortable, casual coffee house directly across from Dolores Park.  They have a nice mix of cafe classics, coffee house favs and healthy options.  I had a great pick-me-up of fresh squeezed juice (beet & ginger) and shot of espresso.  The crowd here is really laid back and friendly.  There's a decent amount of seating inside and out.  We liked the counter help - friendly, funny and quick!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Besides it's location next to Dolores Park, I think this place is a little overrated. Their food is good, but it's a pretty limited menu.  And, they have a lot of rules - no laptops at certain tables or at certain times and there was something about the bathroom. They get so much foot traffic through here that they just want to serve as many people as possible.  They don't seem to be looking to create a loyal local crowd."
Dolores Park Cafe,The outdoor patio seating and the large open windows with view of Dolores park and the high school get it 4 stars alone. Pretty pricey but that’s what you get for going to an upscale cafe on the corner of Dolores park. Pretty solid beer and wine selection as well for a post tennis or park beverage if you didn’t bring your own booze of choice to the park already.
Dolores Park Cafe,"They got my order wrong in a few different ways, but service was great and they made the wrong right quick and easy. Coffee was super good and seating was perfect for a quick lunch outside."
Dolores Park Cafe,Christine we apologize for the confusion and glad we were able to make it right quickly. Thank you for your review
Dolores Park Cafe,"Such a friendly place! This cafe is right next to Dolores Park which is one of our favorite places to hang out in SF. They menu has lots of options, all of which are good, and the staff is always amazingly friendly."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Love this Cafe! Across the street from Dolores Park makes it quite convenient. Food is good, reasonable prices, indoor & outdoor seating (great people watching), all sorts of drinks available, I could go on! Check it out if you've never been - it's a great place!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Delicious coffee, nice Spanish music and friendly young staff"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Daniel, thank you for giving us 5 stars! Our coffee is local, roasted on premises at our sister location, our music vibe is eclectic and our staff are super friendly! We hope to see you again"
Dolores Park Cafe,The Panini sandwiches were good but the lemonade was too watered down. Cute cafe across from Dolores Park.
Dolores Park Cafe,I frequent this cafe several times a week because it's in my neighborhood. The food is very good. I love the staff! They have always been very friendly and helpful. I have mobility issues and they have always been kind enough to accommodate me.
Dolores Park Cafe,Tikhon thank you for taking the time out for great review. xo
Dolores Park Cafe,"Extensive organic menu and delicious, healthy and fresh food. They provide farmed chicken, ham, bacon and beef. Eggs they use are cage-free. Dolores Breakfast Sandwich was super good. There are assorted juices, coffees, teas, and healthy brunch options for customers."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Grabbed coffee here many a morning and always enjoy it. Though I've never tried, the food always looks amazing and judging by all the happy customers must be worth the wait. Lots of Gluten Free options on the sweet front too."
Dolores Park Cafe,Loved outdoor/indoor sunny spaces. The food coffee's we're diverse and delicious.
Dolores Park Cafe,One of the most delicious and healthiest sandwiches ever !
Dolores Park Cafe,"Krishna, you're a star!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"This is a great neighborhood spot, with live music, a good happy hour and tasty food.  Dolores Park Cafe is the only place in the neighborhood I've found with a great bagel sandwich that can sate this former New Yorker and I was pleasantly surprised the first time I swapped the bagel out for a baguette, winner!  I always kind of snicker to myself on weekend mornings when I walk past all the people waiting in line at Tartine, grab my delicious breakfast at Dolores Park Cafe and head back home, seeing the same people still waiting in line."
Dolores Park Cafe,Nice location and very busy on Saturdays. Parking is the usual kind of hell for this area. The food definately made up for it. The portions aren't really big but the food is all organic. The veggie scrambe was delicious so we their cobb salad.  Definately worth a visit if you're in the area.
Dolores Park Cafe,Ilan thank you so much for writing a great review for DPC and reviewing us with 5 stars!
Dolores Park Cafe,The menu is inclusive of all diets. The servings are generous and tasty. The atmosphere is always exciting to be part of when dining here.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great food, drinks and love.y staff! It’s right across from Mission Dolores Park. Get it to go and sit in the park!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"I eat here almost every morning while waiting for my shuttle to work. Food is really good, staff is extremely friendly and helpful, overall a great environment to start my day. They make a damn good lox bagel."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Definitely a nice place to get a grab to eat and something to drink. I like the smoothies they have here, tastes fresh everytime. And it's right there close to the park so it's def a good place to go when you're planning on going to the park."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great little coffee place / diner right next to Dolores Park - I usually get my Espresso fix there early in the morning and they do a fantastic, consistent job every day. It's uneventful and not as hipster as some might like it in this neighborhood but this makes me like them even more for it. Make sure to try their muffins if you can."
Dolores Park Cafe,"This is the most 3 star I could ever make a review - it's right down the middle on everything - quality, price, atmosphere ... everything. If their location wasn't down-right incredible, they wouldn't survive, but when you're looking for a sandwich that will leave you satiated, at prices that aren't cheap but won't break the bank, this place is good."
Dolores Park Cafe,"One of my favorite places for delicious cafe food. Entered near ten, it was not crowded. I had a cousin come into town and she asked me to go back here. It has a good interior."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hey Terrence thanks so much for 5 star review!
Dolores Park Cafe,The beet salad was ok. I added chicken. Rather expensive.
Dolores Park Cafe,Hi Ninane thank you for the review. Our salads are organic when possible and our chicken is hormone free. Our prices can often reflect our fresher and healthier product. We appreciate your feedback as we know there is always room for improvement.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Excellant food, healthy portions, and all at a good price. I received way more food than expected with the breakfast burrito. The potatoes had a good flavor and the location was very inviting."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Good selections for breakfast.   I like the bagel deluxe. Coffee served mugs, which is what I prefer.   Plenty of table and counter seating.   One of my favorites in Dolores Park neighborhood."
Dolores Park Cafe,"There are three of the 'Park Cafe's' around the city and each one is absolutely fantastic. The food is of good quality, the atmosphere is beyond pleasant, the WiFi signal is strong, etc. It is always pleasant to visit and spend time. They serve Sight glass Coffee. I just wish they used Square so I wouldn't have to carry around receipts. It sits across the street from Bi-Rite Creamery so I often meetup with a friend to grab ice cream and sit in Dolores Park Cafe with coffee."
Dolores Park Cafe,"This place is awesome - during the world cup, they would often have bottomless mimosas.  They also have a big selection of stuff, smoothies, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good and fairly priced."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great location and tasty food, but overpriced for the portion sizes. The pesto scramble was basically 2 eggs, a thin slice of bread and a bite of watermelon for $13, and I was still hungry afterwards."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cute cafe with a good section of salads and sandwiches. They also make custom smoothies. Vibe is clean, organic, and local. Tends to be very busy on weekends! They also have s sister location near by at Dubose Park."
Dolores Park Cafe,"bakery was good, but coffee was very lacking. everything tasted watery and off putting. not worth it."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hi Connor, we are sorry you that experience at DPC. We tested the coffee after receiving your review. We offer two types of coffee roasted inhouse and fresh. A medium bodied organic washed Ethiopian and a med.-dark Costa Rican bean. We did not find them watery but understand that there is always room for improvement. We hope that you will give us another try and please let the manager know in the future. She is happy to make a fresh cup for you. Thank you"
Dolores Park Cafe,"I'm a huuuuge coffee drinker. I used to work as a barista when I was in uni for 4 years. So I'm obsessed with coffee. I went here today for a regular coffee and a double espresso for my mother in law.....the coffee was bitter. I couldn't even finish it. My mother in law asked me where I got the coffee cause she didn't like her espresso either. You would think that a place that charges so much would have quality coffee. I don't mind paying, but atleast give me something I'll enjoy.  Don't go there for just coffee. I hear the food is good!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"I was in the area and needed to grab a cup of coffee.  It's a bit confusing when we walked in because I didn't see a menu any where.  The menu is set on the wall to the left, while the register is to the right.  All we can see is a list of bagel selections.  The place is clean and pretty quiet when we were there.  The air smelled of bacon which is a big plus."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Gorgeous views, absolutely the best spot for funday Sunday in the park. There is an adorable coffee shop across the street, fun shopping and restaurants just a few blocks down and a busy but friendly daily conglomerate of people, kids, and dogs."
Dolores Park Cafe,Great pastrami on rye. Although I would've enjoyed a little more sauerkraut. Service was very good also
Dolores Park Cafe,"ridiculous and annoying that they close the bathrooms for customers: this policy is just stupid and anticustomer service. never again!  Answering your reply: unfortunately thats not accurated with the reality, neither with what I was told at the restaurant (very unfortunate by the way!). See below: - There are many homeless and you try to avoid them come to your restaurant and use the bathrooms so you close them for everybody. -  It wasnt one person’s mistake from your staff, at least 4 people were hearing my complaining and they confirmed the fact. - The bathroom was not in maintenance ;) - If the problem is the high number of visitors during the weekend then close the terrace, the kitchen, the restaurant....such a bad excuse! The restaurant is open to make profit, customers should at least be able to use the ammenities, not just paying the bill ;) is that fair? - The restaurant was everything but full, I was the only person at the cashpoint and the only one who asked to use the bathrooms. So? - Easy solution: give the bathroom key to the customers who ask for it so they can use it. Problem fixed, isnt this fair and easy? - Even I insisted nobody helped me: terrible customer service, as poor as your answer. Better to apologize and find a better solution instead keep using terrible excuses  Thanks"
Dolores Park Cafe,Hi Alex we are so sorry that you had this experience at DPC. We do not close the restrooms to paying customers.  We do have to close or restroom throughout the day for maintenance as we experience a lot of overflow from the 25k people that visit Dolores Park on the weekends. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope that will give us another try.
Dolores Park Cafe,Good place to enjoy the Mission Dolores Park!
Dolores Park Cafe,Turkey avocado bacon sandwich was phenomenal!! Grilled cheese was delicious as well. Awesome 1st experience. Will definitely be back.
Dolores Park Cafe,"The Damage: $30-40 for two  Neighborhood corner cafe that opens early, usually frequented by the nearby residents. We liked the Standard sandwich and their smoothies  ~~TRY😍: // Pear Smoothie // The Standard  ~~OKAY🙂: // Veggie Scramble  Follow us at IG: eatsmorefun"
Dolores Park Cafe,"I really like this cafe. Bright and spacious, they serve an assortment of cafe amenities like coffee, pastries, and juice, as well as dinner and breakfast. They have an amazing egg n cheese sandwich which you gotta try!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"A few years ago on a sunday afternoon, my family came to visit me from Guatemala and I decided to take them to this cafe a few streets down from my neighborhood. My family found a good table.  I was in line ready to order, talking and laughing with my father about old times, when we were told by a staff member to keep our voices down. We complied despite it being lunchtime and a crowd of people were chatting with beers in their hands. My father quietly walked toward  the bulletin board while I stayed in line when the same staff member began to yell and scream at the top of her lungs that my father could not wait in line to use the bathroom. My father used the bathroom in my home before we arrived so I was a little confused. The staff member was irrate and hostile and boldly put her hands on my father who is in his 60s and forced him to go outside. The rest of my family was in shock as my father was absolutely humiliated in front of them. When i began to speak up about the matter i was met with having the police called on my family for TRESPASSING!!!  She had a huge grin on her face as she said this. We left.  Not only have i never returned to this cafe, I also try to avoid walking near it while on my way to work. You will mever see mee step foot in this establishment ever again."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hello Edward we are very sorry about this incident several years ago. As a significant amount of time has passed regarding his incident unfortunately it is not something we can address with our current staff or look into . We do not have a police report on the incident mentioned. We hope that you will give us another opportunity as you can see the majority of our reviews are 4 and 5 stars.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Really busy and buzzing cafe. Had a K2 smoothie and a chicken sandwich, both were pretty yummy. Nice place to get some respite from the warm weather and people watch. Not the place to be if you are seeking for peace and quiet."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Early cold morning. Sunrise. Chai tea, skim milk. Neither were charred by carelessness. Hot, but drinkable. Big warm glass to wrap my cold fingers around. Daily special chorizo burrito is delicious. The eggs aren't overcooked and the pico is fresh. The people in service are genuine. What a pleasure to start my day this way in the City."
Dolores Park Cafe,Thanks Brian for taking the time out to review us with 5 stars! xo
Dolores Park Cafe,A little expensive but really good red eye chocolate smoothie. I wish it was thicker and creamier. Clean bathrooms.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cute little cafe with food, soft drinks and alcohol. Right across from the park so great to grab something and head to the park. Sage spritzer was delicious!"
Dolores Park Cafe,I'm surprised that everyone isn't ranting and raving about this place. If you're looking for a lighter breakfast but healthy and filling then this is definitely the place to be in Mission. I wouldn't recommend driving at all but it's worth the walk.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Everything they have is absolutely delicious,  really affordable and the staff is more than awesome I highly recommend checking them out if you're in the area 👍 …"
Dolores Park Cafe,"8.04 for a dirty Chai that was finished by the same person that took My order in less than a minute (literally counted back the 96 cents) ,  tasted like cinnamon and a dash of lukewarm milk on top of a drip coffee ... have been here a dozen times or so and always nearly good or not at all."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Joseph, we are very sorry to hear this as we make our chai from scratch and have a coffee program. It sounds like we need to retrain a few folks. You're feedback is important to us and we hope that you will give us another try. We have forwarded this to our management team. Again, our apologies as this is not the standard that we hold for ourselves and our customers."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Nice atmosphere, nice drinks. Food looked good but we didn't eat here. The service was very nice. Nice view of Dolores park too"
Dolores Park Cafe,Great location 👍 fun and fresh atmosphere! Perfect meet up spot. Delicious food! And the best green smoothie I've ever had! …
Dolores Park Cafe,Chaundel thank you for the 4 star rating for DPC!!
Dolores Park Cafe,"An awesome place to chill and meet new people! It's also fairly clean and the grass is well maintained. There's street parking around the area, but don't expect to find a spot right away."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Line is slow moving.  Seating area is noisy and too public. Juice was like 10 oz., too small for the price.  I got up to refill my hot water and another patron was taking my chair after only a minute.  Really congested."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hi Kevin- Unfortunately on the weekends wait times and long lines are protocol for such a busy time. In the future if someone takes your let the manager know and we are i happy to let them the know the seat is taken. Our juices are made fresh to order.  Thank you
Dolores Park Cafe,Unfortunately missed a trip to Alcatraz booked weeks ago. Food was on the counter for 30 mins resulted in the food being very cold! Heard good things about the restaurant went out of our way to eat there left very disappointed!
Dolores Park Cafe,"The location is great and the service is good. Usually a line on weekends, it seems. If you're at Dolores park and want to use a clean bathroom, you can stop by here and buy something cheap :P"
Dolores Park Cafe,The curry chicken salad was decent. My friend said her breakfast burrito and Thai tea were good.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Very nice location, sunny, cheerful, full of light, just facing the park. Great outdoor seating in the summer.  A little bit overpriced. Pastries are nothing special."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Horrible place!!! My girlfriend and I are visiting from NYC, we came into the shop early in the morning purchase a smoothie,  sat at a table to use the Internet.  I was tired and decided to lay my head while my partner finishes what she is doing.  I wake up to the manager Carlos,  engaged in a convo, yelling to call the cops because I was sleeping.  My girlfriend is African American, and here is Carlos which never once came by as a human to talk us ...but was fast to act like a racist with threats of cops. Why were we never approach in a humane manner?  What did we do for you to think it's ok to treat people line criminals?  Carlos you are racist! !worst experience I've had in a restaurant ever racist racist racist! !!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hi Giovanny I am sorry you had this experience. We spoke to our manager and shift leaders. Generally we have a policy after every 3 hours we ask that you purchase something to use the wifi for such an extended period of time. We do not mind customers putting their heads down on a table to rest but we do ask that you do not sleep in the cafe as a resting place. We welcome everyone at our cafe to enjoy the food, drinks and atmosphere."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Across the street from Dolores and bi rite ice cream. Friendly communal atmosphere with local art. Healthy smoothies, juices, salads, and sandwiches! Kid friendly with high chairs and changing table"
Dolores Park Cafe,Xo
Dolores Park Cafe,"A taste of the SF life; great for people and dog watching. Sunny front patio, inspiring view of Dolores.  Sport your hipster shades and a journal, you'll like the new you."
Dolores Park Cafe,Is love going to save the day for this guy? You can feed and water the dogs... ...did anyone feed this guy? Is this just a phase?
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hi Jennifer,  ""Unfortunately the Bay Area has one of the largest and least sheltered homeless populations in the country with several homeless encampments around Dolores Park. Although one of the most prosperous regions in the world, every night thousands of people sleep on our streets. It is deeply dehumanizing to live on the street, and it’s deeply disheartening for everyone to live amid such despair. The social compact that undergirds the function of our cities has been broken.  To some, the Bay Area’s inability to solve homelessness demonstrates the failure of our progressive urbanism — a sign of our unwillingness to enforce standards of behavior on the street — along with our failed housing policy. To others, it is a symptom of a broader breakdown of American society — an expression of deep dislocations in the economy and the extremely high rates of drug use in the United States, along with a sense of despair among large swaths of the population.""  We at Dolores Park Cafe care deeply about this problem. Because we know that we cannot solve this issue at hand please know that we do care deeply. We not only participate in many yearly functions raising money for several organizations, help organize food drives, for several years we have also adopted a person living on the streets that has become a friend that we provide weekly meals to. If interested in helping us with greater outreach please contact us privately. All the best--"
Dolores Park Cafe,Love that place! Great location! Next to Dolores Park (great SF skyline view from the top). Outdoor seating. Amazing pesto sandwiches and very good coffee!
Dolores Park Cafe,Great neighborhood cafe across from Dolores park. Everything on the menu is delicious. I usually order their curry chicken sandwich. Try one of their smoothies.
Dolores Park Cafe,"I came in here on a day I lost my car keys. Zack at the cafe was super helpful, allowed me to charge my phone (which was dead when I walked in) using his charger and also let me use his phone as well to make a few calls so I could get help! Thank you Zack and everyone else at the cafe!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Cosy, friendly, relaxing. Excellent food and juices. I know they have life music as well, but I did not see any during the few days spent in San Francisco."
Dolores Park Cafe,"The food and coffee are pretty average, but the place is crowded on weekends and lunch hour mainly because it's in front of the Dolores Park.  You can grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view.  There are some small tables inside and outside, but chances are that you'll have to share the comunal table."
Dolores Park Cafe,Location location location. Solid restaurant for a day at the park. A large menu with a bit of everything. Food is good convenience is great.
Dolores Park Cafe,Got a freshly juiced OJ and delicious chicken pesto sandwich. Friendly staff. Great spot to people-watch and enjoy some good food.
Dolores Park Cafe,Erich we have nothing but love for you
Dolores Park Cafe,"Good coffee and nice smoothies. They had some issues with the WiFi, and refused to acknowledge that it was something on their end, which was a bit disappointing (we were there with 6 devices in total, unable to connect)."
Dolores Park Cafe,HI Job- We apologize for the wifi being spotty. At times the wifi can go down but it seems to be working fine at this time. Please let the manager know in the future and we can reset it as well. Thank you for the feedback
Dolores Park Cafe,"Yummy place to buy something to go and eat it in Dolores park, in front of the cafe. Great sandwiches and salads"
Dolores Park Cafe,Location and not too much else. The baked goods were store bought. I didn't get coffee there so can't say. Great service.
Dolores Park Cafe,Hi Sumeet than you for your review. Our pastries come from local bakeries in the Bay Area as we support and work alongside our Bay Area businesses. We roast our coffee on site at Precita Park Cafe and welcome you to give it a try sometime! Thank you
Dolores Park Cafe,"Visiting from Phx and we made this our breakfast spot right away. The servings are big, food came hot and delicious to our table quickly, and the service is friendly."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great food for a cafe. Right on the corner of Dolores Park, it's got a great view and people are generally in that area to have a good time so it tends to be an upbeat place to hang out."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Nice little spot next to the park. The coffee isn't the best I've ever had, but it's a good place to bring your laptop and get a little studying done."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for $6.95. Was hoping for a slice of tomato, little salad or something. Got nothing other than 2 small slices of bread with cheese in between and a few chips. Seems deficient compared to other places."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Terrible service. We spent over $80 on food and were told that the bathroom was “out of order”.... while waiting for our food I watched 3 of their employees use said bathroom. Don’t care what you do or what industry you’re in, you don’t blatantly lie to your patrons."
Dolores Park Cafe,They are so quick! My orange juice was freshly fresh and pulpy. My friend loved his Thai iced tea
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great location and the food is pretty good.  Great young, urban atmosphere.  Lead singer from third eye blind ate breakfast at the table behind us!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Nice Cafe on 18th and Dolores. Had a non-fat latte and chocolate chip cookie. They were both satisfying!!
Dolores Park Cafe,I like to go here for sandwiches before sitting in the park. The staff is super fun and very quick with to go orders. I would recommend the tuna melt!
Dolores Park Cafe,"Don't overlook Happy Hour, when you can enjoy that beer for less sitting in the sunny warmth and relaxing after relaxing at Dolores Park. Spoiler alert: you might spot hipsters."
Dolores Park Cafe,"How can anyone justify $11 for lettuce and cheese?  To respond to the owner, it was a ""salad."" Which I suppose is technically true."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hello Henry, we do not have any sandwiches with just lettuce and cheese. Please let us know what sandwich you ordered so that we may better accommodate your review. Thank you"
Dolores Park Cafe,Great had the Chaufa de mariscos which is easily enough for 2 people but pretty expensive for 1. Also had the yucca which was cooked perfectly.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Very eclectic cafe, with organic products. People watching is great whilst you sip a nice cup of coffee. Delicious pastries!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great place to grab a healthy snack or meal before heading to the park. Juices, smoothies, salads, GF bread, and organics are part of their menu."
Dolores Park Cafe,Thank you for the great review Nicky!
Dolores Park Cafe,"I came here last summer - loved the blonde cashier, Clovis! She was extremely polite and sweet!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"If you are looking for a good brunch with a view, the Dolors Park Cafe is made for you. Their smoothies are excellent!"
Dolores Park Cafe,Guilhem thank you for the 5 star review. We love the cafe and love your review!
Dolores Park Cafe,"A neighborhood institution. I love this place. The food is decent, the waitstaff are warm and efficient, it has that ineffable quality of ""home""."
Dolores Park Cafe,Good breakfast..nice vegan choises..good outdoor people watching spot on the #33 bus line
Dolores Park Cafe,Everything was great. All the food was fresh and came out quick. Little pricey but hey its SF
Dolores Park Cafe,"A member of the staff was unbelievably rude and aggressive. I don’t see the need of making my dining experience such a bad one, definitely not going back."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hello Lior, we are so sorry that this happened to you. Can you provide more information regarding your experience so that we may better address the situation."
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great place for people watching, and enjoying the beauty that is the city: Diverse and eclectic mix of people enjoying one another's company. A must do in SF!"
Dolores Park Cafe,A nice little cafe right on the corner next to Dolores park. Lots of open windows so you can catch lots of sun or sit outside on those nice summer days.
Dolores Park Cafe,Thanks Ry!
Dolores Park Cafe,"What part of '' can you put the espresso directly into the cup? '' they don't understand. If just for espresso, skip that place"
Dolores Park Cafe,The breakfast burrito was pretty good but the ham and cheese croissant looked like a bologna sandwich from elementary school
Dolores Park Cafe,Oh my goodness Amber. This is unacceptable and I hope that you will accept our apology and allow us to offer you another one made the Park Cafe way. We obviously need to retrain a few staff members and have reached out to management. We hope that you will give us another try. Thank you
Dolores Park Cafe,Veggie Scramble is a winner. Comes with potatoes (which are alright) and toast. I'd eat there though. The to-go containers aren't great and there's a different container per type of food.
Dolores Park Cafe,Benjamin! You rock and you're a rockstar! Thank you for reviewing us. FYI we are looking into other containers for food deliveries.
Dolores Park Cafe,Great coffee and vibe with superb views of Dolores Mission Park
Dolores Park Cafe,Thanks Greg!
Dolores Park Cafe,If I designed the perfect breakfast burrito it would be exactly what I ordered at Dolores Park Cafe. A+ highly recommend
Dolores Park Cafe,Cute place. Pretty good coffee. Nice view. Nice art on the back wall. I like the bar seating.
Dolores Park Cafe,Nice women but they didnt listen to how I wanted my coffee so now it's more like tea. But the place is cool.
Dolores Park Cafe,Please do something to diminish the line for the single bathroom.  It took me longer in line than to eat my wonderful breakfast burrito.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Hi Sean there are an estimated 300,000 visitors that come to Dolores Park on the weekend. We are as very small business across the street. We encourage park visitors to use the restrooms provided by Park Services."
Dolores Park Cafe,One of my favorite breakfast places in the entire US!
Dolores Park Cafe,"Val, your're the best! Thanks so much for the Superstar words"
Dolores Park Cafe,Good location and nice indoor+outdoor seating with a variety of options.

Dolores Park Cafe,"Andrea, thank you for the great review and taking the time out to give us 5 stars!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Pricey, but their egg sandwich on house made English muffin is really tastey!"
Dolores Park Cafe,"Been going here for 20+ years. Somewhat pricy, but the light is great."
Dolores Park Cafe,Hey Mike thanks so much for the review. Unfortunately living in the Bay Area and during pandemic times we've had to adjust our menu and rising costs. It's a domino effect that starts with our farmers and vendors that we purchase from. The food chain is being hit hard during these times. Please note that we do serve the highest quality and healthiest products and will never waver.
Dolores Park Cafe,Great espresso. Great place to have coffee xoxo
Dolores Park Cafe,"Great place for brunch, with good outdoor seating, a view of the park, and quickly access to Bi Rite for dessert!"

Dolores Park Cafe,Good customer service. Clean and good food.
Dolores Park Cafe,Great breakfast burrito and awesome French toast - 5 points based on that as 3.7 as average is definitely too low
Dolores Park Cafe,Very nice place. It is a good spot if you wanna grab and go to sit in the park

Dolores Park Cafe,Thanks Sam for the great review! xx
Dolores Park Cafe,"Amazing location , great food ... but just so rude disrespectful staff even towards regulars and locals (like myself ) . Worst ppl ever"
Dolores Park Cafe,Hi Miki we are sorry you did not have a good experience at DPC. We do ask that when using the restroom it is reserved for customers as we are across the street from the park and simply cannot accommodate all the park attendees in our small establishment. We hope you will try something delicious and sparkly  at DPC when visiting our great city in the future.
Dolores Park Cafe,Their veggie breakfast burritos are top notch. I also like their Chai Latte.
Dolores Park Cafe,"Food is OK with reasonable price, coffee is OK. Lovely view of dolores park is a plus."

Dolores Park Cafe,"Walking on the road to Hoa Ma, I saw the shop so I went to see how it was! The first impression is that the restaurant is very spacious, the decoration is also quite ok. Check in the file is quite good! There were few people on the road, so it was empty when I went to the shop, there was only 1 table with my table being 2! I ordered matcha and jasmine milk tea! Milk tea doesn't say what needs to be said is my matcha cup! When ordering, the staff asked me if I had more ice cream, I replied that sometimes I didn't see any ice cream, I asked and gave the receipt to coldly went to pick it up and brought out a cup in which there was an ice cream like that! Attitude makes me quite uncomfortable! Drinks are pretty good too, but the staff isn't!"
