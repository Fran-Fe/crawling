Tu Kim Coffee Shop,"Don’t pay attention to the bad reviews here. Good banh mi for $6 each. Cash only. The only banh mi spot in the Tenderloin I’ve seen put on egg. There’s no menu and the workers are a bit straightforward, so walk in and be direct"
Tu Kim Coffee Shop,"This was wonderful - straight up the best Vietnamese coffee I’ve ever had; it’s rich and intense, bitterness rounded off by just enough sweetness to be smooth without being cloying. Banh mi was good too, simple mix of cold cuts and pate. One of the counter staff speaks English and anyway there’s a menu now that you can point to, so the other reviews are outdated. Cosy place."
Tu Kim Coffee Shop,"I had the porridge (asked for no meat) and Vietnamese coffee (iced). Both were incredibly good, especially with the spicy/citrusy kick for the porridge.  As another review mentioned, there's no menu, it's cash only, and it wasn't clear who worked there at first (a lot of local uncles and aunties hanging around, which I really enjoyed). The Vietnamese live music shows playing on the TV was also a great vibe.  The woman-owner who served us was straightforward and a bit short-tempered, but she seems to be a total softie (she smiled so genuinely when I told her how good the porridge was) and we later bonded over her tie-dye crocs.  I would come here regularly if I could! Best porridge I've had in SF."
Tu Kim Coffee Shop,Vietnamese neighborhood cafe serving bitter and sweet cafe sua and bahn mi. Fat footprint gentrifiers  please go ruin someplace else and leave this quiet island free from the blend stab of your crass voices and funny butts in yoga pants.
Tu Kim Coffee Shop,Love the Cháo Lòng and Bánh Canh here. The owners are nice. Price is fair. Place is clean and cozy. Can dine inside now.
