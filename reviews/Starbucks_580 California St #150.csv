Starbucks,"This Starbucks has got a face list, with Target coming right next door. This is in a really prime location, being close to Mascone Center where lot conferences happen in San Francisco. Store looks very modern now. Service is good as usual."
Starbucks,Extremely rude service. Girl with the red hair got her bun too tight on her head or something cause she had a big attitude. I would literally walk 2 miles to a different location than ever have to get served by these people again. Is this a high school club or a Starbucks girl like cmon?
Starbucks,"Hello, I'm sorry to hear about this but appreciate you for sharing your experience. If you'd like additional assistance from our team, please get in touch through our Contact Us page (https://sbux.co/3uW8Bbs)!"
Starbucks,Not the greatest experience but even more disappointing that I find as I pack to fly home all the espresso beans I bought yesterday on 22nd Apr are out of date.
Starbucks,"Lovely crew here @, Starbucks in Target Central. My vanilla cream cold brew was perfect and the atmosphere was positive and warm. 😊 …"
Starbucks,This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations only because its conveniently located inside my favorite Target location!! They also have awesome customer service and make bomb a** drinks. If you want to try something new that tastes so good get a 'mango dragon fruit lemonade starbucks refresher'!! Its one of the best iv ever had...so delicious 😍😛👍
Starbucks,"They don’t care about their customers! No restrooms provided and you will be treated as a thug, no matter what. Below zero stars for this location. Shame on Starbucks for giving the representing their brand. Disgusting!!!"
Starbucks,I just got a coffee there hoping for the flavor i usually get at Starbucks. But seriously I wasted my $3.05. Not much but it is very disappointing when you go for something that you usually know it is good and you get worst product ever.
Starbucks,Coffee was normal. Pastry was good.
Starbucks,"The coffee was good, and so was the sandwich. I would've given 5 stars if I didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes for the sandwich; that I might add, was the only sandwich ordered during the entire time. However, I do want to thank ""the Barrister"" for acting quickly to resolve the issue."
Starbucks,Welcome Back And We Missed You
Starbucks,Hello! Thanks for taking the time to share this review. We appreciate you and look forward to having you back!
Starbucks,"This Starbucks is Amazing! It is totally unique and the coffee is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. I can't say enough good things about the cozy environment and...  Wait, who am I fooling here. It's a Starbucks by the convention center. Why are you even reading a review about it?"
Starbucks,"Used to love this place but they have now started putting less meat in their sandwiches, bread has been over toasted aka burnt and less flavor. Sadly I won't be returning."
Starbucks,Extremely slow service and their hot white mocha tasted like basic coffee with too much milk in it. Had to wait for 30 minutes to get our order and there were only 4 people ahead us. We also noticed people upset because their orders were wrong or they forgot their food. I would highly recommend going across the street to the other Starbucks.
Starbucks,"When I was confused about amounts of espresso in a drink, Tommy was very kind and made it the way I thought it was going to be (not the way it's normally made + I hadn't specified otherwise), while juggling different orders of food to reheat and drinks to make. I really appreciated his kindness & it made my day, because I got to give the other coffee away - Tommy helped make two people's day :-) It's a busy Starbucks that I believe is understaffed, never saw more than 2 people doing drinks and 2 doing cashier (which may be ok, however at lowest I saw just 2 staff members switching between cashier & drinks when line would be 4-10 people long), which is a result of management & it's unfair to blame the staff who are doing their job. There's no public bathrooms which I think is reasonable given its size and the fact that it is literally inside a Target which I believe has bathrooms. All in all be nice to hospitality workers because their jobs are hard. :-)"
Starbucks,Very slow service. The employees don't know how to prioritize. They talk to each other instead of focusing on their job. The line was really long and it didn't seem to matter to them. They were out of almond milk and don't seem to accept orders through the app. Never coming to this Starbucks again.
Starbucks,The baristas are always courteous and work very efficient.   The place seems to look clean and accommodating the crowd. The menu is always variety and scrumptious. The rewatd always makes you feel good to be appreciated as their customers.
Starbucks,So I asked about ordering on the app and was told I would have to pick it up across the street by a nice young lady and with a sorry that was given with a sincere smile. Walked across the street and total difference in treatment. From the get go I told the girl I ordered on my phone but wanted 2 cookies. I asked which ones were good and she did recommend some good ones but it came with such attitude. She charged me and sent me on my way. 15 mins later nothing except dirty looks fromzv
Starbucks,"Super busy, out of things often, got directed to go across the street on two separate occasions. So I would say if you’re in the area the other is the better option. The customer service here is fine! It just stinks that they don’t have things stocked."
Starbucks,"It's Starbucks, but that's the point right!   When you go to Starbucks you can get exactly what you want and it will taste as expected.   I am loving the app especially.  Order, walk in, pickup, who can complain about easy peasy!!"
Starbucks,"The frappes are more water than anything else. At least the one my mom and I got. No good. The good thing is that it is almost night and we didnt get too much sugar but thats not an excuse. Another thing, I had to ask for the chocolate syrup on top of the mocha frappe."
Starbucks,Its good place at intersection and street view The crew are friendly
Starbucks,"I have been to many different stores from Seattle to San Diego on the West coast ,  Maui, Oahu, Reno and Vegas over the years because I travel regularly. This store I was going to when going to work late in SF. This one is Consistently the Worse One Hands Down. I tried to overlook the filthy condiment counter, the employees who seem to be pre-occupied with their cellphones, or are gabbing amongst themselves when the store is  busy and will ignore you until they are done, as well as the  fact that they are almost Always out of Sugar in the Raw and Half and Half. But what Really was the last straw for me was that they are out of coffee Frequently, and I mean this happens on a regular basis with 3-4 people sometimes ""working"" and I am not exaggerating! I know it is crewed by Target employees, so there is no tipping (they put out a ""Stealth Cup anyways sometimes) but that is no excuse because they are compensated for this. This is an observation of mine over the last 3 years of going there because it is convenient and all the other stores are closed when I go to work. But no more after I walked in last night and Again they were out of Coffee 1 hour before closing and the employee turned and ""discovered"" they were out of All of their brewed coffee. She just stood there after informing me of this, and just said to her co-worker - Nobody made the Coffee? Didn't bother with offering to brew a fresh pot, or an Americana, Nothing! She just stood there looking at me, as if to say Oh Well! Fortunately they just opened a new Pete's around the corner that also stays open late!"
Starbucks,"I always order the ""short house"" for a variety always changing once a month to a new flavor if the coffee seems too strong ask for an Americano which is a watered-down version of a European coffee"
Starbucks,Then make a great caramel frappuccino here and when you get us for extra caramel they give you extra caramel
Starbucks,I order regular coffee it was like water  I would like return and ask try before it’s was same I just ask. Normal regular coffee what I always drink They just ruin my break
Starbucks,Friendly staff!! Fast efficient service. Great place to get a drink if you’re in the area or shopping at Target!
Starbucks,The baristas don't mix the drink well and they don't make the drinks flavor and tasteful they don't measure the ingredients correctly Don't recommend this Starbucks is under Metreon cinema cross by marquis Merriott
Starbucks,"It's a Starbucks, just like any other... And it's next Target. So, there're a lot of people and it doesn't have many places to sit... It was in my way, but I prefer Philz."
Starbucks,"Mmmm Starbucks @ Church & Market inside Safeway is the Bomb. Emilio & Steve sure know how to make my Frappuccinos super Tasty. Ask for Steve, He does it RIGHT!!!"
Starbucks,"A quick coffee or tea before going shopping at Target, is always nice, and helps your shopping go so much quicker!!"
Starbucks,Great place for coffee go every morning staff are pleasant place is clean and tidy can get busy at times
Starbucks,The Starbucks across the street is much more comfortable if you are looking for somewhere to sit while drinking your coffee.
Starbucks,"Place could be a little cleaner. There were homeless people walking in and out.  Drinks were alright, I've had better."
Starbucks,"I like the Starbucks at 44 Montgomery street. They have lots of seating, including comfortable chairs, and the décor and atmosphere are nice."

Starbucks,MY favourite  is the peanutbutter jelly lunch  pack chocolate rasin Im a kid on the play ground now back 2 work
Starbucks,I ordered 4000 lattes to go and they made them in twenty minutes! Very impressed
Starbucks,"Lack of seating makes this location mainly good for takeout, which sort of is not the experience you are paying the premium for."
Starbucks,"No, your Starbucks coupons and promotions won't work here. Don't bother. Go across the street."

Starbucks,"Bad experience in this Starbuck: a quarter of an hour wait for a latte, while there are few customers. They are four behind the counter but totally disorganized. There are two chatting while customers wait, and the other two start a task but don't finish it and attack another. The preparer spends more time cleaning up spills than making the coffees. Starbuck should come and explain to its staff how to allocate roles and organize tasks to save time."
Starbucks,"The place is very accessible, windy with food half empty, we waited a long time for the preparation of a drink."
Starbucks,It's good food but they need more customer service
