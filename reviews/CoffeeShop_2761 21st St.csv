CoffeeShop,The cortado is perfect. It’s brewed at the perfect temperature; the coffee was smooth and not bitter/burned at all.
CoffeeShop,Lovely little neighborhood coffee shop. They have great coffee and tea options as well as amazing pastries. Their baristas are very friendly and super helpful. Great spot to grab a coffee while sitting outside and enjoying a sunny Mission day.
CoffeeShop,Love this place! Very warm atmosphere and cool owners. The coco vitamin round bar was delicious.
CoffeeShop,"On Sunday mornings, I try to go out in the mornings and support local coffee shops.  I use my Nespresso machine on most days now!   I usually order just a espresso, a coffee when I'm outside.  I ordered the hot chocolate, Latte, and a espresso!It was too early for iced coffee w/coffee ice cubes!  Bulletproof coffee or Sherpa sounds too rich in fat for me!  Not bad espresso and a good latte. Great neighborhood spot. Cute small shop and friendly and hard working batista!  Easy parking in front on a Sunday morning."
CoffeeShop,"Wow where has this coffee shop been?! The coffee and tea here is spectacular, and the guy working at the counter was super nice and helpful. I got the iced sherpa (made with espresso) and it was one of the best cups of coffee I’ve had in SF! Big time props for this spot, a must try in Bernal Heights 🙌🏽"
CoffeeShop,Great coffee and nice selection of pastries. Wish they had a few tables inside but perfect for a coffee on the go.
CoffeeShop,I think this is the best coffee in San Francisco. The people that work here are awesome and it has a real bohemian vibe. I'll always come here when in SF.
CoffeeShop,The guys there are super nice it's a small little shop but I love it and they have the best cookies ever
CoffeeShop,"Great coffee at an affordable price. Little to no wait, friendly service, and just an adorable enviroment. Love their choice of sweeteners.  Not sure why the Google Maps Label is 'CoffeeShop'- It's under a different name. Will look into it."
CoffeeShop,"I love this coffee shop! My favorite drink is the Iced Coffee and although it sounds simple enough, it’s actually a super sonic blast of caffeine for those who likes it nice and strong. The ice cubes are made out of coffee themselves! Their pastries are homemade too."
CoffeeShop,"Love the quality of the coffee, baked goods are in-house and awesome!"
CoffeeShop,"Got the iced coffee - it’s amazing! The cold brew ice cubes are so smart, keeping the coffee cold while not diluting it. Wilson is super nice and delightful to chat with. Looking forward to trying out more of his drinks and pastries"
CoffeeShop,A wickedly friendly and small walk up coffee establishment serving up the best vibes. Perfect for on the go coffee while walking through the city or go slow and drink outside.  💯 …
CoffeeShop,Amazing little gem. I am a terrible coffee snob.The Cortado here was perfect.Best coffee I had in months. Glad I stumbled across this place(hard to find v discreet)
CoffeeShop,"Fantastic little neighborhood gem with great pastries, delicious coffees, and a beautiful Amos Goldbaum mural"
CoffeeShop,"Cute local coffee shop, fast and free Wi-Fi, with a few outdoor sitting, and delicious cappuccino"
CoffeeShop,"The Owners, Wilson & Olga are the salt of the earth.  I've been getting coffee here consistently for 5 years. I was joking with one of their Barista's (Maya) the other day that I've been getting coffee here so long that I've been through several of her relationships.  Btw, Maya is awesome & one of my favorites.  I highly recommend the CoffeeShop & I will continue to get coffee here for years to come."
CoffeeShop,It’s not ok to sell day old pastry at full price and then say it’s baked today when it clearly isn’t.  This has happened multiple times and I’m sad to give this review because I go to this place so often and they have great coffee.  The owner needs to change their policy around pastry because right now it’s really underhanded.
CoffeeShop,"Top coffee in SF! Wilson was delightful and welcoming. The coffee and pastries are incredible. I didn’t get beans this time, but I’m excited to go back and try them. This place was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks, Wilson!"
CoffeeShop,"I LOVE this place. Delicious coffee, tea and babychino!  So low key but such high quality.  The people working there are the absolute best too. Go!"
CoffeeShop,"Owned by a lovely husband and wife, this is truly a family business! They make amazing coffee and all their own pastries (try the cheesy muffin with a boiled egg inside!). They also add coffee ice cubes to cold drinks so they don’t get watery while they melt. Genius!"
CoffeeShop,We walked by this cute little coffee shop yesterday and decided to stop in. The decor is great with the wood paneling and mural of Bernal. The owner is delightful and was very careful when handing us our coffee and pastries. She makes all the pastries and they were fantastic. As was the coffee. Highly recommend.
CoffeeShop,"COFFEE ICE CUBES.  I love cold brew but I'm a slow drinker so that leaves me with watered down cold brew almost every time I get one.  BUT not at CoffeeShop! I was seriously blown away by the coffee ice cubes because that just shows me they try and care about their coffee. On top of that, the coffee was delicious.  It's a small shop and they sell a variety of drinks and pastries. They've got some interesting concoctions but I normally just go for the simple drinks so you'd have to try that for yourself.  Service was great! The staff was friendly and quick. Overall great place to stop by for coffee!"
CoffeeShop,Warm. Neighborly. Good coffee. This is all I need and everything is amazing.
CoffeeShop,It’s a cute little coffee shop with a few chairs outside to sit down. Their coffee was sooooo good and the barista was very friendly. overall a very good experience and I would defiantly go back while I am in the area.
CoffeeShop,CoffeeShop is the best coffee shop in San Francisco. Coffee is absolutely amazing and really tastes good. Reasonable price are worth it. Staffs are approachable. I love the place its comfy and cool atmosphere. I recommend this place. Wanna go back here again together with my close friends.
CoffeeShop,"The best place to get some high-quality coffee with true love made into it.  They ice their coffee with frozen coffee cubes.  How can that be beat? Plus,  they'll customize your drink however you'd like and are great people with an ethical business practice.  Just ask them anything about their shop and they'll let you in on all of it! :)"
CoffeeShop,"I've been to this spot three times this week, and all three times one of the owners was not wearing a mask. Two of the times, he had his mask off while a customer was in the shop. When I arrived today and he wasn't wearing a mask, I asked that he wear it more consistently. He aggressively shouted at me, kicked me out of the shop and locked the door.  The other owner is an incredibly nice person and has always worn her mask, as have other employees. I have always had pleasant experiences when they were working. Additionally, they have awesome coffee and snacks. However, I can't continue to support this business if an apparent anti-masker continues to work there."
CoffeeShop,the ice coffee is so good that I have to come back next day for it!
CoffeeShop,"You have to try Sherpa and Bulletproof coffee. Small one will keep you going for whole day and won't feel that your heart is jumping out of your mouth. Must try!!  BTW, Wilson's special ice coffee is another special treat. You'll never find it anywhere else. On the top of it, the owner Wilson is such a happy and nice guy. Enjoy your coffee experience here  😋"
CoffeeShop,"A gem of a neighborhood coffee shop. The owners, part of the neighborhood, adapt their ever-evolving menu to the tastes of their customers by offering samples and asking for feedback. Coffee ranks right up there with the more popular ""best"" in SF.  Homemade sweets and lunch treats. Humor & philosophical discussions gratis. I wish I still worked across the street- I use to go almost every day!"
CoffeeShop,"I will highly recommend this coffee shop to everyone because they have friendly service, awesome coffee, and a really good price. When I ordered a delicious coffee, I was so surprised by the price because it was so reasonably cheap! Keep it up!"
CoffeeShop,"The challenge I was given was: Find a top 5 coffee place in all of San Francisco. After a lot of research, I hit upon this gem, in the mission.  Ironically, we had passed this tiny, shoe-box sized, family owned place, several times - it is easy to miss.  Once you are inside, your are greeted with the aromas of cawfee, and baked goods. They have an excellent selection of baked goods, including, vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free options form donuts to date rolls to many other coffee accouterments.  This is a pour-over coffee paradise. Be prepared for the owner to recommend the right coffee (he tunes into you), by specifying if you are light, dark or medium roast person. I picked dark, and he recommended an excellent crop from Brazil. My friend picked medium, and he recommended Ethiopia. She knows her coffee, and as a SF native, she felt this was right at the top.  They also have almond, half and half and many types of milk choices, as well as the less adventurous lattes, mochas, teas, espressos.  The owner said their secret sauce is customer service - and we experienced the warmth and genuine passion of a master barista, who hand picks the shop's blends."
CoffeeShop,Roasted coffee beans made great brews at home. Love their staff and owner. Baked goods are house made and delicious.
CoffeeShop,"Coffee was delicious and awesome service. The guy at the counter was not your stamped barista like at Starbucks. He was bold friendly and very helpful, we got to sample different things because we couldn't make up our mind. Definitely worth the drive we will come back when around this side of San Francisco"
CoffeeShop,"Barista was friendly and informative. Loved the Ethiopian brew; wasn't sour or acidic at all, the way other roasts can be at 'Third Wave' coffee places. The know-nothing is the healthiest snack there and it's quite delicious. If you check into Yelp, you can get half off your drink on your first visit. There's not a lot of seating; just a couple tables outside."
CoffeeShop,"My wife and I travelled to San Francisco from Houston during 2015 Thanksgiving and stopped by Wilson's coffee shop. The coffee was one of the best we have ever tasted. Wilson was super friendly to talk to. It made our trip very happy. I also bought a bag of UBUNTU coffee home, brewed this morning, and it was darn good!"
CoffeeShop,"Like having coffee in Harry Potter's cupboard beneath the stairs.  Came here specifically for their ""Sherpa"" which is coffee and butter blended together.  Tastes a bit like a very rich latte.  Tastes even better with honey added.  Be prepared for a wait since there's only one woman doing all the work.  My wait time was a little over 15 minutes when there were 3 people ahead if me who ordered espresso drinks."
CoffeeShop,"Starts my day off right almost every morning! I'm a coffee snob, and this place definitely passes the test, really good coffee. If you wish to try something a little more funky, Try the Sherpa or the dirty matcha.. That's a matcha latte with a shot of espresso! Also, really good home-baked goods. I love the vegan hemp/banana/oat balls!"
CoffeeShop,"Every coffee, tea, baked good, and experience at CoffeeShop is made with 100% love and uniqueness.  This evening I savored a silky, smooth Sherpa and an invigorating  iced coffee, both crafted to perfection by Wilson.  I also brought home some delicious cookies.  You've got to get over here and sample CoffeeShop's diverse menu and talented baristas. Love you guys!"
CoffeeShop,"Good coffee tasty pastries. Barista was quick, a bit brusk but warmed up our muffin. No seating inside, there are a few seats/side tables outside. Loved the muffin with an egg inside."
CoffeeShop,This is the best coffee shop in San Francisco. It’s a family run business that pays attention to every little detail and design aesthetic. And the coffee is absolutely amazing. Worth the trip for locals and tourists alike.
CoffeeShop,"Uneducated barista. Would not recommend for espresso based drinks.  I don’t know how this shop has 4.8 stars. I ordered a cortado, which is 2oz espresso + 2oz steamed milk.  The barista made me a 6 ounce drink (2oz espresso + 4oz milk) and served it in an 8 oz cup. To make matters worse, the cup had no handles that nearly burned my hand to touch. Milk was over-steamed and drink had overall bitter taste that resembled a Starbucks coffee drink.  Maybe I got unlucky with the drink I received, but the barista not knowing the coffee/milk ratio for a cortado is a huge flag. I won’t give this shop another chance.  The shop gets 2 stars because it’s cute and has a large, clean bathroom. But I came for good coffee, not to relieve my bladder. Left and walked to another shop In the area which was much better."
CoffeeShop,Even though the card machine was down and took forever to find the place (my fault) the coffee was amazing. The Sherpa was very good but just the coffee itself is fantastic.
CoffeeShop,"A cute little hole in the wall! The iced coffee has coffee ice cubes which are great, though it was more bitter than I'd prefer. Little pastries and donuts looked delicious. Staff is friendly."
CoffeeShop,Love this place! Great coffee and service.
CoffeeShop,Great and skillful in coffee making. Bought a pastry as well which was rich and flavorful. Best coffee we drank in the US during our travels
CoffeeShop,"SF's best barista;  i have toured almost all of SF's coffee shops.  this little hidden gem is a hole in the wall, boostrapped by Wilson with a small budget.  that's what makes it even more of a miracle, the great coffee he's able to produce.  he uses great ingredients, mostly organic and high quality stuff.  it's a family owned place, where the owner is the main barista on most days, something so hard to find in big cities and in coffee chains.  highly recommended experience."
CoffeeShop,"The saddest part about leaving my last job was that I no longer had a reason to go by the Coffee Shop on my way to work every day. Wilson and his team are some of the friendliest, most welcoming baristas I've ever met and they were a great way to start my work day."
CoffeeShop,I really like this place! But the last two times I’ve tried to come here there has been a sign outside that says “be right back”. Both times we’ve waited 10-15+ minutes and no one ever shows up. At least 5 people came and went today waiting for them to re-open. It’s hard to justify making the special trip to CoffeeShop again when it might all be a waste of time.
CoffeeShop,"Um, I hate this place. Stay away so I don’t have to wait in line, LOL! Truly wonderful people. Truly excellent coffee. Delicious pastries."
CoffeeShop,"Every detail is of the utmost quality. Impressive operation. Can tell by the decor, vibe, and community that a premium product has made believers out of clientele.  I kept hearing about the benefits of Sherpa Coffee and came to see for myself. I'm a believer."
CoffeeShop,"At this great little @CoffeeShop (with the perfect name) on Mission Street near Pracita, where you can pick yourself up a coffee, a tea or some tasty treats. It's a tiny shop that is easy to spot since it has a bright green storefront (think Kermit the Frog). The inside has a very creative and custom feel that includes chalk art from various art inspired customers. I hung out and spent some time chatting with the staff about the business and getting recommendations on what to try. I ended up getting an iced Yerba Mate and a gluten free cake with coconut. They make their own baked goods and pour each cup individually for a real customized experience."
CoffeeShop,"I love the honor system Wilson setup for coffee drinkers on the go. There is also a custom mural from Amos on the back wall. Better yet, Cookie Co 415 is next door. Wake and bake!"
CoffeeShop,Stopped by here twice on my last visit to San Francisco.  Get the iced coffee here.  It's the only place I've seen that freezes coffee and uses it as ice cubes. Wilson is one of the nicest and friendliest barrista's ever.  Makes a mean chemex drip too.
CoffeeShop,"My friend and I were sitting outside this warm Indian summer afternoon for ice coffee and macaroons. The macaroons are local and I find them better than the ones from certain places across town that have more name recognition. OK, most macaroons are good, but these are better. A word about the ice coffee: the ice cubes are themselves made of ice coffee (think granita) and there is a methodology. It seems the brewed coffee is cooled to 55 degrees Fahrenheit, stirred often, then cooled at 41 degrees overnight. It's a blend of Salvadorean and Bolivian coffees from Ubuntu (the Emeryville cooperative,not the Linux distribution). A word about service: the owner appeared at our table with more ice coffee: ""It seems you like it"". Another  word about service: he came back with a very refreshing but completely unordered Yerba Mate iced tea!"
CoffeeShop,"My favorite coffee in the city. Great for grabbing an exceptional latte before hopping on the Bart or exploring the Mission. Cute, small space and friendly, skilled staff."
CoffeeShop,Very cute shop  The taste of green tea is too sweet.  Fresh croissants are delicious.
CoffeeShop,Excellent coffee. The best cold brew in the city and an excellent pour over too.  And they use frozen coffee ice cubes in the cold brew which is a nice touch.
CoffeeShop,Truely the best  whether you're getting simply a pour over or a latte iced or hot. Great service and nice folks running the places. Great people at all places and they'll gladly help you pick a great flavor for you to try.
CoffeeShop,"Very delicious coffee in a stylish but unpretentious, friendly place - and yummy small breakfast options and baked goods. The coffee beans smell amazing!"
CoffeeShop,"Grabbing a cappuccino at CoffeeShop is what makes a morning in this crazy world feel normal,,, or normalish 😋 …"
CoffeeShop,"If you're serious about great coffee, CoffeeShop is the place to be.  WIlson (the owner) is serious about the art and science of the pour, and the locally baked goodies are always fresh and amazing!"
CoffeeShop,"Best Place Ever! I had an excellent dirty chai and a delicious, warm & certainly to be had again pastry called the ""dirty devil"" I believe. By far my favorite lil nook & chai I could ask for!"
CoffeeShop,Very cute place with nice service and good coffee ❤️
CoffeeShop,"MY FAVORITE TOAST IN THE WHOLE WORLD. If you want to get DOWN on some peanut butter, butter-y goodness, get their toast with pb & honey. It is definitely NOT healthy, but is SO good. And SO much peanut butter for like $3. haha."
CoffeeShop,"Best coffee I had in San Francisco. Delicious brew, yummy breakfast treats, and friendly service. Would highly recommend!"
CoffeeShop,"Love the drinks here! The best near Bernal, especially the matchas"
CoffeeShop,I love starting my morning off here! Best customer service and amazing coffee!! Best chi tea latte I have ever had.
CoffeeShop,"The aesthetic draws you in but the coffee is not good. Espresso drinks, drip, all poor quality. Beans taste overroasted."
CoffeeShop,"I headed out to find what I know as ""Bullet Proof Coffee"". The little adventure was well worth finding this great little Coffee shop ""busting at the seams"" with nice vibes and delicious treats."
CoffeeShop,"Still closed at 7:20....says they are open at 7 drove here On my way To work, wont have time for coffee now. Rough...."
CoffeeShop,"Great (but small) place un Mission to take the morning coffee. They have only two tables outside, so is more like a take-away coffee shop."
CoffeeShop,A bit tragically hipster and little space to sit but really fantastic coffee. Also has quite the array of vegan cookies.
CoffeeShop,Coffee really good. 5 stars because the barista/owner also gave free coffee to a homeless man. Heart.
CoffeeShop,"Hard to find off the street, but it's worth the extra few seconds of squinting to realize that indeed the place is called ""CoffeeShop.""  Go here if you are looking for something fast, but still fantastic."
CoffeeShop,"One of the most adorable, warm Caffè in the town. Great location, loving service, and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! !!! Keep on the good work!"
