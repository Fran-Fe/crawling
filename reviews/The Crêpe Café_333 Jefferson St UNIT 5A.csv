The Crêpe Café,"We found this crepe place on our family trip to San Francisco, and it was amazing! They’ve got tons of different crepes and they all taste great. You could eat here for every meal, but the dessert crepes are the real stars.  The spot has indoor and outdoor seating, which was a nice touch. And it’s right in the wharf, so you can stop by while you’re sightseeing. Can’t recommend this place enough for anyone who loves good food. We’ll definitely be back next time we’re in town!"
The Crêpe Café,"Walking by a crepe cafe is something I rarely do without having walked inside first. If made right they are delicious, flavorful and wonderful to eat. Many are filled with an assortment of fruits with bananas and strawberries being the most popular. You’ll also find chocolate which, only enhances its overall flavor. Unfortunately, the only fruits available were bananas and strawberries. I can’t tell you the exact calorie count nor do I want to. Just know they’re delicious and a delight to eat. So, enjoy The Crepe Cafe while in San Francisco."
The Crêpe Café,"The Crêpes were very delicious and there wasn't much of a line, though a few minutes later, it was long. There are many tables and a bar top too. I got the Strawberry Nutella crêpe and it was good. Highly recommend and there are one or two places to charge up."
The Crêpe Café,Gross. Worst crepes I’ve ever had. Crepe batter doesn’t have good flavor. Gave me rotten bananas. Even if the bananas were fresh it wouldn’t have tasted good. Coffee wasn’t good either.
The Crêpe Café,Very american crepe cafe with both sweet and savory crepes ! The have a nice pation with outdoor seating on the backside . We tried the nutella crepe with cream and sugar - definitely coming back here again! The gourmet crepes will try next time- looked very good!
The Crêpe Café,"Honestly a really great breakfast and lunch place if you're staying at a hotel nearby! I actually got a bread bowl of chowder, which was completely delicious!! Crepes are good as well and a wide variety of coffee and tea options."
The Crêpe Café,Steak crepe and bread bowl is good but they burnt the coffee beans
The Crêpe Café,Stopped in for little Crepes by the Fisherman's Warf.  It's a  cute space.  Ordered the strawberry banana and Nutella and it came out fast and was terrific.
The Crêpe Café,"So good we ate here 2 days in a row! Cafe latte and savory egg, spinach, tomato crepe was huge and great start to a day of sightseeing. My daughter loved the mixed fruit with whipped cream. Staff are friendly and service was prompt so we could eat and be on our way. Definitely recommend!"
The Crêpe Café,For tourists. I asked for a Ketchup to go with my soggy fries. They told me that they need to charge me extra for that.
The Crêpe Café,"It’s nice, specially if you’re in for something sweet! The crepe was thicker than in a traditional French recipe and much sweeter too. It’s was overall a nice meal but nothing that it’s going to change your day, I’ve tried a simple cheese and ham one and because the batter was very sweet didn’t feel like the right combination there! I would definitely go for a chocolate one, as a nice dessert 😊"
The Crêpe Café,Having been in San Francisco over the summer they were closed when I came so I had to stop in when I came back. Well that was a HUGE MISTAKE! I ordered the chicken they were out of crab 🤦🏾 and it had more onions than chicken and the clam chowder had nice chunks of clams and more rosemary than the law allows. So I trashed it all $30 just wasted and went and spent $20 at another restaurant.
The Crêpe Café,"So many crêpe options here; sweet or savory, take your pick. For my choice, the crab crêpe was definitely worth the price. Also offers ice cream cones and other baked things. Outdoor seating is through the back, and orders come out pretty quickly despite how busy the place might be."
The Crêpe Café,"The crepe tasted and was firmly more like a tortilla. Very saddened in that this was not a crepe. The filling was good, hard to go wrong with chocolate, strawberries and bananas. They were offering bread bowls and a slew of other menu items, but for a place to be named after a crepe, my hopes were high and quickly dashed. Would not re immediately for crepes."
The Crêpe Café,"Excellent crepes!!!! Clean restaurant, fun window at street side to watch them being made. My only complaint is I didn't the one I ordered.  It was to go so I didn't realize till I got to the hotel to eat it. It was still good."
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for the mix up! We appreciate your business and feedback! Hope you’ll give us another shot next time you’re in the area. Thank you!
The Crêpe Café,Crepes were delicious. The line was long so service was a little slow. The restaurant itself was super dirty. Most people were taking the crepes to go because none of the tables were cleaned off. Maybe 3 families were sitting down inside. The remaining tables were all empty and dirty waiting to be cleaned.
The Crêpe Café,excellent service recommended good flavor and varieties
The Crêpe Café,"Other than opening 30 minutes late, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend this place! There are a wide variety of crepe flavors and waffles. The only reason I did not give it five starts is because it opened late and there were a lot of people waiting outside the door."
The Crêpe Café,"Hi Amanda, Thank you for your feedback. So sorry that we opened late. Was that today, Sunday? Did we open at 9:30? We appreciate your info and business!"
The Crêpe Café,"Had a Steak Crepe, steak was tuff as leather, crepe itself was lacking taste 😩. Coffee was excellent. Prices were cheap so kinda set the bar really."
The Crêpe Café,Good dessert range at a reasonable price. The staff was super friendly and helpful.
The Crêpe Café,"A great place with a large choice of crepes, breakfast choices, clam chowder and hot/cold drinks. Bright and cozy, has an outdoor sitting area in the courtyard. Very welcoming and clean."
The Crêpe Café,"Hi Alla, thank you for your feedback. Great to hear you enjoyed dining with us! Hope you'll say hi next time you're in the area :)"
The Crêpe Café,"So sorry for selfishly forgetting to take pics. The crepes and service were A+. We had the Nutella, Banana, Strawberry crepes, and then got 2 lemon crepes to go.  Flavorful, well made, cost was reasonable. Service was great!. They packaged the crepes well and even though we didn't get to the lemon crepes until much later, they were delicious even when cooled.  Will definitely be back and back again."
The Crêpe Café,"I'm sure they have good food, but I had the hot chocolate and it tasted bland and  watery."
The Crêpe Café,"Food was nice. Service was standard. Nothing Gluten-free. Clean, though cloth seats could do with a scrub."
The Crêpe Café,It was good but I'm used to my crepes bring more soft and light. My crepe was more like a wafer. It was loaded and delicious though if you are craving it.
The Crêpe Café,"Hi Melissa, Thank you for your feedback! We really appreciate it and happy you enjoyed the taste!"
The Crêpe Café,"Small, bustling location with a decent selection of sweet and savory crepes. We had a selection of both. Savory crepes include fillings like spinach, mushrooms and cheese and were large portions - got value for the $10 cost. Banana, strawberry and Nutella are probably the most popular choices amongst sweet crepes, you can get additional toppings for $2 each. Kids loved the choices they selected. Belgian waffle topped with strawberries was also excellent. The surprise of the lot were the funnel cake fries - a ‘new’ delicious option."
The Crêpe Café,"Thanks for being your family to The Crepe Cafe Ratul! Awesome review, it made our day! We hope to see you again soon!"
The Crêpe Café,"Love it so much, the crepes were delicious, long line but worth the wait. Will go back soon."
The Crêpe Café,"Hands down the best clam chowder on in that area.  I was being lazy and didn't want to venture out in the cold while my friend got in and out.  This was definitely a happy little mistake. I would not ever considered clam chowder from the crepe Cafe but im glad I took the chance.  Great flavor profile with vegetables and clams, the bread bowl was good too."
The Crêpe Café,"Okay-ish place. Sort of overpriced. The pictures of strawberry crepe in the store have chocolate sauce on them but they actually serve it without chocolate sauce (only strawberries and cream)! Had to pay extra for the sauce on top.  Taste was not exceptional, but not bad either."
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for your negative experience with us. We appreciate your business and feedback! Hope you’ll give us another shot next time you’re in the area. Thank you!
The Crêpe Café,"If you're looking for a crepe by the bay, this is the place to go! I had two (one for a meal and one for dessert), and they were nothing short of excellent. Highly recommend!"
The Crêpe Café,Oh man I wish I took a photo of my delicious clam chowder bowl. the perfect crunch of the bread and the amazing clam chowder itself was so dang good you gotta try it. I don't say that often about food and I go to the best of the best. I'm going for their crepes next.  Oh and say hi to Santos for me he's the best host. He's so nice and friendly and so is their crepe chef. Whatever they're doing in that shop they're doing their best and are exceeding at the game! 5 stars for sure !! 🤩❤️
The Crêpe Café,The veggie crepe was very good! I liked that it had fresh sprouts. Adding a combo can be a bit pricey for just a drink and fries. The crepe is satisfying on it's own.
The Crêpe Café,"Nice and cozy place to have breakfast. The location is great, and food is super tasty."
The Crêpe Café,Good crépe. I used their wall charger for 2+ hours.
The Crêpe Café,Had the Nutella crepes there was a lot but it was delicious I definitely remember it
The Crêpe Café,Love Love Love Everything About This Place! We Are Locals & Its Our Family Spot Everytime We Are @ The Pier For A Quick Pick Me Up.
The Crêpe Café,Wow thank you for your wonderful feedback Faimun! See you guys next time!
The Crêpe Café,The food here was great. I loved my strawberry nutella crepe. Parking was not extremely difficult. The vibe inside the restaurant itself was pretty cozy as well. I'd come back here if visiting this place again.
The Crêpe Café,Very interesting and food was delicious. We had the steak crepe combo and everything was good. No issues. Place is quaint and can get busy.
The Crêpe Café,The savory crepes were fine but not great. Ingredients were a bit low quality
The Crêpe Café,We enjoyed delicious crepes. Heoe that you'll be able to stop by this place and savor the crepes.
The Crêpe Café,Stopped for a bite while at Fisherman's Wharf. Delicious!
The Crêpe Café,Had a quick stop here. The place was clean and staff were very friendly. But the food was definitely not up to what I was expecting. I have had much better crepes before.
The Crêpe Café,"The crepe was just ok, not crunchy, doesn't seem fresh made. There's no toilet in the restaurant, you need to use a shared one outside which is dirty and smells."
The Crêpe Café,amazing. beeakfast crepe was pretty solid if you add the spicy mayo
The Crêpe Café,Really delicious mixed fruit Nutella crepe and veggie crepe. Which service. Comfortable seating. Decent pricing. I wish the quantity could have been more.
The Crêpe Café,Over priced but fairly good crepes
The Crêpe Café,Going here by yourself or friends is good. When you bring your family it becomes expensive.
The Crêpe Café,"The crepe is good, the price is an average, and they do outdoor seat"
The Crêpe Café,Thanks for coming in Chloe! See you again next time! We hope you enjoyed your crepe
The Crêpe Café,"Such a cool place!  Great food, fun atmosphere."
The Crêpe Café,Super Nice guys here. Recommend just for atmosphere.
The Crêpe Café,I am having Crab Crepes now. It’s awesome. Lot’s of crab meat. It’s fresh and tasty.
The Crêpe Café,I ordered the smores crepe and it was pure sugar rather than flavor.  Serves me right for trying a crepe in Fisherman's Wharf.
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for your negative experience with us last year. We appreciate your business and feedback! Hope you’ll give us another shot next time you’re in the area. Thank you!
The Crêpe Café,Really good crepes. Try the crab and avacado. It was really good.
The Crêpe Café,"Awesome spot. I was a little unsure how much food I would get for my money, but I found it reasonable. I got a savory crepe and an order or garlic fries. The fries come with real garlic on top which I was not expecting.  There is a nice little seating area out back but there were a lot of birds around which was a little annoying.  Highly recommended"
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you for your feedback, Mike. Happy you enjoyed :)"
The Crêpe Café,"We enjoyed everything, no frills easy and good"
The Crêpe Café,"Delicious and fast.  We walked in late in the day and just needed something good and fast and they delivered perfectly.  The crepes were tasty with a ton of selections, allowing everyone in the group to get something that met their craving. We will definitely go back again."
The Crêpe Café,Thank you Lance! See you next time!
The Crêpe Café,"Great food. Awesome Carmel Mociatta and various crepes. Great, quick service! Will be my 1st stop when back in San Fran."
The Crêpe Café,"Really tasty nutella banana crepe, tourist prices though"
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you, Jali!"
The Crêpe Café,"Supposed to be open at 9 according to their posted sign.  Kids on their phones with the gate down and not doing anything.  Door open, yelled in to ask when they would open, absolutely no reply would not even look up from her phone the cashier…"
The Crêpe Café,"Delicious and fast food, and we ate outside in the courtyard. Staff who helped us were super friendly and it was less busy than places closer to fisherman's wharf and pier 39"
The Crêpe Café,"I have to start by saying the crepes were very good. We went for breakfast just as they opened so there was no crowd to contend with. The reason for the 3 star rating is that it is a ""fast food"" operation. You order and pay at a counter. They give you a number and when your food is ready they yell your number and you have to pick it up. It's served on paper plates with plastic cutlery and the coffee comes in paper cups. There is a nice shared patio behind. As I said the crepes were good but I was expecting a restaurant not a cafeteria."
The Crêpe Café,"Hi Elliott, thank you for your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve. While we are a ""quick service"" restaurant, we definitely take our customer experience very seriously. Would you think that having the food delivered to you would make it more enjoyable?"
The Crêpe Café,The crab crepe was delicious and the perfect combination of sweet and savory!
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you for your feedback, Alexandria!  So happy you enjoyed :)"
The Crêpe Café,"I had the deluxe breakfast burrito and the wrap was light and crispy. The cheese melted perfectly over the soft potatoes and crispy bacon. My wife had the banana Nutella crepe and it was also very great. The service was very quick and extremely nice. It’s really close to our hotel, so we will be back for a quick breakfast before work."
The Crêpe Café,So glad you enjoyed your meal. Thanks for dining with us and hope you had a nice trip :)
The Crêpe Café,"This place offer delicious and fast crepes. All the ingredients are fresh and the service is pretty good. We had breakfast and dinner different days and still the flavors didn’t change. I recommend the crab crepe, packed with a lot of avocado."
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you for your feedback, Mauricio! So happy to hear you enjoyed your crab crepe and dining with us :)"
The Crêpe Café,"These crepes are HUGE and so delicious!  Places like this need to exist in more locations!  I had the mixed fruit/nutella....mm mm. My fiancé had the Hawaiian crepe, which consisted of ham and pineapple.  The crepe was pretty good. The pineapple was canned and that was a little disappointing.  I thought a place like like this, in the heart of a popular tourist destination,  they would have more ""fresh"" ingredients.  The quality and taste would definitely rise!"
The Crêpe Café,Thank you so much for your feedback!
The Crêpe Café,"Cute little place down by water in San Francisco. Great for kids especially. Can be busy and definitely pricey, but its San Francisco. Great options for crepes. Ranges from sweet to savory. A variety of sides like fries, garlic fries."
The Crêpe Café,Thank you! So happy you enjoyed :)
The Crêpe Café,"Got the no frills Strawberry crepe, it was good, not great.   Might have been awesome if we got the chocolate Strawberry version."
The Crêpe Café,"Very friendly staff. We got tired of paying over $60 for breakfast every morning of our trip in the San Francisco area, so I insisted on checking this place out! They have plenty of dessert/savory/breakfast crepes to choose from, there is something on the menu for everyone. Coffee is pretty good too. We were certainly not disappointed. I tried the Nutella fruit crepes (yum!!) and the Hawaiian crepe. Actually came back 3 times during our 6-day stay."
The Crêpe Café,Their crepe are delicious and the chicken sandwich with pesto was awesome.
The Crêpe Café,Thanks for coming in Jose! We appreciate your business and your kind comments 😁😋
The Crêpe Café,"We split a strrawberry, banana, nutella crepe.  It was surpringly good for wharf food!  It was packed with fruit and had no shortage of nutella.  I wish there was a bit more whipped cream.  I would totally stop in again!"
The Crêpe Café,"Very fast service and great crepes. Had the Breakfast Special and it was a hearty, great tasting meal."
The Crêpe Café,Delicious 😋 Everything here was fresh and delicious! We tried several crepes and coffee on different days and it was delicious!
The Crêpe Café,"I visited this Cafe and had the pleasure of enjoying the best latte and most mouthwatering crepe I have ever had.  ( and I""ve had crepes in France).  5 stars and more.  Loved it and will be going back next week."
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you so much, Anna! So happy you enjoyed."
The Crêpe Café,"I've rarely eaten crepes, but this restaurants breakfast crepe made me ache for so much more! Cozy atmosphere but a little cramped. Nonetheless, I'd love to come back for more. ♡"
The Crêpe Café,Thanks so much! See you next time!
The Crêpe Café,"The Crepe Cafe took over the former space of RAVS Ravioli with similar layout, but different offerings. This isn't their first location, the first original shop is at Pier 39. Here, it's all about the crepes from savory to sweet, but clam chowder is being offered at this location. There are couple of counter to regular seating with drawing of SF iconic figures. Nice place to stop by playing tourist or be yourself. Not as close to the real french crepe version, but enough to satisfy your craving."
The Crêpe Café,"I ordered the mixed fruit Nutella crepe and the turkey pesto and they were both awesome! Well made and the ingredients were fresh. I also liked the optional add one of ice cream, chocolate sauce or Dulce de leche sauce for the Nutella crepe. Will definitely hit up this spot again"
The Crêpe Café,"Great food, friendly efficient staff. Clean tables. I ordered the crab salad crepe."
The Crêpe Café,Each crepe is packed with amazing flavors that make each bite wonderful. The portion size is great as well. Totally worth your buck.
The Crêpe Café,Thanks so much for your feedback. So happy you enjoyed!
The Crêpe Café,"Great food and fast service! Had the crab crepe. Delish! Food was ready in less than 10 minutes. (It was 2:20 pm, so not busy.)"
The Crêpe Café,"Variety of tasty crepe selections, and a nice seating area with tables."
The Crêpe Café,I got a chicken avocado crepe that was pretty good and filling.  The place was less busy and expensive than other places in the surrounding area.  Giving them 5 stars in comparison with the options you have in other places in the area
The Crêpe Café,Thank you for your feedback Alfonso and happy to hear you enjoyed your crepe and dining with us!
The Crêpe Café,"The food was excellent, nice spot"
The Crêpe Café,People always forget you can grab a savory crepe for lunch. Great place to avoid long lines at other businesses. Good menu and prices with big filling crepes. Wish the bathroom hadn't been a hike out back.
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you, Kristina!"
The Crêpe Café,"They advertised gluten free crepes on the door, but when we got in, they said they didn’t have enough staff on hand to make them. The other people I was with did like their Nutella and banana crepes."
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for your negative experience with us last year. We appreciate your business and feedback! So sorry you didn’t get out GF crepe that day. Hope you’ll give us another shot next time you’re in the area. Thank you!
The Crêpe Café,Super delicious crepes and garlic fries by the pier.
The Crêpe Café,Thank you for your feedback Roshini!
The Crêpe Café,Nice place with delicious food.
The Crêpe Café,"Awesome place for breakfast, crepe, waffles and Ghirardelli chocs are all delicious. The waffle took a little bit of time to arrive for some reason but didnt bother us."
The Crêpe Café,"Very good crepes. We got the turkey pesto crepe, chicken and crab crepes. The garlic fries were not fresh and were too oily"
The Crêpe Café,"Hi Guarva, Thanks for your feedback. I'll share your comments on the Garlic Fries with my team. Hope you'll visit us again next time you're in the area! Casey"
The Crêpe Café,This is a quality crepe!
The Crêpe Café,"I ordered the mixed fruit crepe. They left out the Nutella that was supposed to be included. The banana was old and brown, and the strawberries tasted like they came from a frozen bag."
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for your negative experience with us in June. Our mixed fruit crepe does not come with Nutella but we should have asked if you wanted to add for $1. We appreciate your business and feedback! Hope you’ll give us another shot next time you’re in the area. Thank you!
The Crêpe Café,"I loved my Savoury Crepe, had almost finished it before I realised I didn't take a picture.... I would definitely head back there when next I'm in San Fran"
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you, Keseina! See you next time :)"
The Crêpe Café,Crepes were cash money. The egg and cheese was spectacular. I was skeptical but it was by far the best breakfast we had on our trip
The Crêpe Café,Cash money! Haha thanks for the review Steve!
The Crêpe Café,The employees took mistakes orders and charged us for the mistakes orders. That’s pretty uncomfortable experience. Never visit here again.
The Crêpe Café,lovely place to have a breakfast at the Fisherman's wharf. Cheese and egg crepe & croissant is beautiful. Also there is waffle with sweet variations.
The Crêpe Café,"Thanks so much, Ilker!"
The Crêpe Café,The crepes were good. Price was fair for the portions.
The Crêpe Café,"They had such an odd variety of things, but it was all incredible and unique in it's own way! Chai tea latte is incredible 10 out of 10 would recommend!"
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you, Machenzie! So happy you enjoyed :)"
The Crêpe Café,Loved the turkey pesto crepe! It was delicious. This was a pleasant surprise. The funnel cake fries are a must!!

The Crêpe Café,"Quick service, good ingredients, just wish they were open in the morning."
The Crêpe Café,Nice enough place to indulge yourself.
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you, Rina!"
The Crêpe Café,Overpriced and aimed at tourists. Eat at restraunts outside of Fisherman's Wharf to get an authentic taste of San Francisco. Visit the Mission neighborhood for Mexican food or try Asian restraunts in the Sunset neighborhood.
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for your negative experience with us. We appreciate your business and feedback! Hope you’ll give us another shot next time you’re in the area. Thank you!
The Crêpe Café,"Neither good nor bad. Ok for a quick bite at lunch time. Not a place for a romantic dinner. If you enjoy traditional French crepes, you'll be disappointed."
The Crêpe Café,"Hi Marc, thank you for your feedback and for dining with us."
The Crêpe Café,"On vacation, the s’more crepe were very good!!! Awesome cappuccino to lift me up from jet lag!!!! Nice clean location!!!! Must try!"

The Crêpe Café,Fantastic crepe and service. Highly recommend the hot chocolate.
The Crêpe Café,Decent fresh food good for a quick meal. Not a ton of flavor but filling.
The Crêpe Café,Nice cozy little cafe. Price is decent. The clam chowder was a lil too salty for my taste.
The Crêpe Café,Thank you for your feedback! I'll share your comments on the chowder with my team. Hope you'll swing by next time you're in the area :)
The Crêpe Café,"the crab and mix in the crepe was very good and delicous, also a new idea"

The Crêpe Café,The crepe  was awesome.
The Crêpe Café,Kinda slow but food was good
The Crêpe Café,"Overpriced food with barely warm, watery 'hot' chocolates, does not live up to 4* rating"
The Crêpe Café,Sorry for your poor experience Mr. Clutterbuck. I assure you we only use whole milk in our hot chocolates unless otherwise requested. We would have gladly remade your beverage to your liking if you had asked. Have a great day.
The Crêpe Café,No sense of queuing if they serve later numbers first. Took 20 minutes to serve my order. Never going to eat here again.
The Crêpe Café,"Sorry for your bad experience Mr. Tingzon. Unfortunately, we have different prep areas and cooks for different items, so sometimes other later numbers will be called first. Everything is made to order so human error can occur. Hopefully you didn't have to wait too long."
The Crêpe Café,Best crepes ever! Very clean and grest service!
The Crêpe Café,Thank you so much for your feedback! Means a lot!
The Crêpe Café,not too sweet and delicious crepes

The Crêpe Café,The waiting time for queuing and picking up meals will not be too long  Mushroom crepes are delicious  Clam chowder + bread is awesome But it's a bit salty  Service staff act quickly  The dining environment has a lot of seating area also considered clean
The Crêpe Café,"Food: ordered a crepe de mushroom (mushroom). The size surprised me positively, being a good meal for one person. It was a little spicy but nothing to scare. I thought the flavor was good, I didn't feel too much salt but I didn't feel a bit of spice either. I think if it was more seasoned it would be better.  Ambiance: the place is very nice. I ended up choosing it also because it had sockets to charge my camera. There are many seats available. Unfortunately there was no wi-fi in the place, which would be a big plus. The music was really good too, eclectic and upbeat. Everything was very clean and organized."
The Crêpe Café,"Thank you, Roger!"
The Crêpe Café,"An okay lunch, nothing special."
The Crêpe Café,"A good restaurant at this, with pancakes rather well supplied and good. Price-performance ratio is ok. Unfortunately, in left period we freeze inside. Hence the 3"
The Crêpe Café,"If you want dulce de leche on a crepe, don't come here. it's a mockery  Response to the owner's response: the first impression is what gives you 5 stars and not trying to fix the problem. As a customer you want to buy your food, sit down, find it delicious and leave the place...the customer never wants to stop and argue in fear that they will spit on the plate they are fixing. I'm sorry but you should talk to your cooks if you want to improve your score, something must happen to them that they don't make the dishes as they should be. I'm not the only one who had problems with her dish. After pleading, they gave me a crepe with more dulce de leche... I make them better at home."
The Crêpe Café,We apologize for your poor experience. I’m sure we would have given you another if you had let us know. We do not intend to disappoint and try to be as reasonable as possible. Thank you.
The Crêpe Café,"Food was very tasty and relatively cheap. The toilets were completely filthy, just disgusting."
The Crêpe Café,Delicious everything they offer there like snow and more delights I recommend that place with family or friends and girlfriends with boyfriends and boyfriends with single girlfriends and singles hehehehe
The Crêpe Café,"The chocolate was very rich, the staff was not all friendly the woman who took the order was not friendly, I would not return"
The Crêpe Café,The crepes are very good and the cashier is very nice.
The Crêpe Café,"The scoops of ice cream are huge, on the other hand the service is not great, no more cones at an ice cream parlor it's still quite surprising, moreover the service leaves something to be desired but I think it's a bit mentality of cafes or restaurants in the United States, the service is frankly not phew, 7.5$, slightly abused, for two scoops in a paper cup. a little internship in Morocco would not hurt you to teach you how to serve customers 😁"
The Crêpe Café,Banana crepe with strawberry and dulce de leche is very tasty.
