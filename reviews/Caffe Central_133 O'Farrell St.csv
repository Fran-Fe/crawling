Caffe Central,"Fantastic place for breakfast, lunch, or brunch! We went here almost every morning for breakfast during our vacation. Everything we ordered was delicious, especially the L’ Amour Crepe. The crepes were sweet and the coffee was wonderful. Thank you for making our trip to San Fran a delight! ☀️"
Caffe Central,"A very hip place for breakfast!  Some amazing breakfast choice for kings! Really enjoy the fresh sandwiches and waffle that they made..very European. very fresh and delicious, Highly recommend the waffle and tea that they have… you won’t me disappoint!  Amazing customer service too.  If you like this honest review, please give me a thumbs up would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you :)"
Caffe Central,"Breakfast and coffee of my dreams. The fruit is so fresh. They make their own whipped cream. You might balk at the coffee's size but it's strong and smooth. Best breakfast I've had in a long time. Good food, good coffee, good atmosphere, reasonable prices. You might not have a place to sit during busy times, so plan ahead. We went on a weekday around 10 am."
Caffe Central,"This is a small cafe located just off Union Square on O‘Farrell Street. It features breakfast options as well as various bakery items. Interestingly, the cafe has its lunch and sandwich options on display on the counter, Japanese style, so you easily can see which option you prefer. We only ordered coffee and fresh juices but the salads and sandwiches looked great.  The cafe is small and has limited seating immediately by the counter where you order. When the weather permits you can also sit outside on a few tables by the street.  The staff is friendly and professional.  The coffee was very good and so were the juices, and we will be coming back for more.  Ambience: 2/5 Staff: 4/5 Coffee: 4/5 Price/quality: 3/5 (pretty pricey)"
Caffe Central,"Decent breakfast before shopping in the square. The space is just way too small, especially for a Saturday crowd. A decent variety of options, and even though they were busy our food was prepared quickly."
Caffe Central,"Friendly and accomplished staff, many tasty options. I came here several times during my stay in San Francisco. One thing I had observed how messy and slightly unsanitary their food prep station is. So when I found a piece of cheese in my waffles ai wasn’t surprised."
Caffe Central,Decent place near union square for a quick cup of coffee. Coffee is better than those you’ll get from Starbucks and there’s seating outside which is a nice place to be when the weather isn’t too hot. There’s food and desserts you can get too and there’s enough seating around for everyone.
Caffe Central,"Ordered the hummus avocado toast, and avocado egg toast. The toast could have been toasted a little more. Nice vibe. Very good coffee. Liked how organized everything was."
Caffe Central,"Amazing location, yummy food options at a fair price. But: A real downer is the food waste they’re causing just because they’re advertising their food at the bar. 👎🏾that’s a no go given the fact there’s so much hunger on earth. …"
Caffe Central,"A must have breakfast and branch place. Everything is super healthy, a huge selection of sugar free and gluten free dishes. Great price range for San Francisco"
Caffe Central,"Discovered this great cafe while visiting SF for a late lunch.  My daughters ordered the crepes with salad. The portions were tasty and filling. The pour over coffee was good, but their pastries are excellent."
Caffe Central,"Great little breakfast spot. Food is tasty and appropriately priced for the portions. I had the Barn Burner, which had very done bacon (ok by me, but not for everyone) and very runny over easy eggs (not ok by me). Runny to the point where they still had pools of uncooked white sitting around the yolk. There isn't a ton of seating in here and it can get crowded. I would go back for lunch, the display sandwiches looked good as well."
Caffe Central,The absolute best place to eat breakfast especially if you want a healthier option!  The absolute best!
Caffe Central,Wish I would have gotten anything else. Tried a salad with chicken and first two bites were cartilage. It was so nasty. Super oily and salty. now I feel sick. I wish I stopped after the first bite 🤢🤢🤢
Caffe Central,"Fantastic menu! Breakfast and lunch is healthy and heaping portions. Fresh Juices & shots, coffee, matcha…I’m in heaven!"
Caffe Central,"Wonderful breakfast.  Spinach and mushroom quiche, breakfast croissant, yogurt bowl with fruit, and smoothies were excellent.  Food was fresh and portions were good. The display of dishes was helpful. Will return the next time I'm in San Francisco."
Caffe Central,"The place is so nice and cheerful, they have a big menu of different selection of food and drinks. They also have a nice outside seating area in front of Maycys. It’s in a nice shopping street. I gave them 3 stars because the coffee wasn’t as good as expected. I will definitely go back but not for coffee 😃"
Caffe Central,"I’ve been going to the Union Square one for a long time. Food is amazing, I just didn’t understand why the skinny lady at the cashier was so mean and careless all the time. But now they have a very friendly and humble  lady that welcomes you and makes you feel like they are happy to have you there! Great food and great staff now. Super recommend it."
Caffe Central,Fantastic place for brunch. Casual and delicious. I had the San Francisco crepe. Totally worth stopping by!
Caffe Central,"The ""Café Trottoir"" French experience at it's best in the heart of san Francisco!  Short Long Story, we were passing by and decided to try the below :  Smoked Chicken Pesto Sandwich & the Smoked Salmon Cucumber Open Face sandwich ! Both were incredibly delicious !  I barely order the same stuff when visiting a place many times, but will definitely do an exception for this place.  Why? ✓ The dough was soft but not sticky. ✓ the freshness of the veggies inside were remarkable. ✓ The portion size is fair. ✓ but most importantly, the blend of tastes in every bite.  Don't miss their savory sweets.  It was such a nice experience there. Definitely visiting again and again!"
Caffe Central,"good food, fast service... thank you"
Caffe Central,Had an American coffee the taste wasn’t good it taste like a coffe from a day before kind of and the coffee mug had a lot of splatters of coffee it didn’t have a good presentation . I Asked the waitress if she could make me a new one she wasn’t friendly at all then she brought another guy which gave me attitude as well and processed to bring me another coffee but it was the same thing as the first one.
Caffe Central,Caffe Central is a good lunch place offering an array of sandwiches and salads. the portions are a good size to leave you full but not stuffed.  They have Mexican Coke and Sprite. French ham and cheese is a good go to.
Caffe Central,Shuffled into this spot because Macy’s Starbucks was closed due to not having water?… 😳… luckily this was much better than Starbucks. Their Chai was rich and creamy and they have oat milk for those of us that don’t do cow-breast feeding. And the waffle is perfectly fluffy the way I like them. Prompt service makes it a good quick sit-down spot as well. Seems to be mostly tourists but this is one place I’d return to as a local.
Caffe Central,"Great breakfasts… during my stay in SF, I had my breakfast here almost all mornings. There are good options. They are busy, specially during weekends, and you may need to wait to find a seat."
Caffe Central,"Disappointing. Pastries tasted old and latte was just as disappointing. We went to a lot of really great cafes in SF, this one got good reviews so we had reasonably good expectations. Choc hazelnut cake and tres leche cake were tasteless and stale. I dont know how you mess up a latte but it happened. Then at the end we asked an employee for a box and got a rudely spoken response that she doesn’t do that and to go to the register. Register had a long line and it was a very simple ask. We got our left overs to go but ended up trashing it on the way back to the hotel. Not worth the sugar and calories to keep. Unfortunate. Maybe we were the “one offs” and you will have a better experience."
Caffe Central,There are *so many* options here. Eat-in is easier than to-go since they will give you a number for your table and bring the order out as it is ready.
Caffe Central,At first seemed pricey but the portions are huge! Bagels and sabdwiches are delicious and they come with fruit bowl or salad on the side. Recommended.
Caffe Central,"Desserts are great. Variety of Desserts, coffee, and teas. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Can get crowded because it’s in a busy area."
Caffe Central,"Absolutely love the coffee here! Better than Starbucks, made fresh per order by the barista right in front of you, and the baked goods are great too. Visited here a week and have been here 3 times already, way better than other local chains and National chains alike! I recommend the central latte!"
Caffe Central,"Quite good selection of teas and coffee drinks, good food and breakfast options.  Would be nice if they had the ceramic cups better cleaned/washed (yes, the teas leave specific marks, but nothing that cannot be solved with proper dishwasher and dishwasher detergent IMHO) - see photo"
Caffe Central,"I love this place. Excellent service and great deli sandwiches and salads which make it the perfect lunch drop in. Fun mix of local workers, shoppers, and tourists, just like the olden times 😉. Lots of windows, nice and airy. Love the open kitchen. My go to in Union Square."
Caffe Central,"Saw some good reviews, thought I’d give it a try. The server/cashier wasn’t friendly at all. Asked her for a recommendation for dessert, and she gave a few suggestions half heartedly. In the end I picked tiramisu (which admittedly wasn’t what she suggested), and it’s the worst I’ve ever had. It’s so stale, it tasted like it’s been sitting there for days. I usually don’t leave food behind, but I just couldn’t bring myself to finish it. Says a lot. Ordered a cappuccino as well- it’s fine, nothing to rave about. Overall- I’m just disappointed."
Caffe Central,"Nice Food, but waited more than 30 min for the coffee - so got it way after the breakfast..."
Caffe Central,"Small little almost European sandwich shop with some amazing offerings, salads, sandwiches, deserts and coffee.  Perfect for a light morning or afternoon bite. 🥰"
Caffe Central,Best breakfast in area! Especcialy bagels!!
Caffe Central,"Good coffee, excellent breakfast (avocado toast and another type) . Service is a little confusing as not sure what is brought to the table (food) and what u should go pick up (tea). Lunch Salad (dirty bird) was ok. Charles Barkley stopped by which was nice 🙂"
Caffe Central,"Enjoyed the Barn Burner (2 eggs up, bacon, waffle) and fresh orange juice. Nice diner-type experience, I even sat at the counter."
Caffe Central,"Would highly recommend this place.  Lots of food and drink choices.  While we were 4 days in San Francisco, we went to breakfast every morning.  Everything is fresh, good atmosphere"
Caffe Central,"Update 4/12/2022 Today I went again and the front door is fairly clean.  ——  Pretty limited space... but because it's SF so it's reasonable. With that, they have surprisingly lots of seats, hard to imagine in such a small space.  The food is decent and generous. Sample placed next to the cashier so you can see their signature dish and menu.  A little messy and dirty esp at the front door though. People came in and out, one spilled his entire cup of coffee, the staff seems super busy and didn't come clean it up so the spill is there for a long time (at least 20min). Hope people dodge it otherwise you'll have these dirty taints all over the place.  Internet wise the cellular signal was ok. I'm using TMobile, 60 Mbps enough for work.  Overall despite of some hassle, I was still able to settle in a seat, get my work done. Considering the hassle nature in SF, I'd probably come again if I'm around and need to find a spot to work."
Caffe Central,"Very unique breakfast menu of quality food choices that appeal to a wide range of tastes.  The coffee choices are good as well.  Very clean, efficient and professional staff in a clean and well kept facility."
Caffe Central,One of the best places to get coffee and a pastry in Union Square area. Everything I had was very yummy.
Caffe Central,"Iced Cuban coffee is always so good I enjoyed the avocado toast I just think they stack it wayyy too much I took a bite out of it and all the avocado and bacon fell off as well as the greens they use to top it, disappointing bc avocado toast is expensive and I ended up spilling it all over the table :/ overall the breakfast looks yummy there id try the rest, also their French pastries are whole sale from cafe madeleine"
Caffe Central,Food was good but far too expensive
Caffe Central,"Best coffee i had in SF! The place is nothing fancy, but the food is fresh and good. Coffee is so much better than other downtown cafes!"
Caffe Central,"Little hole-in-the-wall place with surprisingly large menu. Ordered a Cortado (off menu) which was good, and a tasty decaf mocha with little discernable added sugar. Has a lot of cold drinks and pastries as well as a a crepe and others breakfasts menu."
Caffe Central,"Got a latte and crepe to go, basically uncooked. Won’t be back"
Caffe Central,"Tried the Nutella crepe and it was absolutely delicious. Really great presentation, perfect amount of Nutella filling and it was cooked perfectly. Little on the expensive side for just a single crepe but it was quite large so in my opinion it was worth it."
Caffe Central,Out of croissants but baguette was good with egg and spinach breakfast sandwich. Staff all very nice and accommodating - they made me plain toast and it was perfect!
Caffe Central,"If I could give 0 stars, I would do it. Waiting time approx one hour, seems like they lost the order. Nothing as an excuse. Worst café in SF!"
Caffe Central,Coffee hand brewed cup by cup 😀 And real flatware and silverware (almost no plastics)! A little bit like home 🇩🇪. We enjoyed one of our best breakfast during our 3 weeks USA trip. Thank you very much!
Caffe Central,"If I could give this place a 0, I would! Literally my worst experience at a cafe. I ordered orange juice and a L'Amour crepe: 1) my juice had an insect or fly, after notifying one of the persons there, they replaced the juice after a lot of time! I couldn't stay longer in the place so I took the ""new"" glass of orange juice to go. When I arrived home, I notice this glass has also an insect inside! And it has a lot of black dirty type of things at the bottom of the cup. Soooo disgusting! 2) the L'Amour crepe was also not good. The crepe consistency was way too hard. The harder I've ever had! Really with the juice experience is enough to not ever go back to this place. I can't imagine they preparing something clean when not even their juices are as such."
Caffe Central,"Had crepes and coffee.   Delicious cappuccino,  but the crepes were bland and too thick.  There were a lot of options though,  better than most places I have seen.   Would definitely go back to try something else."
Caffe Central,The food was terrible. I'm sure it's still a good place for coffee or pastries but I wouldn't recommend eating here as a meal to anybody
Caffe Central,Food quality is always great. When it gets packed it gets really loud because of the location and its surroundings. Be sure to speak up and lean in and double check that they have your name and order right. Always great customer service.
Caffe Central,Very tasty! Lots of great options.  Sampled several and all tasty. Great coffee.
Caffe Central,This is my go to breakfast spot in San Francisco- I get the croque madam and a Cuban coffee every time.  Not to mention the staff is extremely friendly. Love this place- highly recommended!
Caffe Central,"Nice place for coffee abd small bite. They have a good varaity of Corazon, cakes, sandwiches and waffles. You can seat at high chairs (9) or at a two seat table (5)."
Caffe Central,"My favorite breakfast spot in the area. Great variety of dishes, as well as bakery items. Also great for lunch."
Caffe Central,"Delicious, fresh food and amazing teas and coffees! So much care is put into preparation. Highly recommend!"
Caffe Central,"Great food, decent prices, and good atmosphere. The people are friendly with quick service, and the areas are clean."
Caffe Central,"Great food and staff, great prices too"
Caffe Central,"This cost $12!!  2 eggs, a quarter avocado and 2 sad toast halves. Do not order the “union square” it’s a total rip off, even by San Francisco prices.  The woman behind the counter listened to my complaint and added more toast and avocado which was nice. But I’m leaving it at 2 stars because it’s management that are setting these prices and menus."
Caffe Central,"Espresso was weak and bitter. Lox bagel was very basic and bland. Quality you would expect from a hotel breakfast. Service was good, but not good enough to make it worth the money. Go next door to one65 instead, much better EVERYTHING."
Caffe Central,Great place to have a good breakfast on the go!! Avocado bacon toast is delicious and omelette’s fresh made it!!
Caffe Central,So good!
Caffe Central,"To quote my wife ""all you could want in this life."" Food was great, we loved it."
Caffe Central,"Food was tasty, good breakfast spot. They forgot a part of the order, but it was easily fixed."
Caffe Central,"Good selection of food and deserts. Lattes are very good. Has a restroom. Opposite Macy's and close to Westfields, Bart/Mooney lines and the Cable Car."
Caffe Central,"We had a light lunch, sandwiches made with a bagel and a croissant stuffed with vegetables... They were delicious! We ate them at a table on the street, great for people-watching... On the down side the lady who took our order seemed to have a personal grudge against the card reader machine, she just couldn't make it work, we eventually paid cash, and the food took an awful long to arrive. But we forgot all that when the food, at last, arrived."
Caffe Central,Waffle with fruit was delicious! Small place with limited seating.
Caffe Central,"I needed to use the customer restroom but when I asked to use it, the staff said that its occupied. I waited and waited but no one came out. I then saw a staff member using a key to open the ""occupied"" restroom. They just kept it locked and didn't want me to use the restroom, even though I was a paying customer. Pathetic and prejudiced management/staff."
Caffe Central,Seriously delightful. They have excellent pour over coffee and delicious pastry options.
Caffe Central,Great food/coffee at a reasonable price. Good for breakfast 👌🏻
Caffe Central,Very nice service. Good food and nice coffee
Caffe Central,Really good coffee and food is amazing!
Caffe Central,! Bad quality tarts taste like refrigerator and moldy . Super expensive . 7$ for  piece of tart and rude waiters. Would never go back there ever . Big disappointment
Caffe Central,Great coffee and cosy place to have coffee or breakfast.
Caffe Central,Tasty salad and pour over coffee. Also good that they have outdoor seating.
Caffe Central,Had a flat white and a chocolate/hazelnut croissant.. Absolutely the best coffee I've had for years and the croissant was incredible
Caffe Central,Perfect location for shopping and parking lots in the heart of San Francisco. Love the French pastries here.
Caffe Central,"Pretty good salad, quick service, nice atmosphere."
Caffe Central,"Very good Cafe for breakfast and lunch. Coffee brewed is very good. Sandwiches and crepes are great. However, becareful with the hords of people waiting for their food. It was too crowded and we waited for 1 hour for the sandwich. We got the coffee in 10mins though. Coffee got cold until breakfast was ready and they don't refill. Overall, our nerve wracking experience was somehow over after eating the yummy sandwich."
Caffe Central,Nice bagel and good crepe. They also serve hot chocolate if you are fed up with coffee and tea for breakfast.
Caffe Central,Great espresso if your are looking for Italian style coffee
Caffe Central,Food was delicious. The ambience could be better as it's a small place.
Caffe Central,Absolutely delicious and generous amount of food for your money. Service was quick and friendly.  Will definitely be back.
Caffe Central,Looking at the review I expected much better taste of bubble tea. I had better bubble teas and this one did not met my expectations and taste.  I would recommend not to try bubble tea from this place  I'm only giving my ratings for bubble tea
Caffe Central,"Al fresco streetwise, or inside, great display of available entrees, fast service....worth the extra calories."
Caffe Central,"The espresso tastes burnt here. Very disappointed with the low quality drink. At first sip of the large mocha, I found myself needing more chocolate, sweetness, and espresso.. did they even make the drink? After the third shot, I discovered why I couldn’t pinpoint flavor as the shot tasted burnt. I am not happy with my drink.. I say Starbucks is better and coming from me.. that means something as most my reviews are coffee shops. They do offer gluten free bread so I was happy and excited to have a breakfast too. Their pastry case contains some gluten free options as well to pair something sweet with savory. I enjoyed their salmon and avocado toast with a lemon almond cake. The food here is much better than the espresso. The stars are for the food, I can’t give 3 stars because the drink is disgusting."
Caffe Central,I did not like the food here. I had a pancake which was very dry and tasteless. Coffee was okay. The waitress was not friendly to me.
Caffe Central,Delicious coffee and breakfast! The fruit and veggies in our meals were so fresh!!!
Caffe Central,Awesome food and prompt service. Stumbled upon this place taking a walk for breakfast. Even great gluten free and healthier options.
Caffe Central,"Good quick breakfast, with good healthy options and nice coffee."
Caffe Central,"So delicious the first time we went back again. Ordering at the counter is a wonderful idea because you can see all the amazing options in the case. We went for breakfast and tried the Nutella waffles, spinach quiche, breakfast bagel, and breakfast croissant. All were amazing! The espresso drinks were perfect. Friendly staff and ample seating inside. Will definitely go back for dessert when we are back in town."
Caffe Central,So yummy! The avocado toast was delicious. There was space to sit
Caffe Central,"Pretty good coffee, the food was excellent... The service.... Meh?!?! Seemed more like a bother than anything else. You don't need to make me feel special, I am in the service industry and fully understand people can wear you out. But you COULD make people feel welcomed. I liked the iced mocha not being too chocolaty or sweet, it allowed for the coffee to taste like it. And the chicken club sandwich was really tasty. Check 'em out!!!"
Caffe Central,Staff is personable and kind. I enjoy getting my morning coffee here.
Caffe Central,"Below average breakfast, I ordered an Egg & Avocado and it was a disappointment."
Caffe Central,"Don’t go there! It’s written « your favorite coffe is back. Thank you for your support ». This place could be very nice if it was not for its employees. No education, no customer care, no smile, not even a look when talking to the customer. The worst was the woman « cashier » this morning 30/5."
Caffe Central,"Egg and Spanish croissant served on a bagel, it was soft and bland, just okay. I felt like I was inconvenience to staff when asked about coffee (pour over). Cozy and clean enough space."
Caffe Central,"Such a fantastic place, we went in there just because it was in the parking garage we had parked in and to our surprise we had such tasty fresh food. The drinks are so refreshing and you will know they are made from fresh fruit in the first sip! We had ‘yoga relax’ and ‘super entertainer’ fruit juices. The tomato mozzarella sandwich, the fruit waffle and the la la..crepe were delicious. They have a wide variety of food, fresh fruit juices and beverages options."
Caffe Central,"While visiting San Fran, stumbled upon this small little cafe. Came in for some coffee, ended up getting an amazing breakfast instead. I absolutely loved their Vietnamese Coffee and Salmon Sandwich😋 Everything was super delicious!!!"
Caffe Central,"I had the Mediterranean bowl to go , asked no onions. When I got home, I’d gotten onions, and just loads of spinach, hardly anything else. Very disappointed"
Caffe Central,Wow this place rocks!!! The broccoli cheddar quiche is amazing. I had both days of my trip. The cold brew coffee is great too.
Caffe Central,"I really appreciate their attention to detail. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, coffee. No frills, no bills, no whistles, just coffee done right."
Caffe Central,Seems like a nice place with good seating! I had the blueberry danish and a crepe and would recommend both!
Caffe Central,Great coffee and great deserts
Caffe Central,"Waited 30min for a piece of Burnt toast with tomato, avocado, cheese, & very BURNT bacon.... Ridiculous for $14 they weren't busy when I came in but it got busy as I waited. Coffee was good, cashier was mehh...."
Caffe Central,"Great food, excellent service and friendly employees! Sit comfortable! Love the place"
Caffe Central,"The one star is for being a business. Otherwise, terrible watered down latte, crepe couldn't even be cut with a knife, and prices were similar to everywhere else. Not sure how they stay in business with the competitive quality in this city. The strawberries in the crepe were good."
Caffe Central,"Amazing pastries and range of coffees plus a tasty breakie menu. Just near union square, and there is great service here."
Caffe Central,My Goto cafe for artisian coffee (soy latte) around the union square district. Food looks nice and healthy but didn't try.
Caffe Central,Very knowledgeable coffee pros that know how brew some great pour over coffee.
Caffe Central,A big variety of breakfast choices and could be clearly seen on the counter. Friendly staff provided suggestions for a breakfast! The coffee is average though.  I would definitely come for a breakfast there again!
Caffe Central,"Good cappuccino, fair price. Easy in/out."
Caffe Central,Place is super cute! All of their food looks delicious. I had the Oh La La. It's a crepe filled with bananas & strawberries then topped with caramel sauce. We will be back!
Caffe Central,"I had the cappuccino and a pastry. Both were excellent, but the cappuccino was tiny, served in a tea cup rather than coffee cup. They had normal size mugs for other coffee types, I saw them. They couldn’t give a straight answer when I asked why the cappuccino is so tiny. I had to buy an additional pour-over coffee to get my usual morning dose. Total paid just for coffee: $8. Overall total: $17."
Caffe Central,"Bad service, a person at the counter could answer a single question and was really gloomy as if she was made to work(( we waited for our order for 40 min!!!! Though they said it would take 15-20 min. The manager was extremely rude. The food was really good."
Caffe Central,"Food is good, but way too much people Saturday morning, as a result the service is terrible. I received my coffee 15 minutes after my breakfast, which is totally unacceptable."
Caffe Central,The Best Coffee! The best food! and fantastic service
Caffe Central,"Food was very nice, amazing vietnamese coffee"
Caffe Central,"The food and coffee were great. The reason for my 3 stars is because my bill was $26, I tipped in cash, and when it posted in my account, the amount was $30. I’m guessing they went in and added their own gratuity. Not cool…"
Caffe Central,"Hello Arvada, Would you mind e-mailing me the transaction date and the last 4 digits of your credit card? I will take a look and make any necessary adjustments. I apologize for the inconvenience. info@caffecentral.com"
Caffe Central,Service was quite slow. They don't enforce the mask policy. I wish I knew how their food was.  Update: I got the food. The eggs were out of a box. Inedible. I would avoid this place.
Caffe Central,"This was one of the most satisfying breakfast meals and espresso drinks I’ve had in awhile when traveling between cities.  I got the mushroom and spinach crepe which might sound a tad plain, but the feta they use is fantastic, and the mushrooms are wonderful.  Perfect balance of filling and crepe, and it’s served with a side of salad that adds a nice, subtle citrus note because of the dressing.  Peaceful enough place to eat with large windows all around to watch street traffic. Nice staff.  Liked it so much I came two days in a row while in San Fran for the week!"
Caffe Central,Delicious egg toast and wonderful drinks. Love the environment too!
Caffe Central,We had the butternut quiche and Dirty bird salad
Caffe Central,if you can get a table outside then you'll probably have a good time. it's just beside Macy's a perfect spot to rest and sip coffee and talk. the coffee and pastries are good. will definitely come back.
Caffe Central,Waited in a long line to order expensive items. The oj was fresh squeezed but they must use low quality fruit because it tasted terrible.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was nearly 30min before they asked if I was waiting on something. I decided to just get my money refunded.
Caffe Central,"The avocado toast is very okay, but it’s still one of the healthiest places to eat in around there!"
Caffe Central,"$11 simple sandwiches would have been fine, but served on old bread. Took 25 minutes to get them."
Caffe Central,Great place to grab delicious breakfast! Friendly stuff and fast service! Highly recommend!
Caffe Central,Stopped by for breakfast during Dreamforce. Limited crowd vs any of the mediocre and packed Starbucks in the area. A delicious drip coffee and waffle were enough to bring me back 2 more times before leaving the city. Great pastries and breakfast sandwiches.  Topped off with very friendly service.
Caffe Central,"Had a smoked turkey panini and a pour over coffee. The coffee was great, handcrafted cup by cup. The panini bread was really soft and a good one altogether. I would have given 5 stars but for the lady at the cash register.She did not sound welcoming and was on the short on conversation and politeness. The lady making the coffee was more welcoming with a smile."
Caffe Central,"Very disappointed, breakfast experience was very poor. Ordered two Denver Omelettes, the size of the omelettes were like for kids. Paid 45 dollars including 15% tips and left hungry. Never again. After this ‘breakfast’ just went to the ONE 65 next door to eat something else."
Caffe Central,"Coffee is quite excellent, the owner knows his roasts, and the baristas will customize as needed. The variety of breakfast options is great. I used to go to Blue Bottle every day; but now I mostly visit here. Side note: this place is 10x better than Cafe Madelaine down the street. That's how I found it - I threw away the ""cappuccino"" I was made at Madelaine and on my way home saw this place and gave it a try.  Why not 5? Normal caps are awesome. The soy cappuccino, however, came with thick milk that was undrinkable and probably almost expired - plz swap your milk faster. The salmon sandwich is fine, but better if bread was toasted, and where is a bun or bagel option? Finally, there's no ""waiting"" area, so when the seats are filled, waiting can be awkward."
Caffe Central,Food was just okay. The reason I’m giving 1 star is because the tables were not clean. And what look to be the manager was doing absolutely nothing. If you want your customer to have a better experience let’s start with cleaning the tables. Maybe this is what people from SF are use to...
Caffe Central,This review is only for the potato chips. My mom bought a small bag to bring over. They looked delicious in the clear cellophane. But they were so stale that they're inedible. Please date and seal your goods well before selling.
Caffe Central,"Excellent coffee, hand made fresh lunches to go or stay, and a fantastic selection of infused teas. Everything here is well thought out. Great staff, very friendly. Get to be a regular, it will improve your whole work week."
Caffe Central,OMG the Light Breakfast was the best with the Sunnyside Up Eggs with the Bacon. Bomb.com🤙😁🙌🌼🌺 my lady and I loved it. Definitely coming back for more on the regular. …
Caffe Central,"OMG!  Amazing coffee, beverages, location and aesthetics. The barista really creates every cup artistically and that is what makes this place a gem in SF. You pay for delicious bright and absolutely tasty dishes. I look forward to visiting again soon."
Caffe Central,"Good place for a quick coffee, probably not the best around but definitely more than decent and it has better opening hours than most."
Caffe Central,"Overpriced. Had the ""Life Eater"", described as a local favourite. Priced at around $10. It was basically two eggs, one white toast and a few strips of bacon, garnished with 1 slice of orange cut in half. Nothing special about this place..."
Caffe Central,"Good breakfast,lunch and coffee. Reasonably priced. Try the turkey, bacon, avocado and cheese sandwich."
Caffe Central,I'd give them a zero star for thier customer service. We went in there to buy a snack and my father who is a diabetic asked to use the restroom while I waited to make a purchase. The manager refused to give him the bathroom code even though I was clearly waiting in line. They had a 60 year old man openly begging to use the restroom in front of the whole restaurant. Completely humiliating. I'll never step foot in there again. They don't deserve to be in business if they can't treat people with dignity.
Caffe Central,"Wow, this place is totally amazing. The food is great, try it you won't be disappointed."
Caffe Central,"Ample seating, friendly, good coffee, a little pricey. I had the lox bagel, toasted, which resulted in all the ingredients being heated - was not expecting that. It's was pretty good just the same."
Caffe Central,Good place - had the Denver omlette - crowded and cramped.  Food and coffee were excellent.  About a 10-15 minute wait for the omlette - coffee was ready in about 5 minutes. Friendly staff - clean but a bit cramped.
Caffe Central,THE BEST QUICHE I've ever had. The potato and leek quiche. It was so light even though eggs which always makes it so heavy. The pastry itself was well cooked and made. I would eat an entire quiche pie if I could.
Caffe Central,I had the awesomest sandwich here. All the baked goods and sandwiches were on display and looked to be a step above what I am accustomed to at other places. If this place was my neighborhood I'd be there all the time.
Caffe Central,"Good sandwich, excellent bread, terrible service. Whilst paying the cashiers was texting on her phone. Guess what? Zero tip."
Caffe Central,Always very full which speaks for the good food. Ordering may take some time but you get good meals
Caffe Central,"Joint to get quick meal fix, snacks, coffee and bubble tea.  Was searching hard for a cafe to hang for a couple of hours before my next appointment. Wanted something other than the Starbucks, Peets and Coffee bean.  Located right opposite Macy, an easy spot to reach and grab a quick bite before heading to your next destination.  I got myself an apple strudel and a bubble tea (black tea with coconut and peach flavoring plus boba), cost me about $12.  It's a small cafe catering to mostly take out customers. I was here at 2+ in the afternoon and the traffic is regular and noisy. Not a place you want to be if you want some peace and quiet or to get some work done.  The strudel was not fantastic, was edible. The bubble tea was way too sweet for my liking.  They have limited seating. Not recommended for big groups unless it's a grab and go. I was alone but still ended up at the bar counters with painful screeching stools.  And oh plus point, a restroom at the back. They look like they have free wifi, didn't ask for it since I have data.  Overall, good place to stop for a quick bite."
Caffe Central,Ooops... didn't realize the lox bagel had egg in it! 😥 usually lox bagels dont have egg... that was the only surprise for me... but overall this place has a GREAT menu and a great selection of baked goods... maybe more plants??? More positive energy from plants since its in the busy and chaotic city... greenery helps. 😊 …
Caffe Central,"Best cup of coffee in the city. Excellent food, my go to place when in SF. The owner is on premises and manages a great team. Get the frequent patron card because you WILL be back!"

Caffe Central,"Amazing crepes, we could have breakfast here every day and be happy"
Caffe Central,Really good lunches.
Caffe Central,"I thought I'd try a smaller shop over Star_ucks, and ordered a regular coffee to go.  I don't know if they offer machine brewed coffee, but they charged me $3.95 for a small individual drip coffee.  The barista poured water from a teapot into a individual cone dripper and I waited and waited.   The coffee came out barely hot, not boiling hot like I prefer.  If you like a small, kinda hot coffee with a side of wait, come here."
Caffe Central,"Urbanish decor and the fine aroma's welcome you to this corner caffe right next to a parking deck in the heart of Union Square. Coffee's - splendid, must try the pour overs Breakfast - options are aplenty, sizeable portions and healthy"
Caffe Central,"The cafe offers coffees, teas, bubble teas, fresh juices, smoothies, sandwiches and pastries. But this review is just for the $3 single-cup drip coffee. The coffee was strong and good. I would come by for another cup if I'm in the area."
Caffe Central,Awesome food and coffee selection. Smoothies as well. Great place for lunch too.
Caffe Central,"Amazing coffee, great sandwiches, and fresh juices. Enough said! Went here every morning during our stay in SF and I still miss it."

Caffe Central,I would like to give my big thank you for those 2 Filipino lady who works every morning in o'farell.  They both make the best Thai iced tea and flavored teas. They were always nice and accomadating everytime me and my family were coming in O'Farrell. It's always nice to come back because of them. Forgot their names but both of them has long hair and you won't miss them.
Caffe Central,"Not kind peple, Not tasty sandwiches. I bought the avocado sandwiches and there were few avocado in it. Also it was not tasty. I don’t understand why it is 7 dollors.. Maybe the others are good as I hope."

Caffe Central,"We found the café by accident and had breakfast a little late. My roast beef baguette was delicious. The staff are very friendly. We'll probably be back tomorrow. Really good and something different compared to the ""typical"" American (greasy :)) breakfast. The price is also absolutely fine. Have paid a lot more here in the US. I can't report on sticky tables either."
Caffe Central,"We had breakfast there, it was good but priced a bit high. The coffee and tea are very good! The waitress was quite unpleasant, being French, she made no effort to articulate and ensure that we understood each other"
Caffe Central,"Summary: It was not crazy at all. Tldr: I had to do the service myself because the staff was incompetent.  Long version: we arrive at three for a brunch around 11am. We sit on the terrace, at the last free table. There were still the dishes of the people before, but hey, we tell ourselves that they are going to get rid of them. Nobody comes for 15', during this time we go inside to order. I had a Barn Burner, which seems to be one of their signature dishes, and an espresso.  The server arrives with our dishes and puts them in the middle of the empty dishes of the previous customers, then leaves. When told it wasn't ours, he shrugs and turns around. When we finally manage to find a waiter who wants to get rid of us, I get my espresso, and the cup was disgusting. Really dirty (see photo). With dust all around. Of course, when I mention this to the waiter, he shrugs again and points at the barista. When I talk to him about it, he snatches the cup from my hands, without a word, and makes me an espresso again in an even dirtier cup (!) (See photo the other). In short, I gave up.  The dishes are expensive and really 4/10 good. The espresso was lousy. The technique and the coffee looked good, but I don't feel like they clean their machine, outside and inside.  And I'm not going to tell you about my buddy's adventures to get the caramel on his pancake, which he had paid for."
Caffe Central,Very good coffee. Generous and very tasty portions.
Caffe Central,"Best breakfast bagel of our tour of the western United States! It is particularly nice that you can also get some fruit. And the yoghurt with fruit and granola is also highly recommended. The filter coffee is more for heart patients, but the caffe latte is quite decent.  There is also a hummus and avocado sandwich - looked great but isn't for breakfast for me.  The place is very popular and busy, so come early to get a table or take breakfast away and enjoy the hotel in peace."
Caffe Central,"This cafe is a little paradise. Cakes, fruit juices, hot / cold drinks, salads, sandwiches, pancakes, waffles..etc Everything is very good, no wonder it's crowded!"
Caffe Central,Fast and diverse food. A good breakfast.
Caffe Central,"Excellent value for money, the quiche lorraine, good. The crepe l'amour, large and with a lot of nutella."
Caffe Central,Neither good nor bad But as a tourist I wouldn't go back. Better to explore somewhere else
Caffe Central,Delicious sandwiches and the cold Cuban or Vietnamese coffee is a delight. A bit expensive but worth it
Caffe Central,Very good brunch breakfasts and well priced. Accompanied with natural fruit. The bagels are very good. Highly recommended
Caffe Central,Super tasty and everything super fresh. Perfect for a good start to the day.
Caffe Central,"Excellent place for breakfast, delicious food."
Caffe Central,"I ate cheesecake, but the tart I ate last time was better. I ate the cheesecake but I like a tart better than the cheesecake."
Caffe Central,"DAMN tastier crepes. They may not be French crepes but they speak really great words on their own. The coffee there is also extremely aromatic and I think the quality is really great. However, I am not a coffee connoisseur. But I would recommend it to everyone."
Caffe Central,"The food is really good, but a lot of it is very expensive. Over $10 for a juice is not justified. Tables are sticky and not very clean."
Caffe Central,"Very good place, fresh products, homemade. We took brunch plates (waffles, very good pancakes), pastries ~ nothing to complain about. We found the staff friendly and the atmosphere cheerful. I recommend."
Caffe Central,Very good! Several healthy options. Very tasty coffee. Simple but good place. There is always a place and it is well located.
Caffe Central,Rich!! But a disorganization in the employees
Caffe Central,Super good and great staff. I recommend both the breakfast and the salmon bagel.
Caffe Central,A place to have a cheap and hearty breakfast compared to the price of San Fran
Caffe Central,Very good experience to taste a coffee
Caffe Central,Very good 😊 👍 Coffee very tasty and the food too. Almond Croissants 😋 I can only recommend a visit to everyone! Everything very freshly prepared.
Caffe Central,"Very good crepes and baguette sandwiches…. Always freshly made, so bring some time with you. Coffee and fresh juices very good. Worth it 👍👍🤩🤩"
Caffe Central,"We ordered a waffle and toast to be brought to us at once, while the attendant played on the mobile (cell) phone there were no napkins outside. 25 minutes after the waffle the toast arrives, I ask for it to take away and surprise! It is not what we had ordered. We ask him to return the money for that toast and we leave. We ignore the fees... And the inconvenience of taking more than 40 minutes for a $45 breakfast that neither your desire in front of the public, nor enthusiasm, nor product is worth more than $20. Nothing recommendable since in San Francisco there are a thousand more authentic places and with people who like their work..."
Caffe Central,"A tip from a best friend. Great healthy morning meal. A bit busy in the morning. But if you have a good reputation, you also have a full house."
Caffe Central,I went to pick up the car in the parking lot next to it. I passed by and saw the cake inside was very tempting. I went in without knowing it. The taste is really good. It is worth thinking about trying it when you have nothing to do🥰
Caffe Central,"Cool café with nice service, few tourists and many locals. Right near Union Square. Prices are ok too. $4 for a really good cappuccino. There is hardly anything cheaper in the middle of San Francisco. Free wifi. Hot breakfast, salads, sandwiches, bagels, quiche... Great!"
