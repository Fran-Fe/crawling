Milk-SF,"Nice place to hang out. Good iced latte; however, no sugar-free flavors available. Smoothie was quite good. Vegan BLT, not so much."
Milk-SF,Delicious breakfast sandwich (had the baby trans with bacon) and really good coffee and smoothies. Chill atmosphere and the folks working are really friendly.
Milk-SF,"Milk SF is a wonderful new cafe that opened up right by four barrel, thus providing the community another lovely option!  The coffee is excellent - I went for the maple iced latte to get just a touch of sweet - and my friend got the iced Americano. The vibe was great with plenty of interesting art. And great service!  Would 5/5 recommend this place next time you’re in the Mission!"
Milk-SF,"Delicious bagels, excellent service, and a very comfortable atmosphere!! I'm definitely going back there next time I'm in town."
Milk-SF,"Super delicious bagels from Boichik and other great food. Coffee isn’t third wave, it’s queer-wave, in this ultra queer-friendly space."
Milk-SF,Amazing queer safe space in the Mission. Lots of really great queer merch too! Support your local queer spaces!!
Milk-SF,"Cute cafe, dropped in solely cuz I read they carry Boichik bagels! Fyi they keep them frozen (and toast them to order) so if you’re looking for a fresh untoasted Boichik bagel you still gotta trek out to Berkeley. If you enjoy toasted bagels you’ll love this spot! And they use a really high quality cream cheese.  Got two bagels w/ cream cheese and a 16oz pb cup nitro latte that they make in house $19 total. The flavors change on the nitro and they offer two versions, one with whole milk and the other with oat milk. Staff was helpful and kind, and all the cute knickknacks they sell are locally made."
Milk-SF,Hi! Just wanted to share that fresh bagel day is fridays and sundays for those that want them fresh and Un-toasted. 👍 thanks for the kind review glad you enjoyed yourself!
Milk-SF,"super funky and cozy, had a nice time admiring the art and eating a bagel with cream cheese. a little expensive, but im happy to spend my money on quality ingredients at a queer cafe.. will have to try an actual sandwich next time!  only thing i would change is the setup - furniture placement makes the flow/use of the space a little awkward"
Milk-SF,Amazing!! My girlfriend and I got the marshmallow lattes iced with the vegan breakfast sandwich. SO GOOD.  Service was wonderful and the atmosphere is so welcoming and has so much character. We can’t wait to come back! 🏳️‍🌈🫶🏻
Milk-SF,Had a delicious Boichik bagel with vegan schmear and other toppings. A tad pricey but worth it! Super cool queer space with chill vibes too.
Milk-SF,"Ngl wasn’t a huge fan of the coffee, however, the bagel sandwich (the werks) was great. Would be happy to go there again for it! Also, a pretty unique atmosphere that’s worth a stop."
Milk-SF,The most watered down hot chocolate and burnt tasting coffee I've had in San Francisco. The hot chocolate was not hot...it was warm and was chocolate flavored soy milk and was pricey. The coffee was so terrible that it was thrown out. The Poppyseed muffin was dry and tasted like it was over a day old.The shop walls are an unflattering murky  color of green and there is way too much merchandise on the cluttered floor with a dying plant in a plant stand. The walls are plastered with giant photos and art.Nothing about it made me want to stay and eat and drink. I felt dizzified by it all and couldn't wait to leave.Very disappointing. The only good thing was that the bathroom is spacious and clean.
Milk-SF,"Soo excited to welcome Milk to the neighborhood!  The coffee is tasty with  lots of different variations.  Love this artistic, colorful and inclusive cafe with many vegan and gluten-free treats too; options like this just signals that this isn’t just about being a queer friendly and open space, it’s for everyone."
Milk-SF,Coffee was fine but no wifi?!? Especially when cell reception was horrible. Cool vibes though...
Milk-SF,"Love this cafe. Excellent bagel and egg sandwich, and lovely service. Perfect place to write and do some reading."
Milk-SF,+Great bagel and coffees ☕️ +Atmosphere is perfect (design and music)  -There is no wifi -Indoor siting is not that convenient
Milk-SF,"This place is quite nice. It's new so they are still filling out the rough spots. I ordered an iced tea preferably strong. The teller responded that  ""they really do not have like a strong tea just yet, but I can put some black tea on ice for you.""🤨I really didn't care either way I was just in there to check it out for the first time since it's right by my place. Very cute place. Will get better in time. Must check out the shirts when you visit. Will be my new ""go-to"" place for great comical t's."
Milk-SF,Harvey Milk and LGBTQIA icons are honored by artists in the walls of this excellent coffee shop.
Milk-SF,Fun coffee shop with good seating. But probably the worst latte I ever had in San Francisco. Avoid.
Milk-SF,"Hi Jack! Thank you for thinking were fun and have good seating. We’re very sorry you thought we had the worst latte in SF. Reviews like this really hurt small businesses like ours and we don’t take it lightly. Please let us know what you think would improve our latte, you can send your suggestions to admin@milk-sf.com Best, Scoots"
Milk-SF,"Milk is everything I want in a coffeehouse!  This vibrant, fairly recent addition to Valencia Street has good coffee, a varied and interesting menu of food choices, a comfortable and clean place to hang out for a bit, and very friendly people. Oh - and lots of fun art!  I may just have to become a regular."
Milk-SF,Please bring back the Ube products from the old distributor! The food was so unique and really set the cafe apart from others in food quality!
Milk-SF,"I love this truly San Francisco coffee/tea spot. Comfortable setting, friendly staff and tasty drinks.  Probably not for the more conservative minded, but a welcome bit of true color on Valencia."
Milk-SF,Possibly the best lox bagel I’ve ever had. And the dirty chai!!!
Milk-SF,"I live a couple blocks away, ride my bike past this place *all* the time and finally stopped into grab a Boichik bagel and check it out.  The staff was wonderful and the decor is so lovely and cozy. They sell a range of merch too, from clothing to thrown pottery to books. Definitely neighborhood cafe vibes, love that it's LGBTQ friendly and focused. I'll be back to try their coffee and relax with a book!"
Milk-SF,"Really great local coffee shop with plenty of space  and accepting of humans of all kinds. It’s nice, well-kept, and the coffee is great. I recommend the iced dirty chai tea latte with oat milk.  I’d recommend this place to anyone."
Milk-SF,"Yes, this is a cafe, and a wonderful one at that! A súper effing Awesome cafe! Boichik bagels, and cream cheese on point. (I’m a New York Jew so I have very high standards…the bagels are the best on the west coast). They always have really unique and interesting Italian sodas, and creative but delicious coffee drinks. They also cater heavily to vegan, and gluten-free needs. They are adding more and more food options which is great as this block has been in dire need of sandwich, salad, quick to grab lunch food options.  They have really great community events, cool items for sale, as well, that are already well documented in other reviews. Some of my neighbors didnt realize it’s a cafe, for some reason. But it is that! Come for the food, coffee (a damn, fine cup of coffee) and stay for the rest. The people who work here are friendly, kind and just wonderful to interact with it. Truly the best"
Milk-SF,The bagels were awesome! Also got the Nitro Cold Latte with Oat Milk and was BLOWN AWAY. It was perfectly sweet & creamy while still being dairy free. Will definitely be returning!
Milk-SF,"It's a new, accepting, and wonderful spot to grab a delicious latte and chat with your neighbors in line or sitting next to you.  I asked one of the baristas if they had any wifi and they said that they do not have wifi, because they want their coffee shop to be a social environment, not just another coffee shop pandering to the work from home crowd. (As a wfh person I was a little irked but there is literally another coffee shop down the street and I can just go and work from there lol). And honestly .. I love the atmosphere they're cultivating. It's extremely refreshing!  The business is new so they have some kinks to iron out ;), but aside from that I do believe they will be a great addition to the community."
Milk-SF,This place is buzzing and dog friendly too. Get a drink and a sandwich and revel in the community
Milk-SF,Such a fun place with tasty food and drinks options.
Milk-SF,"Cute spot with tasty food, cute art, friendly people and good vibes! Lots of vegan and dairy free options. Looking forward to visiting again soon!!"
Milk-SF,"The oat milk latte tastes like water-y milk, there’s barely any coffee. Not the friendliest service either."
Milk-SF,"Incredible vibes, super fast service."
Milk-SF,"This place is wonderful and just what the neighborhood needed. They’ve got it all; friendly staff, yummy beverages/snacks, and a welcoming space for people of all ages."
Milk-SF,this is probably my favorite space in SF; the food and drink were divine and the queerness was a breath of fresh air
Milk-SF,Love their sandwiches great flavorful taste n so fresh parking is a little tight but worth the wait.
Milk-SF,"Beautiful inside, with tons of GAY & QUEER ART😍 mmm coffee banana milkshake, thank you! ☕🍌🥤"
Milk-SF,Very cool cafe! Good bagels too. Lots of vegan options!
Milk-SF,"An amazing, cute little Queer spot with lots of menu options, friendly staff, great art and lots of small gifts."
Milk-SF,"Great decor, fantastic bagels ( love the pizza bagel!) and wonderful staff.  10/10"
Milk-SF,Very cool art-filled space.  Had the most *delicious* Marshmallow Latte.
