Mymy,"Great breakfast and lunch spot.  Indoor and outdoor seating.   So many good things on the menu, I tried 2 meals and took the leftovers home. - The Monte Cristo is delicious and properly fried. - I also tried the zucchini Parmesan pancake. This was amazing and I wish I had asked for extra butter."
Mymy,Hi Lyle. Thank you for joining us and for taking the time to write this very kind review! We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed  your Mymy Monte Cristo and Parmesan Crusted Zucchini Ricotta Pancake so much! We hope to have you back for another meal sometime very soon!
Mymy,"Food is always amazing. The crab cakes, ricotta pancakes, and burger was really good. Like is out the door starting at 10:30, so go early."
Mymy,"Thank you Robin. It's nice to see you enjoy our food and we greatly appreciate your wonderful review. Hopefully, you'll be back to see us sometime soon!"
Mymy,"First time here for breakfast and it was GREAT! Fast, prompt, and polite service! Good was great too! I ordered the Chile verde chilaquiles. Not spicy but very full of flavor. It came with cilantro and Mexican cheese mixed with diced onion.plate came with crispy potatoes and a side of meat in a small bowl.  We also ordered a “small” side of eggs with cheese for my son. 10/10 recommend!!"
Mymy,"Hi Yesenia, thank you for taking the time to provide us with such a kind review of your visit! We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your meal so much and would rate it a perfect 10! We look forward to the next opportunity to serve you, and hope that it's soon!"
Mymy,"Came in for breakfast. Short wait to get a table but we got there pretty early. Wife had the french toast and it was amazing. Fresh berries, marscapone cream. I had the bacon and eggs with crispy potatoes and zucchini ricotta pancakes. The bacon was thick and perfectly cooked. The potatoes were crispy. The pancakes were absolutely amazing. If/when im in the area again i will definitely be stopping in for breakfast!"
Mymy,"Hi Cory. We're happy you and your wife joined us for breakfast and enjoyed your meal so much, especially your french toast and pancakes! We're so glad to know you'll be returning when you're in the area again, and hope it´'s soon. Thank you!"
Mymy,"Quick to be seated even on for Saturday brunch service. Staff are all super friendly and the food comes pretty quickly! We had the challah french toast and 2 eggs with potatoes & toast, with a few sides. Very reasonable and good value portions. Bonus - bathroom is really clean."
Mymy,Hi Vivienne. We're happy you joined us and enjoyed your visit so much. We hope you'll be back again someday. Thank you!
Mymy,"Visited this place a couple weeks ago. There was a big line but moved quick.  Ordered the Crab cake Benedict and the Challah Bread French toast.  The Crab cake had a nice texture  and the lemon dill sauce gave it a nice zest. Really liked the  combination.  But the star of the show was the Challah Bread French Toast. Can't go wrong with the combo of macadamia and mascarpone and bacon. Just a exciting and fun combination of flavours and textures. I felt it was more desserty but definitely worth coming back for.  I probably feel the portions for both could be bigger, but in terms of flavour it was pretty good and something different from your regular breakfast."
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit and nice review, Fabio. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"The French toast with fried chicken was pretty good but would have been better with either powdered sugar or whipped cream on the side. Lemon pancakes were very good. We also enjoyed their mimosas. Overall, very pleased."
Mymy,Hi Ry. Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your brunch and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"Everything was exceptional! We got the Crab and Shrimp Cake Benedict, The Shrimp and Sausage Grits, the Crab Roll, the Banana Souffle Pancakes, and the Red Velvet Lattes with Oatmilk. It was delicious this is by far the best brunch place in sf! I love the amount of seafood options they have. I will be making my way back this week!"
Mymy,"Hi Mercedes. Thank you for your visit and wonderful review! We're happy to know you enjoyed your brunch, and we hope to see you back again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,"Great food. We asked to sit at a different table because it was in the sun and we were a little cold from waiting out side, they had no issue. Service was friendly and quick. Food was hot and fresh. Everything had a good flavor and presentation. I wish they had sourdough toast but no biggie."
Mymy,Hi Adam. We are happy to see you enjoy our food and service so much. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again in the near future. 
Mymy,Brought my 12yo daughter for breakfast on our spring break trip after reading great reviews and enjoyed the food. We got corned beef hash and eggs with potatoes. Paid $55 for 2 plus tip. Seemed pricey. But food was good. Would have loved fresh squeezed orange juice. Its a tiny little restaurant so youre sitting close to others which feela cramped or like you have to whisper. The waiters service when I told him I didnt like acacados that were saucy on top of my eggs was appreciated. He had manager come and replace my plate with a new one. Attentive service which I appreciated. I would work to keep prices lower however for what you get. The toasted multi-grain bread was soo good. No parking. Don't even try. Come in an UBER or walk to avoid frustration.
Mymy,"Ceci, thank you for bringing your daughter in for brunch. We are happy you got the service you needed on that dish and that you two had an enjoyable meal. We hope to see you back soon!"
Mymy,"The food is absolutely amazing, from the Chicken &French Toast to the banana pancakes, to the crab and shrimp Benedict. The service was great, and the atmosphere is fun. Must try place!!"
Mymy,"Hi Myron. Thank you for your visit and wonderful review! We're happy to know you enjoyed our food and service, and we hope to see you back again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,"1st time here. There was a line to come in, but it does move fast. The dining area is very small, and they have outdoor sitting. The food was good, portion sizes were of bigger portions. I'm not a fan of red velvet cake, but the red velvet latte here, WOW!! I say this is a must go to in SF. Plates average $22 each."
Mymy,Hi Claudia. We're happy you found us and enjoyed your food and red velvet latte so much. We hope you'll join us again someday. Thank you!
Mymy,Staff are super friendly and lines move very fast. We didn’t wait long before being seated. Food is above average but not good enough for me. There’s too much sweet sauce in waffle fried chicken dish and the crab cake Benedict is too salty. But I still want to come again to taste other dishes.
Mymy,"Hello. Thank you for your visit and generous comment regarding our service quality. We're glad you enjoyed your overall experience, and if ever there is anything we can do to ensure that you enjoy your food, please let us know. We look forward to serving you some delicious food, we're sure you will love soon!"
Mymy,"Great place for brunch. We got there within a half hour of opening and it was already packed, but they had outdoor sitting that was perfect and we got seated right away.  The lattes were great tasting and good quality, and not overly sweet.  Husband had the Classic Eggs Benedict and I had the Norwegian Benedict. Both were delicious!  We don’t go to San Francisco all that often, but if ever back in the area we would definitely come back here."
Mymy,"Hi Nicole, glad to learn your experience was a positive one. It is nice to know that you and your husband loved the taste and quality of our brunch menu items. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Had the best ever French toast with fresh berries and cream. I took a chance at ordering a pistachio latte and was not disappointed. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Since I was on vacation, I wanted splurge a little . I would definitely come back if and whenever I should return to SF."
Mymy,"Hi Francine. Thank you for your visit while you were in the city and for this very nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your French toast and pistachio latte so much, and also appreciated our service. Next time you in San Francisco we hope you come back to see us!"
Mymy,Fantastic brunch destination. Seats inside and outside (we sat inside) and super tempting menu. The coffee menu includes a range of interesting latte options. We loved the red velvet latte and lavender latte. For brunch we couldn't decide between the Eggs Benedict with lobster and Eggs Benedict with crab and shrimp - so had both and it was a great choice. The breakfast potatoes served on the were also a must have.  Highly recommended.
Mymy,"Hi Charlotte, thank you so much for the review. We're ecstatic to hear that you enjoyed our benedicts and lattes. Have a wonderful day!"
Mymy,"Had the vanilla curd banana pancakes. One of the best pancakes I have ever had, especially liked what they did with the banana. Only downside is that it’s a bit expensive"
Mymy,Hi Alper. Thank you so much for the kind rating. We hope you will visit us again some day!
Mymy,Nice place. Service was quick and our food tasted good. The portion size was big. We came on a Monday so it was not busy at all
Mymy,Hi LadyBug. Thank you for your visit and very nice comments! We're happy to know you enjoyed your Monday brunch and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"Great food, great customer service. They serve you plenty of food. Delicious delicious. Its a must to go spot! Get their early it gets busy. No reservations. Lobster Benedict and the crab cake Benedict are TOP favorite. Banana pancake 🥞so fluffy and delicious it melts in your mouth! PLEASE TRY IT"
Mymy,"José, we genuinely appreciate you letting us know that, and we will be sure to let the team hear they helped make your visit so enjoyable. Thank you for your very nice review, and we look forward to serving you again soon."
Mymy,"Where do I start! The food here is A+++! We went twice! We had the French toast with fried chicken, banana pancakes, corn beef with potatoes and the crab Benedict. MY OH MY everything was delicious no complaints!"
Mymy,"That's lovely to hear, Deandria. Thank you for your visit, it is great to know you loved your toast, chicken, and everything else. Hopefully, we'll serve you again soon!"
Mymy,The vibe is so calming. I’m picking this place we were really liked the presentation of the food. As a family of 4 there was a minimum wait time of about 10 minutes. Everything was absolutely delicious. We walked about 10 minutes here and the area wasn’t as pleasant. The iced coffee was a bit watered down and our table was not so clean.. But this was worth the walk! Bathroom was also very clean which is important. I’d come back !
Mymy,"Hi Samantha. We're thrilled you and your family enjoyed our clean and calming environment. We were happy to serve you and hopefully, we serve you again for a 5-star worthy experience!"
Mymy,"A nice small but highly popular eatery on Nob Hill right by a cable car stop. The food is very tasty and the service is fine. The place is quite dense inside, so you overhear all, sometimes noisy conversations. There are also at least 6 covered booths outside and a few tables alongside the restaurant windows."
Mymy,"Hi Michael, thank you for taking the time to provide us with a review of your visit. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your experience and we look forward to seeing you again soon!"
Mymy,"This spot serves more than just breakfast, but maaan! This was by far the best food I've had while visiting! I highly recommend"
Mymy,"Claire, thank you so much for your visit and for sharing your experience and pictures! We appreciate your review greatly and look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,This meal was so delicious with gravy and this turkey fried into a French toast coat with jelly and the potatoes were so crunchy
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit and nice review, Dominic. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your Monte Cristo so much, and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Delicious breakfast, worth every penny! I got MyMy breakfast with the lemon pancakes, bacon, potatoes, and over medium eggs, and it’s was so tasty! The crispness of the potatoes and bacon were perfect! Definitely would come here again and try other menu items too!"
Mymy,Hi Alicia. We're happy you joined us and enjoyed your breakfast so much! It's great to hear you found your meal so tasty and that your potatoes and bacon were perfect for you. We look forward to seeing you again someday very soon. Thank you!
Mymy,"A must for breakfast. Well worth the wait. Loved everything, the shrimp and grits, the classic eggs Benedict, banana pancakes & French toast with berries. Oh and their breakfast potatoes were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. So good!"
Mymy,"Renee, thank you for dining with us. We're glad you loved everything you ordered, especially how crispy and tender our potatoes were. Hopefully, we serve you again someday!"
Mymy,"I have been eyeing this cafe for a while now so was super excited to catch them this morning. The food and drinks were delicious! The service was attentive and efficient, we enjoyed ourselves. My wife and friend ordered the chicken and challah French toast and I ordered the tex mex scramble. It was an instagrammable worthy presentation and even better on the taste. Would definitely go back and recommend checking it out for yourself.  Pro tip: the lines may look long but they get through it really quick. Also, if you come before 9:30AM you don’t typically have to wait."
Mymy,Hi Marti. We're happy you and your wife joined us and enjoyed your visit so much. We hope you'll be back again someday. Thank you!
Mymy,Delicious western breakfast. But the space is very small and you might have to wait a bit in the queue. But all worth it.
Mymy,"Jim, thank you for your patience on any wait you had. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much and we appreciate your very kind words! Hopefully we'll see you back soon."
Mymy,"One of those it looks better than it tastes. It was ok. Wayy too heavy, soaking on butter and syrup. The strawberries were a bit mushy. Flavors are abit off, not delicate or satisfying, the aftertaste was weird.  There is cool booth seating outside.  Service is fast but we felt like they were trying to kick us out to serve the other people that were in the line.  Expects lines to eat here"
Mymy,"Hi Chantal, nice to know you appreciated our speed of service. We wish your experience could have been perfect but appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. It’s important for us to know how we can better serve our customers and your comments will be shared with the team."
Mymy,"My expectations were set high after seeing the reviews and pictures, this place absolutely met them. Delicious food."
Mymy,Hi M Allen. We're happy you joined us and enjoyed your visit so much. Thank you for the kind endorsement and rating. We hope you'll be back again someday soon!
Mymy,"Awesome spot to grab a last minute weekend brunch. Seating is first come first served. We arrived on a Saturday around 11am and were seated after about a 15 min wait.  We ordered the Miss Mymy which comes with eggs, choice of pancakes, potatoes, and choice of meat. The zucchini ricotta pancakes were delicious and potatoes were perfectly seasoned! The matcha and red velvet lattes were good though a little difficult to drink in the square mugs. Nice big portions. Will definitely be back!"
Mymy,"Hi Michelle, we’re thrilled to get this kind of feedback. We're happy to hear that you enjoyed both the taste of our food and portion sizes. We will share this with the team!"
Mymy,"Service is super friendly, the place is good. Plan to be on line for a while. Parking can be hard. My concern that all the glasses and carafes are from plastic and is not consistent with the concept. Another think is that the apple cider is not warm and is super expensive for the tiny bottle of martinellis apple cider. I think that they can improve the concept by trying to really do everything from scratch. Good decorations on the dishes on flavor was nah."
Mymy,"Judy, thank you for coming in and for the nice rating. We're glad you enjoyed our friendly service, but we're sorry to hear if you felt like your meal could've been better. We hope you communicated this to your server so that they could fix it on the spot and see to it that your meal is perfect in every way. Next time you're in please introduce yourself so that we can make sure you have a 5-star experience from start to finish."
Mymy,Pistachio latte is great. Mymy plate is pretty good! Montecristo is delicious!
Mymy,"Thank you E. It's nice to see you enjoyed your food and latte, and we greatly appreciate your wonderful review. Hopefully, you'll be back for another visit soon!"
Mymy,"Most amazing breakfast ever! Absolutely delicious, well prepared, well presented, good ingredients. Four of us ate, each having something different and every dish was fabulous.  One small negative. Call me old fashioned, but having to pay $120 for four of us to eat breakfast in a cafe smarted a bit."
Mymy,"Hi Alastair, that’s wonderful to hear. Thanks so much for leaving us a review. Glad you and your party enjoyed our delicious well-prepared menu items. See you next time!"
Mymy,"I showed up first thing in the morning at 9am on Sunday and the place was completely filled already. I had to wait a bit for a seat for just one! The cafe is rather small and feels cramped from my perspective. Atmosphere aside, the food was delicious and I liked their blend of traditional and trendy breakfast menu items. IF you enjoy small places and you get a seat you will almost certainly enjoy this Nob Hill cafe."
Mymy,"Josh, we're so glad you joined us, and thank you for your patience on any wait you had. It sounds like you had an excellent breakfast, and we hope you'll be back someday!"
Mymy,"Beautifully crafted breakfast/brunch dishes that exceeded my expectations. We tried the Challah French toast with fresh fruits and caramelized walnuts, corn beef hash with two eggs and a green hollidaise sauce, and the zucchini pancakes."
Mymy,"We appreciate your wonderful comment, Mack. It is great to hear how much you enjoyed our french toast, hash, pancakes, and eggs. We look forward to serving you more beautifully presented foods soon!"
Mymy,"Service was top notch, just like their food. If you are coming to San Francisco please stop here for breakfast.. I got the crabcake Benedict and it was amazing. The potatoes were nicely fried although they lacked seasoning. I also got an order of French toast which was amazing."
Mymy,Hi Justin. Thank you for your 5-star review. We're happy to learn how much you enjoyed our menu items and service. See you again soon!
Mymy,This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. They have excellent service and even better food.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone visiting San Francisco.  😃
Mymy,"Kareem, we’re so happy to hear you always have a good experience. Thank you for your generous comment on our food and service. Hope to see you again in the near future!"
Mymy,"Best breakfast!!  Right off the cable car line. I had the mymy with zucchini ricotta pancakes, my brother had the chilaquiles and french toast- everything was perfect, best breakfast we had during our trip. Service was outstanding and quick."
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit, Jessica! It's wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your breakfast experience so much and would consider it perfect! We appreciate your very kind review, and hope you join us the next time you're back in San Francisco! We look forward to serving you then."
Mymy,"Solid breakfast spot. I got the corned beef hash, the meat was well cooked, juicy and tender and went well with the peppers and onions of the hash."
Mymy,Hi Tyron. Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your breakfast and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,Great breakfast and brunch restaurant that opens until 2pm. Their egg Benedict’s are good. Highly recommended!
Mymy,"Thank you Chris. We greatly appreciate your wonderful review. Hopefully, you'll be back soon!"
Mymy,"Cute little breakfast spot, had a French toast and a pink and pistachio latte. Super delicious. Great service and a nice atmosphere ✨"
Mymy,"Hi Davina. We're grateful for your visit and are happy to see you enjoyed your French toast and latte so much, along with our atmosphere and service! Thank you! We look forward to serving you again very soon. "
Mymy,"Walking into the restaurant I wasn't expecting much, but the smells were magnificent. From the Bloody Mary to the Red Velvet Latte, the drinks were on point.  The food was the star of the show. Eggs were perfectly cooked, the pork sausage was obviously made in house and the potatoes, oh the potatoes, light and fluffy inside and crispy on the outside. Wish we lived here just so we could become regulars."
Mymy,"Tim, we wish you lived here too. Thank you for such a nice review! We're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much and we hope you make it back to San Francisco soon. "
Mymy,"First of all, stellar services. Very attentive and efficient. Secondly, the food is great. There's always a line but the establishment is quite spacious, so the line moves rather fast. There are also outdoor seatings. I got the smoked duck omelette and really like it!!! We also got the lemon souffle pancakes and they were good, huge portion and very fluffy."
Mymy,"As it was a lazy Sunday , my husband and myself decided to go on a breakfast adventure or should I say cafe hunting? And MyMy 😉 We are so pleased that we found this gold mine , we didn’t sit in ,we did a take out and we loved our breakfast choices , we ordered a crab 🦀 cake Benedict with lemon dill sauce and 2 eggs 🍳 🍳 any style . The pork patty is so fresh and so yummy and husband was bowled over the lemon dill sauce . We also took the cafe lattes which was really good as well . The pace has a indoor and a outdoor seating , plenty of tables to sit and a very friendly  staff ."
Mymy,Hi Jordana.Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"Mymy is a great place for brunch! Today I had the crab cake Benedict $20 with an IPA beer $5. With eggs Benedict, I like to pop the egg and let the yolk drip down all the way down to the bread. The crab cake had a pungent dill/lemon taste to it because of that green sauce on top. It is a distinct taste. The little crispy potatoes were OK. Not great. I would have preferred hashbrowns if it was available. Service was excellent and my food came out reasonably quick. I parked at a meter and it took exactly an hour from waiting on a table to finishing my food. Good job everyone at Mymy. I had a good brunch today."
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Jeffrey. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,My wife and I came here every weekend for years before we moved out of country. It’s so good that it’s the first place I go to whenever I’m back in town. Food is fantastic and the people are kind. Stopped in today after 3 years and they still remembered my order.  Menu recommendations: Everything. I have a particular affinity for the corned beef hash and the Tex Mex scramble.
Mymy,"Ace, we truly appreciate your years of patronage, and thank you for making us your first stop when you visit San Francisco. We loved having you back after the long break, and we hope to serve you often in the future!"
Mymy,"Monte Cristo was not a Monte Cristo. First, it was made on the grill (flatop) no mention of this on the menu: no breading encashing or just a grilled sandwich. Second, even though the traditional raspberry jam was listed on the menu, I was instead given cheap strawberry jam. When I requested the raspberry jam, the cooks just pulled out the strawberry chunks. Finally, I asked if they had a raspberry jam, and the manager said they no longer carried it and it was a typo. He was very friendly about it, but I still feel like at least a small discount would have been appropriate."
Mymy,"Ryan, thank you for coming in. Please accept our apologies if we didn't have the strawberry jam you were hoping for. We appreciate your feedback and will make sure our menu has the correct items listed. Next time you're in, please ask for a manager and we will make sure your meal is perfect in every way. Hopefully, we'll see you again soon."
Mymy,"Absolutely amazing. We showed up right as they opened and there was a short line. We were seated quickly, and our servers were very efficient. We tried a few of the dishes and all were delicious. I highly suggest the pistachio latte, crab cake Benedict, and the challah French toast. Totally worth the wait!"
Mymy,"Thank you for the lovely review, Gabrielle. We're happy your visit was perfect and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Great srvc Great menu & they have the best single breakfast dish w the dill crab cake Benedict. Maybe the quality of the crab cake itself can improve but still the best Benedict plate I seen in SF (imo)
Mymy,Hi Johney. Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you loved our menu items and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"Huckleberry's on Cleveland Ave is great.  We have been there twice and had the same server (waitress) who is awesome.  Don't know her name, but she has dark hair with a really skinny pony-tail.  Excellent food, excellent service!"
Mymy,"Got takeout here and it was the best brunch I’ve had in a while! Loved the pancakes, crispy potatoes and eggs!"
Mymy,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your takeout brunch meal so much, Sara, and we're grateful for your five-star review. Thank you! We hope you join us again soon for another meal, either at the restaurant or to take out!"
Mymy,"I've never eaten pancakes so fluffy and light. The location is quite small, so parties of 2 will need to share a table for 4 with another party of 2.  Round 2 nearly two years later: INCREDIBLE. I cannot believe how phenomenal this food is. Line was about 25 minutes for a 10:30 Sunday brunch, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. Food was pricey, but WELL worth the price tag of $18-30/entree. If I could give 6 stars, I would."
Mymy,"Hi Baelin! Thank you for your visit and very nice review. We are happy to see you enjoyed our food so much. Next time you come back, be sure you introduce yourself so we can thank you in person! We look forward to serving you again in the near future."
Mymy,The banana souffle pancakes are beyond excellent…. ample portions will satisfy the hungriest visitor. If it’s a chilly day sit away from the door in the left corner. Service is efficient.
Mymy,"Thank you very much for your kind comments! We're so glad to hear our Banana Souffle Pancakes were a hit, and we hope to serve you again sometime soon!"
Mymy,"First off, my favorite thing about this place is the variety of specialty Benedict’s on the menu, an eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast. Everything was wonderful here from my chai latte to the smoked salmon Benedict (I forgot the name on the menu but it will be the only Benedict with smoked salmon.) Seriously every bite was delicious from the poached egg, to the crispy potatoes to the salmon itself. Even the rye bread was really good. My friend enjoyed her crab cake Benedict and pistachio latte, she even ordered a second latte. The third plate was an almost savory French toast, super delish but not too smothered in sweet. I wish I could afford to have breakfast here every day, I will be back for sure!"
Mymy,"I had a good experience in MyMy for brunch. Very good food and selection. The home fries are some of the best I've ever had.  For the price, it's not one of the top brunch spots I've been in the bay, but very solid and worth a look if you're looking for a nice brunch time."
Mymy,"Hi Alex, we’re happy to know you enjoyed your brunch with us and that our home fries were some of the best you’ve had. We hope you will join us again someday. Thank you!"
Mymy,"An amazing breakfast! I had the banana souffle and it was really delicious. We were lucky that there wasn't a line, so we could sit immediately. There is outside seating, but might be a bit noisy with all the traffic. Prices are very reasonable"
Mymy,"Local place with great food! Always fresh and tasty fruit. Experimental brunch menu that’s worth exploring the unknown. There is outdoor seating and it’s cozy inside. Food comes out quickly too, very correct and efficient with orders. These have been some of the best home potatoes I’ve ever had, sometimes. The prices have gone up recently, but they give considerable portions. The seasonal fruit with pancakes is just 1 kind of fruit, not a mix as one might expect."
Mymy,So much dill.  They love their dill sauce which is fine and good but it's too much.  Salmon tartine was rich and luxurious.  Crab cakes weren't amazing and doused in too much dill sauce.  Coffee wasn't very good but orange juice is as delicious as reviews have said.  But what bothered me the most was that the volume of the wait staff talking and joking amongst themselves was louder than the kitchen and customers put together that made the atmosphere awkward.
Mymy,Amazing pancakes! Worth every calorie of it. It’s very busy so get there earlier. You do sit very closely to everyone so we were not lucky with our loud neighbors but there is nothing anyone could do about it..
Mymy,"(Visit 8/5/17) Got the french toast, crab cake as a side and a latte. The Challah bread was soft and very flavorful. It was topped with strawberries, and a cream sauce. It definitely complemented the french toast well. The crab cakes were amazing. They were topped with some sort of pesto mayo based sauce. Couldn't get enough of the crab cakes. Lastly,  the latte was sweet yet strong. Which is how I like it. The place is small, but clean. The staff was very friendly and service was fast."
Mymy,"line was justifiedly long but we were seated fairly shortly upon arriving. great presentation and even better flavour, french toast was one of the best i’ve had. mimosa wasn’t bad but a little overpriced. bf enjoyed his omelette though and overall food was great"
Mymy,"Mai, thank you for your patience on any wait you had in line, although it normally moves fairly quickly. We're happy to hear you and your bf enjoyed your meals so much and we appreciate your very kind words! Hopefully we'll see you back soon."
Mymy,"Food overall was pretty good, but the banana soufflé pancakes were not soufflé - just regular pancakes. This was especially disappointing because we had ordered them precisely because they were soufflé.  Salmon tartine was good, though very creamy/saucy. There is cream cheese AND a thick cream dill sauce on top so this masked the flavorful- ness of the dish a bit. Would recommend getting the cream cheese or dill sauce on the side.  Service was efficient, but not very friendly. I think our server was in a bad mood that day, which I understand happens from time to time."
Mymy,"Hi Emily, thank you for your visit! We're glad to hear you found our food tasty but are sorry if some items didn't meet your expectations. We appreciate the feedback and will do everything we can to make sure that your next visit will be a 5-star experience! Hopefully we get a chance to serve you again sometime soon!"
Mymy,"Delicious anniversary breakfast.  Very accommodating.  Had a brief wait for this cozy little restaurant, but service was fast.  Asked if I could get a side of fried chicken with my French toast (which was delicious) and lots of fresh fruit, also asked if they could make us a velvet latte w/out coffee.  They happily accommodated every request and service with a smile!"
Mymy,"Hi C. We are happy to see you enjoyed your special anniversary visit and liked our food, atmosphere, and service so much. Thank you for the kind review and rating! We look forward to serving you again sometime very soon. "
Mymy,Delicious breakfast location with great atmosphere and respectable prices. Will definitely go back!
Mymy,"Hi G. Thank you for your visit and nice comments on our food, atmosphere and prices! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,"Had an omelette, had three pieces of sausage all the rest was onions, not good my wife and daughter got their food and I waited 10 minutes to get mine.  Don’t go off of other star ratings, that is what we did and very disappointed"
Mymy,"steven, we sincerely apologize if you had what sounds like a less-than-ideal visit with us. That certainly is not the type of comments we normally hear, nor the experience we aim to deliver. If possible, please message us at mymyreopen@gmail.com with details of when you were in, so we can look into what may have happened and make sure next time we have the chance to serve you, it will be an outstanding meal. Thank you."
Mymy,Rude staff. We waited online for more than 10 min outside where she rudely told to go and it was dusty outside because there was construction going in front of the restaurant. We asked one of the staff when we will be seated but she yelled at us saying she had not time for that. We asked why she was yelling she said she was not and she didn’t have time to seat us. Her attitude towards customers was not at all pleasant and we left because we didn’t want to deal with such person. I hope you can train her on how to deal with customers.
Mymy,"Yasmiin, thank you for your visit and this feedback. We will look into what happened and make sure it is not an issue again. Please accept our apologies. We hope you can join us again soon for what we're certain will be the excellent experience most guests have. "
Mymy,"Pancakes and bacon were good, but $20 good? Not really. Service was spotty. Little too pricey for breakfast food. You will get good food, just be prepared to pay a premium. Moderate recommendation"
Mymy,"Brunch food was good along with their hot lattes, however I don’t really see the hype and would not wait longer then maybe 15 mins. Guess it was good to come once and try it out."
Mymy,"Anony, thank you for your patience on any wait you had. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal and hopefully we'll see you back again sometime in the future."
Mymy,I will definitely be back. I got the Miss Mymy that included ricotta zucchini pancakes (yum!). Eggs were perfectly poached. Mango mimosas were great. I'm looking forward to trying more things on the menu.
Mymy,"Glad to learn your experience was a positive one, Elsie. We were happy to serve you every one of your dishes. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Best breakfast in the Nob Hill neighbourhood!!! Don't go if you're on a diet. But if you like your bread, your eggs, your avocado, your tomatoes and a proper fry-up, this is the spot. Sit outdoors and watch people negotiate San Fran hill-parking!"
Mymy,"We were told to go here by a local to SF….. I’m glad that we endured the 15 minute walk with hangry kids!  The food was great, and the portions were enormous!  It’s well worth the wait if you have one when you get there."
Mymy,Hi BVK. We're happy you and the kids joined us and enjoyed your visit so much. We hope you'll be back again someday. Thank you!
Mymy,"The food here is delicious! Large serving, so much we couldn’t finish our meals. Food was fresh, warm, & tasteful. Serve was friendly and timely. I would recommend Mymy ."
Mymy,"Jody, we’re so happy to hear you enjoyed the freshness of our food and portion sizes. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Mymy coffee shop is our favorite brunch place , today we had chilaquiles verdes, challah bread French toast and dirty chai. Everything was perfect food, service and ambiance. French toast very savory and verdes have real Mexican taste. Also home fries is super crispy and perfectly seasoning. Will come back and try something more."
Mymy,"Long wait on a Saturday around 11, but worthwhile. Very good food, kind and attentive staff."
Mymy,Hi Dante. Thank you for your visit. That is our busiest time of the week and we appreciate your patience with any wait you had. We’re happy you enjoyed your food and our staff. Hopefully you will join us agin soon!
Mymy,"I'm a huge potato fan, and the home fries here are right on target. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The crab and shrimp eggs benedict were beautifully executed. My waitress was also very friendly."
Mymy,This place is absolutely delicious. Great feeling outdoor tables and excellent customer service. Best brunch dishes specially French toasts
Mymy,"Violeta, we’re so happy to hear you had a good experience. It is great that you enjoyed our food, service, and environment. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
Mymy,Outdoor ambience was great. Food is not too bad. Tex Mex Scramble is good and worth the price.
Mymy,"Thank you for coming in, Kat. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your visit and we hope to serve you again soon!"
Mymy,"Came here for breakfast and was pleasantly greeted by a long, but fast line. It was def worth the wait as my Chilaquiles and my latté were delicious. The potatoes were well seasoned and crisped to perfection. The pulled pork was amazing. As someone who usually avoids pork, this was worth the 5 mile walk later. The verde guacamole salsa that the chilaquiles is generously topped with had a good spice level, enough onions and it complimented the rest of the dish well. My friends got the pancakes and and an omelette both of which were very good. Be aware they do not do substitutions here, what’s on the menu is what you get. But you will not be disappointed."
Mymy,"That's great to hear, George. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know that everything was tasty and seasoned to perfection. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Pretty good but not in a rush to come back, seems overpriced. I liked the zucchini pancakes, they’re an unusual menu item. Orange juice was terrible, service felt rushed."
Mymy,"Hello Sarah. We appreciate your visit and review. We're happy to hear that you enjoyed your pancakes. Know that we make all our food to order, with the freshest, best quality ingredients. The price reflects the quality and the handcrafted nature of our menu items. We hope to see you again sometime soon for a 5-star dining experience."
Mymy,"The servers were amazingly attentive and had great suggestions for the food - which was also stunningly good. We had the lobster roll and fried chicken challah french toast with red velvet and ube lattes and mango mimosa. For a last minute pick, this ended up being a gem that I would not hesitate to go back to"
Mymy,"We're glad you made your way to our restaurant, Evan. It is amazing to hear that you enjoyed our french toast, Ube latte, Lobster Roll, and more. Hopefully we serve you again someday soon!"
Mymy,"We visited San Francisco over the Memorial Day weekend and decided to check this place out after the numerous reviews I read online. I’ll have to admit-I am so glad we tried this place! I took my parents and they absolutely loved it. We still talk about our meal till today (mainly because the total on our bill took us to surprise lol) but this place still deserves a 5 star rating. We ordered the Norwegian eggs Benedict, the Baja California eggs Benedict and the Banana soufflé pancakes. We were 3 people and the meal was perfect. Make sure to get potatoes with your eggs Benedict as they are literally to die for. I have no idea how they make them but you just can’t stop eating those potatoes. If I visit San Francisco again I’ll definitely come eat here again! Be ready to wait in a line though!"
Mymy,"Aliya, we are so happy to hear that you and your parents enjoyed your meals with us! Thank you so much for sharing your positive experience and nice pictures. We hope to see you back sometime soon again!"
Mymy,"Delicious eggs benedict! Both the BLT and the dungeness crab are super tasty and quite big (two plates can probably feed 3 people).  There's usually a line outside, but goes quite fast. The service could be a bit faster too. Coffee is the usual American weak-ish dinner coffee."
Mymy,Amazing breakfast! We read a review about the lemon cottage cheese pancakes so had to check it out. Definitely a win! The other was challah french toast. Both were delicious and our server was so friendly and inviting. Visit if you love breakfast!
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Georgia. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal and service. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
Mymy,"Absolutely delicious food with large portions! Their crew hustles, but still expect a line with somewhere this good."
Mymy,"Thanks for taking time out of your day to review us, Steven. So happy to hear you loved the taste and portion sizes of our meals. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Great, filling and affordable breakfast. There’s usually a wait but we got seated for a table of 2 in about 5-10 mins. The Norwegian Benedict was amazing. The OG is freshly squeezed and is a must!! Country potatoes too!"
Mymy,"Very great place to start your day, whether you're visiting or a local. The food is wonderful, service friendly, and portions very generous. Pricing is moderate but it's excellent quality food. Juices are all hand squeezed and fresh. It's a very small place. Very small, like 15 tables. So there can be a small weight. But it is worth it. The fresh lemonade is really really really good."
Mymy,"We had souffle  pancakes which was good but not the traditional fluffy souffle pancakes that I know. Also had the Frisco omelet which was just alright. Our server  was trying to be a hostess and wait on tables at the same time but struggling to do both. So expect to wait.  They need to hire more servers.  Still, I give her an A for effort."
Mymy,"Jamie, we're happy to hear your enjoyed our pancakes, thank you for coming by and we hope to serve you again soon."
Mymy,"Pros: wide variety of breakfast-y foods. Everything is tasty, and portion sizes are decent.  Cons: it’s another overpriced brunch spot (to be expected in sf), it’s crowded, hard to get good seating, hard to park."
Mymy,"Thank you Niel for your visit and review. We are thrilled to hear how much you loved our meals and portion sizes! We are sorry to hear if you feel like the menu items were not the price you were hoping for. We make all our food to order, with the freshest, best quality ingredients. The price reflects the quality and the handcrafted nature of our food. We hope to see you again sometime soon."
Mymy,"Generous portions of delicious American brunch. Coffee/espresso products are a bit bland.  Shrimp w grits: grilled shrimp, red sausage, two poached eggs, brussel sprouts and salsa fresca over cheese grits. Served with toast. Solid dish. $17.5  Banana pancakes: chestnuts, bananas, egg white merengue. The merengue was a bit excessive, but it's filling. $13  Coffee: free refills but it's watery and bland  Latte: again, they seem to serve bland caffeine products"
Mymy,Absolutely perfect food. We had the banana soufflé pancakes and an omelette. The crispy potatoes were also great. Highly recommend.
Mymy,"Thanks for taking time out of your day to review us, M. We're happy to hear that you enjoyed your overall experience. Hopefully, we serve you again soon for another excellent visit."
Mymy,Really jummy but it was a bit cold where we were sitting
Mymy,Hi Evelyne. Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your food and we hope to serve you again soon!
Mymy,"Nice breakfast place. You'll have to wait in line for a while. I liked the benediction, we tried two of them and both were good. Pancakes are good as well. Service is a bit slow."
Mymy,Food was okay. A 20% gratuity was auto added to our bill without notifying us. We ended up paying $40+ for gratuity and tips for a $100 meal
Mymy,"Hi Gugugu. We greatly appreciate your visit but are sorry to hear you didn't feel your experience was ideal. If ever something isn't exactly as you had hoped, please let us know right away so we can offer immediate assistance. Thank you, and we look forward to serving you again for what we're sure will be an outstanding dining experience."
Mymy,"The food was great. We had to wait a bit to be seated (20 min) but we came on a Saturday morning, so probably during the week people don’t have to wait that long."
Mymy,"Hello Janna. Thank you for dining with us, we're glad you enjoyed your food. We're sorry you felt you had to wait longer to be seated on a busy Saturday morning. Hopefully your next visit is even better than your last."
Mymy,"One of the best eggs benedict that I’ve had in SF. We tried the salmon benedict and the dungeoness crab benedict- both were delicious. There is usually a line out front during the weekends, but the wait is definitely worth it."
Mymy,"My experience at the restaurant was horrible. Waited in the line for 10 minutes without anybody acknowledging us. When we asked when we’re gonna be seated we were rude reply that she doesn’t have time for us. When we asked why, she was yelling at us yelling she said she was not when clearly she was. I would not recommend going here."
Mymy,"Hello Fadumo,  We sincerely apologize for the experience you had at our restaurant. We understand your frustration and disappointment, and we genuinely apologize for the way our staff member handled the situation. Please know that we take your feedback seriously, and we will use it as an opportunity to improve our services and communication. Hopefully you will consider visiting us in the future so that we can provide you with the exceptional dining experience that we strive for and you deserve. Thank you. "
Mymy,Ate here for the first time and the food is amazing. I recommend trying them out whenever you're in the area. Their menu selection is amazing and the prices are affordable.
Mymy,"Aminu, we truly appreciate your wonderful comments and look forward to serving you again. Thank you!"
Mymy,"The service was great. I went for brunch and it was busy, so we did a line for 40 minutes. I was happy they had Almond milk hot chocolate. I also order the crab cakes Benedict, it was ok. I could barely taste the crab but the presentation was good."
Mymy,"This place is amaizing!! I love their food , especially their place Tex-Mex it's the best for me their  food is delicious!!!  Everything is fast  , You have to make line but not for long time ."
Mymy,Hi Viviana. Thank you for your visit and lovely review. It's wonderful to know you enjoyed your meal so much. We hope you'll be back again soon!
Mymy,Delicious breakfast spot with patio tables available. I recommend ordering the Tex-Mex Scramble and the Lemon Dill Crab Cakes Benedict. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also pretty tasty! Beware there can be a long line on the weekends!
Mymy,"Great location, nice sunny terrace. Friendly and helpful staff. The food is very tasty, the plates are huge. Various eggs Benedict, all delicious!"
Mymy,"I was there for breakfast, order benedict lime dill and Pancakes, the pancake was great, the benedict was average"
Mymy,"Firas, thank you for your visit. We're happy you enjoyed our pancakes so much, and hopefully we'll have the chance to serve you again soon for what we are certain you will consider a 5-star meal. Please let us know!"
Mymy,The staff waa very friendly. Food was gorgeous AND delicious! Almost too pretty eat! It was very clean and Covid restriction compliant. The entire atmosphere was warm and welcoming!
Mymy,Mannnnn this place was GREAT. Everything fresh and good. 6 of us ate here on Vacation. Was definitely impressed.
Mymy,"Kyucca, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much. Thank you for your very kind review and compliments and we look forward to serving you the next time you're in the area!"
Mymy,"I came here for brunch with a friend on a Sunday morning. The service was great. As soon as we walked in we were asked if we wanted to dine inside or outside. We both figured we dine inside since it was pretty cold outside. We were seated next to the window and given menus. My friend already knew what she wanted since she's pretty much a regular here. It was my first time, so I had to look over the menu. I contemplated on the Tex-Mex Scramble but ended up getting the Challah Bread French Toast. This menu item comes with Mascarpone sweet cream, roasted macadamia, seasonal fruits, bacon (but you can ask them to not include the bacon), and maple. I also got a mimosa with orange juice.  The Challah Bread French Toast was amazing! It wasn't even sweet which I'm so thankful for. Too many restaurants had tons of sugar in their food items, I'm so glad this place doesn't. My food was very mildly sweet and the mixture of the French toast with the sweet cream, macadamia, and maple was just simply delicious! My friend and I really enjoyed our mimosas as well."
Mymy,"Dawn, we are so glad you came in! Thank you for you kind compliments on our food, we're happy to hear that you loved the Challah Bread French Toast.  Hopefully you'll get a chance to come visit us again soon!"
Mymy,The staff is rude!! We came and there were three other people who came the same time and one of the staff rudely said don’t  stand here line up behind the robe. The sign that says to line up was not visible but we stood behind it after she yelled. Staff moved in and out serving other customers after 10 min standing in line I asked if someone can seat us to one of the staff. She yelled at me saying she does have time and can’t seat us I asked her why she was yelling I asked because we were standing for a while and we could see tables open. She kept yelling she has no time!. We wasted time and while we were standing outside there was construction work going on and we got dusts all over us. I think her attitude and the way she talked to us was not appropriate and we got offended and left.
Mymy,"Hello Amina, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our restaurant. We sincerely apologize for any negative encounter you had with our staff. We strive to provide exceptional service to all our guests, and it is disheartening to hear that we fell short of your expectations on this occasion. We deeply regret any miscommunication that may have occurred during your visit and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the confusion regarding the line and the lack of visibility of the sign. We will address this issue promptly to ensure it doesn't happen again. We'd love to have a second chance to serve you again someday, and please introduce yourself so we can apologize directly. "
Mymy,"Very Small Coffee House down the corner between Larkin Street & California Street.  Came around 10am in the morning and there was already short queue. We waited for approximately 20mins before getting our table.  The menu selection was quite alot to choose from.  The portion was generous, so if you dont eat alot of breakfast, I recommend you to share.  The staff was very friendly and proactive."
Mymy,I'm sorry but this was not that good. Very average and not worth the hype or even stay in line. Also don't eat in those boxes outside because it smells like pee. Overall overpriced and not satisfied.
Mymy,"Hello, thank you for your visit but we apologize if it was not ideal. Please know we clean our outdoor seating area many times daily and have not had similar comments, but we will keep a sharp eye on them.  Also, if ever you receive any item that is not what you expected, communicate that to us immediately so we can either make you a new version, or recommend something else you will better enjoy. We hope to serve you again for a meal we're sure you will enjoy in every way."
Mymy,"Tasty fresh-squeezed juice, and my langoustine omelet had plenty of meat in it. Cheese was generic and thick, though. Very crisp potatoes but soft on the inside. Annoying system where you have to wait in a line outside to get a seat, but it moved very quickly."
Mymy,Chose this place by recommendations and tried their mex scramble and lemon ricotta pancake. I have to say they they really did live up to the hype. The scrambled eggs were flavourful and the hash was the bomb!! The ricotta pancake was soft and fluffy. Almost soufflé like. Overall a lovely place. Be sure to get there early as the queue builds up especially on weekends!
Mymy,"3.5 stars  We tried to choose a place for brunch which didn’t have an insane wait on a Sunday morning. We yelped this place, called in and found that the wait was only about 30 minutes. When we arrived, we found out that you have to stand in line and that there is no wait list. Since the line wasn’t super long, we decided to wait.  We got the lemon dill shrimp cake which was pretty good. The crab/shrimp cake was surprisingly good and the lemon dill hollandaise was not bad. I wish it was a little more lemon-y or dill-y though. There was just a hint. They didn't give us a giant sheet of hash browns which is what we were expecting (from yelp pics), but we got house potatoes instead. They were actually pretty good, but we had our hearts set on a giant hash brown. We also go the lemon ricotta soufflé pancake which I was really excited about, but was kind of disappointed with. It just tasted more like eggs, less like pancakes and barely any lemon flavor. Maybe I’m confused on what a soufflé pancake is, but it was just okay.  Overall, this place as okay food and the place is more homey and not as up to date as some other brunch places."
Mymy,"Great food. Service is fast, fun and easy. Very small place, but tables turn pretty quickly.  Portions are huge, and the food is absolutely delicious."
Mymy,"Delicious! A wide variety of food choices and very satisfying meal. I had the crab cake Benedict with skillet potatoes and a lateé and it lasted me all day. Flavorful, large portion, affordable, great staff, clean, organized. It's a small space but the food packs a punch."
Mymy,One of my favourite restaurants in SF! The hot chocolate is a must try!
Mymy,"Hi Shane. Thank you for your stellar review! We're thrilled to hear we're among your favorite restaurants in San Francisco, and that you enjoy our hot chocolate so much. We look forward to having you with us again sometime very soon."
Mymy,We travel a lot and eat out a lot and are sort of proudly snobby foodies. This was fabulous.  Simply that.   Had shrimp and Dungeness crab Benedict With avacado. Perfectly cooked. Hollandaise was sublime.   Potatoes were amazing.  Friend had egges with cheese onion etc. also great.  Worth the wait. Service was great.   Highly highly recommend.  Go
Mymy,"Scott, thank you for your visit and very nice review. We are happy to see you enjoyed our food and service so much. Next time you come back, be sure you introduce yourself so we can thank you in person! We look forward to serving you again in the near future."
Mymy,"Busy brunch place offering all the usual brunch dishes and some rarities. In particular, the lobster roll is to die for. Large portions and really fast service. Be warned that they don't have a waiting list, so get ready to stand in line to get in!"
Mymy,"The potatoes are so good you won't believe your taste buds, perfectly made egg Benedict's, and the fluffiest souffle pancakes!! good service but always a little crowded, worth the wait though"
Mymy,One of my all-time favorite breakfast places in San Francisco! Amazing food and a great wait staff! Don't forget to try the home fries!
Mymy,Hi Daniel. That's great to know. We are happy to see you enjoy our breakfast and staff so much. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again in the near future. 
Mymy,Only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I want to keep it a secret. The service was excellent. The food was amazing! The prices weren't outrageous for the quality. This is now my favorite place in San Fransisco!!
Mymy,Great breakfast! Lovely staff and really great selection of food. The pancakes are awesome.
Mymy,Wow these eggs were fantastic. Fav brunch I ate while visiting San Fran.
Mymy,"Stephanie, that's so kind of you to say. We're thrilled to know you enjoyed your brunch so much and hope to serve you again soon. Thank you!"
Mymy,Absolutely delicious food.  Wonderful friendly service.
Mymy,"We appreciate the review, Joanne. Thanks for taking the time. Happy to hear you liked our food and service. Have a wonderful day!"
Mymy,"My reason for this 2 star rating is legitimate and I believe the employees need to get it right and pay attention to the customer and own up to what they messed up. My wife and I were visiting San Francisco and we were looking for very good breakfast spots. Found this one as the reviews seemed pretty decent. Well, of course it is a bit chilly so it’s not their fault. However, I believe they should make sure there are heaters outside even on one side. Ok,I was on. Next thing, if you take a look at my photo, I have two areas marked in red. My reason for doing this was because our waitress gave us a problem. My wife specifically asked and even read the menu item, CHICKEN N CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST. The waitress heard and marked it. Once my wife got her order, it was only the challah French toast and no chicken. My wife asked where the chicken was and the waitress insisted that my wife didn’t say that. Ok, instead of apologizing, she basically said we can fix this by giving you a piece of chicken which sounded like an extra cost when it shouldn’t have been in the first place. I could be wrong but again, it’s what it sound like. Not only that, if you look at the photo again, the waitress said it doesn’t come with the salad or potatoes. If it doesn’t, why is that in the same section with either meal (with and without chicken)? I ordered the Florentine Breakfast Sando and mine came with the potatoes. So once again, I’m not understanding why it doesn’t fall under the same category. Please fix this on the menu if it’s incorrect and teach the employees to apologize for their mistake when delivering customer service!"
Mymy,"Hi Christopher, thank you for coming in. Please accept our apologies for the misunderstanding about the menu. We will use your review as a training opportunity for our team to make sure nothing like this happens going forward. We would like another chance to impress you, next time you visit us please ask for the manager and we will see to it that everything is perfect from start to finish. Hopefully, we'll see you and your wife again sometime in the near future."
Mymy,Fantastic food but long wait and outdoor seating left much to be desired. Tables were small and the booths gave no privacy to the table next to us.
Mymy,"Hi Nicole, thank you so much for the review. We're glad you enjoyed your food, and in the future if you are not completely comfortable with where you're seated, let us know so we can do our best to accommodate you. Have a great day!"
Mymy,Holy smokes. EAT HERE! Awesome breakfast spot. The presentation of the food is awesome right down to the white fiestaware. I bet the wait can be long but I got right in. Ordered the tex Mex scramble and it's incredible. Good flavor. Also food was at the table in like 5 minutes. Staff is also very friendly. Stop in. Eat here. Haven't even finished my food before I started this review.
Mymy,Great service and great food.  Wait was only a few minutes.  Inside was a bit cramped
Mymy,"Thank you for the 5-stars, David! We're glad that you enjoyed our food and service, and we hope you'll come visit us again sometime soon!"
Mymy,Great breakfast spot with some really great options. The food is delicious and very nice to look at!
Mymy,"Thanks so much for the kind words, Connor. It is great to hear that you enjoyed the presentation of our food and our menu options. Hope you have an amazing day!"
Mymy,"Wonderful find. During our month-long stay in the City, we had occasion to grab breakfast at many places and enjoyed most of our meals. Out of all the breakfast places, we found Mymy to serve the most scrumptious breakfast. My son had the Flatiron Steak and Benedict with Chimichurri sauce. The steak was a perfect medium rare ... nice reddish pink without bleeding and well seasoned. The eggs were poached to perfection with a nice run of the yolk after the cut. The sauce was a savory compliment to the dish. Surprisingly, the equal star to the steak and eggs were the potatoes, which were crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. Swirl the potatoes in the runny yolk with a bite of the steak makes for a very yummy bite. I had the Challah Bread French Toast that was battered in mascarpone cream sauce. My goodness, it was heavenly. You could enjoy it without the syrup, but at that point might as well dunk each bite into the syrup and get a proper sugar rush. The dish was topped with a generous portion of fresh berries and almond slivers to balance each bite with freshness and texture. Thoroughly enjoyed this place. Get there early .... there is always a line and the place is rather cozy in size."
Mymy,"Love coming here for breakfast, the (mostly) Vietnamese staff is always friendly and ready to help.  Also the portions are very sufficient so you won’t need to eat until later that afternoon, so also great for brunch."
Mymy,"Great but not amazing. Definitely a good place to eat, can get packed but I’ve been to other places where the line was well worth it. My favorite here is there matcha green tea latte."
Mymy,"Worth the wait, near perfect breakie. The eggs are to kills for while the potatoes are to die for! My friend dragged me across the town for this, forever grateful! Oh by the way, next door coffee is very good too."
Mymy,"Incredible food, super quick service, and lovely people!"
Mymy,"Thank you for joining us, Elizabeth, and for this very kind review! It's great to know you enjoy our food and service and hope we see you again sometime very soon!"
Mymy,I highly recommend this restaurant 👍🏻Delicious and beautiful breakfasts are guaranteed. The staff is polite.
Mymy,Overall service could be a lil better. Ordered shrimp and grits. Sausage and shrimps were cooked very well. Shrimp had good seasoning. Grits could have had a thicker consistency and did not like the sour cream combination. Would definitely go again to get a different experience
Mymy,"Hi Reef. We greatly appreciate your visit, but are sorry to hear you didn't feel your meal was ideal. If ever something isn't exactly as you had hoped please let us know immediately so we can make you a new item or help you choose something else you will love. Thank you and we look forward to serving you again for what we're sure will be an outstanding dining experience."
Mymy,"My breakfast was not hot & fresh I’d hate to complain & have them remake it but I believe they had it sitting for a min, ordered a latte at least 15mins before I got the food & 20 mins later it was still warmer then food"
Mymy,"Wint, that's very unusual to hear. We hope you did ask us to make you a new breakfast if yours was not perfect. If not, next time you visit please ask for a manager so we can see that you enjoy your meal. Thank you. "
Mymy,Nice breakfast location with great food and decent portions.  Tables quite close together when seated outside. Worth a visit if your staying close by.
Mymy,Amazing food. Best breakfast in SF
Mymy,"Thank you for the compliments, Stefanie. It's wonderful to see you enjoy our food and we greatly appreciate your kind review. Hopefully, you'll be back to join us again very soon!"
Mymy,What a joke.  Talk about getting over on me for my hard earned $30.  Yup.  Costed me $30 for these burnt pancakes and potato's and bacon. What a big disappointment and a waste of money😞 …
Mymy,"Skirt, thank you for your order. Please accept our apologies if your pancakes were not as you were hoping for. If you could, please contact us directly and we will make sure your next meal is perfect in every way. Hopefully, we'll get another chance to impress you soon."
Mymy,"Very kind wait staff. They were so patient with us as we took way too long to get our people together. Excellent food, I wish I could go back and try everything on the menu."
Mymy,"Hi Haley, thank you so much for your kind words. We're so happy you had such a nice experience with us and we hope too that you could visit us again soon for some more tasty discoveries! Hopefully we'll get to serve you again sometime in the near future!"
Mymy,"Great brunch spot! Arguably has the best brealfast potatoes in the city, great to accompany the delicious benedicts. We always split a pancake for the table in addition - both the banana souffle and the zucchini ricotta pancakes are amazing. They do not take reservations so you line up outside. There are some nice outdoor tables. the inside is no frills but the food is so worth it!"
Mymy,"The food we ordered were not great. The espresso drink was okay, the red velvet latte was fantastic though."
Mymy,"Karthik, it sounds like you enjoyed our Red Velvet Latte, and we appreciate the compliment. However, we are sorry to hear you didn't feel everything was perfect. Please know if ever something you order isn't exactly as you had hoped, we want to hear about it on the spot so we can make you a new version or help you choose something else you will love. Thank you and hopefully you will be back soon for what we are certain will be an excellent meal. "
Mymy,"Really nice! Staff are super friendly, and the food is great! Banana pancakes are incredible!!"
Mymy,Awesome food!  We enjoyed the potatoes and souffle pancakes!  Both portioned over well enough for two people!
Mymy,"Delicious!!! Best corned beef hash I've had! We went back the next day it was so good. Tried the BBQ burger,  and it was decadent!"
Mymy,Great little breakfast/brunch spot. Small and busy with a bit of a wait (usually a good sign) but quick to get seated and good service. Nice menu with some interesting takes on benedicts.
Mymy,If you are visiting San Francisco this is a great place for a full breakfast. Vegeterian dishes available. The pancakes were amazing.
Mymy,"I'm mexican, and believe me, i know about chilaquiles, and i can tell you now, the chilaquiles over there are the best!! Awesome mimosas too"
Mymy,"That's means a lot to us, Jose! Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Great tasting food. The corned beef hash isn’t hash but it’s tasty, get a salad with it. The home fries are delicious and the crab cake Benedict is also amazing"
Mymy,We stopped on a whim and it was beyond delicious. The pistachio latte was particularly excellent
Mymy,"Hi Molly. Thank you for your visit and review. We're happy to hear you enjoyed the latte. Hopefully, we serve you again someday for another 5-star worthy visit!"
Mymy,The 4 of us loved it. The food was excellent and their presentation was great.  Also flavoured mimosas.  Yum.
Mymy,"I took a girl for a second date here.  Food was great and she liked it too.  The Pancakes were so light a fluffy.  Food have us enough energy to walk around SF and get to know each other better, third date secured!  This place made me look like I knew what places are good or not.  Thanks for being part of securing the third date and many more."
Mymy,Hi Tres. Thank you for taking the time to review us. Nice to know we helped make your second date a success. Hope you have an amazing day!
Mymy,Food is just great ! Drinks too. I loved it !
Mymy,"Lauby, we’re so happy to hear you had a good experience. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Amazing brunch- big portions. Large queue but seated fast and well worth the wait
Mymy,"One of the best brunch places I’ve been to, great French toast and other brunch favorites. Coffee was good as well"
Mymy,A lovely place for breakfast with great food and excellent service!
Mymy,"J, we genuinely appreciate you letting us know that you enjoyed your visit, and we will be sure to let the team hear they helped make your time with us so enjoyable. Thank you for your very nice review and rating, and we look forward to serving you again soon."
Mymy,Great spot near Nob Hill in San Fran.  Excellent breakfast options and huge portions.  Very friendly staff
Mymy,I recommend 100%. Absolutely delicious! You'll love literally everything on the menu. Must try!
Mymy,"Very good brunch spot. I had the chilaquiles and they were quite good. Took one star away for the burnt coffee and the fact that this restaurant left the doors wide open when the AQI was recorded at hazardous conditions during the wildfires. Food and service were great, but my poor lungs suffered from doors being propped open."
Mymy,After having a disappointing breakfast at another location. We decide to try this place out. It was delicious. Great food. Nice atmosphere.  Wasn't a long wait. I will definitely comeback again when I'm in San Fran
Mymy,"We appreciate the review, Jason. Thanks for taking the time. It is great to hear that you loved your experience with us. We were happy to serve you and we hope to see you again in the near future!"
Mymy,"A delicious neighborhood spot to enjoy an eclectic menu of great brunch items and the sounds of cable cars on California street. I ordered the shrimp and andouille sausage cheese grits with poached eggs, YUM!"
Mymy,"I visited San Fran in April and stopped here for breakfast one morning. Friendly staff and good breakfasts. It was very busy, but my food was served quickly and I enjoyed it a lot."
Mymy,😋
Mymy,Hi Anthony. Thank you so much for this kind five-star review. We look forward to having you visit us again!
Mymy,Great Gouda Turkey sandwich!
Mymy,Thank you Jason. It's nice to hear you enjoyed your sandwich--our Mymy Monte Cristo--so much! We greatly appreciate your letting us know. We hope to have you back soon!
Mymy,"A favorite destination! The first time I had Mymy’s shrimp & longanisa cheddar grits, it was so memorable that we had to go back just to have it again. Classic diner breakfast vibes with a refreshing twist in the flavors."
Mymy,"There was a line at the entrance, but it was worth it. Quick service after that. Ordered eggs with chorizo and potatoes, which were REALLY GOOD! Would go back!"
Mymy,"That's so nice to hear, Florencia! Thank you for your kind compliments and we hope to see you again soon!"
Mymy,Small queue at opening bode well...weren't disappointed!  Great way to start the day! Came as recommendation and so glad we went with it!  Great food! #GotaEatHere
Mymy,"Fault priced and good food, the wait was not so long without reservations."
Mymy,Hi Sunitha. Thank you so much for the kind rating. We hope you will visit us again some day!
Mymy,"Food was great and service was fast, nice spot for breakfast."
Mymy,"So glad you had a great experience, Mohammad. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Nice spot for brunch. Incredible staff, clean and cute!  They were refilling our coffee at the right time. Potatoes were really crispy,and the omelette was fluffy with generous amount of veggies. French toast was a little dry, but wasn’t too sweet which was good. Loved that it was served with fruit.  We are from out of town, the reviews made it seem like the best brunch in the world, it was good, but just above average."
Mymy,"Sarah, thank you for visiting us! It's nice to see you enjoyed our food, clean space and friendly service. We hope you'll come see us again when you're next back in town!"
Mymy,A little bit pricey but the food was phenomenal. I had their harvest time omelette and a watermelon memosa
Mymy,"Mya, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much. Thank you for your very kind words and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Good food, very homey and comfort based menu with an upscale edge. The staff is friendly,attentive, and helpful. Hometown dinner vibe."
Mymy,"Hi Tom. We are happy to see you enjoy our food, atmosphere, and service so much. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again in the near future. "
Mymy,Worth the wait for sure. Staff was on point and food was delicious. The wait wasn't long even if there was a long line out front. They have indoor and outdoor dining and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived to our table. ❤❤❤
Mymy,"That's wonderful to hear, Jennifer. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Good food and good service.  Everything was top notch.  I would definitely come back!!!
Mymy,"So glad you had a great experience, Christopher. We're delighted you enjoyed both the food and service. Have a great day!"
Mymy,Loved every we ordered.  Fresh food and quick service
Mymy,"Thank you Nadia. It's nice to see you enjoyed your meal and we greatly appreciate your wonderful review. Hopefully, you'll be back soon!"
Mymy,Good Benedict Eggs. Pancakes so so. Price above Average.
Mymy,"Thanks for the great review, Alberto. We're happy you enjoyed your benedict. We look forward to serving you more items you'll love soon!"
Mymy,The Baja California Benedict was incredible. The coffee was delicious and our waittress was very friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend!
Mymy,Amazing spot for brunch. Harvest scramble is delicious
Mymy,"Staying around the area for our San Francisco family trip and after reading the reviews decided to dine in. It was quite a expensive breakfast, we don’t mind waiting in the line for food, but they only have one bathroom and there always a line for it. Before the food came my daughter need to used the bathroom and we wait it at least 20min and by the time we came back the food are cold and didn’t have the appetite for it anymore and it is expensive. Would never go back again Is not worth the wait and money."
Mymy,"Thank you for the visit, Ting. We’re sorry your experience wasn’t the best it could be. We appreciate your feedback and will use this as a chance to improve. With pricing, we are sorry to hear that you feel like the menu items were not the price you were hoping for. We make all our meals to order, with the freshest, best quality ingredients. The price reflects the quality and the handcrafted nature of our food. We hope to see you again sometime soon."
Mymy,"Zucchini pancakes were pretty good, we asked for the potatoes extra crispy and they delivered on that! Servers were friendly. Not amazing but found no reason to lose a star"
Mymy,"Hi Jordan, we’re thrilled to get this kind of feedback. Thank you for taking the time to review us. Glad you liked our food and appreciated our service. See you soon!"
Mymy,"This place was definitely worth the wait! We got a table inside and the atmosphere was great, service was good and food was delicious! I tried the crab cake eggs Benedict and they were so good! It has a delicious lemon dill sauce. Also had the French toast, which was decadent but also delicious. We will definitely be coming back but just have to prepare for a line."
Mymy,"We're thrilled to hear you loved your visit, Kushal and that everything was perfect from food and service to atmosphere! Thank you for coming in and for the nice review, and we hope to see you again soon!"
Mymy,Everything was amazing 🤩 thank you. Service good. Highly recommend this place. …
Mymy,"That's wonderful to hear, Zhanna, thank you so much! We hope to serve you again soon!"
Mymy,Excellent food and service!!! Crab Cake breakfast was delicious
Mymy,Thank you Agnieszka. It's nice to see you enjoyed your meal and that especially our Crab Cake Benedict stood out! We greatly appreciate your visit and review and hopefully you'll be back soon!
Mymy,Yummy!! Had the lemon dill shrimp crab cake Benedict and it was over the top yummy! Great flavor on the hollandaise and the crab cake was plentiful and crispy. Ordered with the potatoes which were a terrific balance of crispy on the outside and airy/creamy inside. Friend had the challah french toast with berries which was also delish! The line moved quickly and we were seated outside (as requested). Did not feel rushed. Service was pleasant and efficient.
Mymy,"Hi Debby, glad to learn your experience was a positive one. Glad you enjoyed our potatoes, toast, benedict, and more. Hope you have an amazing day!"
Mymy,"Spectacular, efficient! Best brunch in USA"
Mymy,"Your generous words are great to hear, Georgina! We're glad you enjoyed your recent visit so much, and hopefully we serve you again soon."
Mymy,"Cozy place, agreeable price, and delicious treats with a lot of options. What else do you want to start your day. Good place to visit!"
Mymy,Food was awesome but service was slow. Very busy as soon as it opens.
Mymy,Amazing Brunch ❤️ Also the staff was very nice 10/10
Mymy,Thank you Michael! That's wonderful to hear and we greatly appreciate your nice review. Hopefully you'll visit us again soon!
Mymy,"Good food, quick and friendly service. 10/10!"
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit, Edgardo! We appreciate your kind review and stellar rating! We hope to have you with us again very soon!"
Mymy,Love this place. Try to sit outside if you can. It gets a little crowded on the inside. That’s the only reason why I’m not giving it five stars. The food is really good and the proportions are plentiful.
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit, nice review, and valuable feedback, Danny. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"A wonderful experience! There was a line when we arrived but it moved quickly. We were seated outside and despite the tables being rather close together, it felt private enough to enjoy conversation.  The food was amazing and not a single person in our group had anything negative to say. The Lattes were also great with a very smooth roast.  We will be back again and look forward to trying more of the menu."
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Matt. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Fried chicken and French toast was great, I had the grits which were also good. To me and my mom they needed some more seasoning. Other than that it was great. Nice crispy fried chicken and French toast."
Mymy,Hi Jose.Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your chicken and toast. We hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"I was pretty disappointed with Mymy. While the presentation of the food was delightful, the service was unsatisfactory. I paid $4 for drip coffee, it came in a tiny little cup, and not once did they come by to see if I needed a refill. The coffee was mediocre at best, anyway. After bringing out my meal, no one came by to check on me until after I was finished eating and it was time to pay. Very poor service! While the lemon dill sauce and shrimp crab cakes were yummy, the bread used for the Benedict was terrible. They use sliced bread rather than the standard English muffin, and the bread was chewy and stale. I doubt that I’ll be back unless they improve things at their restaurant."
Mymy,"Hello John. Thank you for your order and review. Thank you for your compliment on our presentation. We're disappointed that you felt your food was not what you were expecting. Our menu offers an array of menu options made for different types of guests, so if you are ever unsure if a menu item is for you, please contact us and we'd be happy to make some suggestions that suit your taste preference. It’s important for us to know how we can better serve our customers and your comments will be shared with the team. We look forward to serving you again someday for an improved experience!"
Mymy,Best breakfast in SF from a tourist perspective!
Mymy,Hi Cullan.Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"It was excellent and delicious. The ambience was on point.. the only thing, which isn't necessarily a bad thing,  is that it was a bit out of our budget.. but nevertheless you get what you pay for!!"
Mymy,Amazing food!!! Got the salmon tartine and it was delicious.
Mymy,"Hi Leah, we appreciate the positive comment on our tartine. It means a lot. Hope you have an amazing day!"
Mymy,"Lovely place to sit outside, very nice staff and large range of tasty dishes in different styles. Inside seating is not so great though and beverage / cocktails menu is limited."
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit and nice review, Anna. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,I tried their french toast which was like any other French toast & bit over priced as well. They have limited items on their menu. They have indoor & outdoor seating. There was less than 10 mins wait when  I visited them on Sunday morning. Good service from staffs.
Mymy,"Hi Abhi, we wish your experience could have been better, but appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. It’s important for us to know how we can better serve our customers and your comments will be shared with the team."
Mymy,MyMy is definitely a nice place to dine. Great breakfast and latte's. Outside dining was a little cold on a rainy day. But still worth it.
Mymy,Thank you Sean. It's nice to see you enjoyed your meal and we greatly appreciate your visit and review. Hopefully you'll be back soon!
Mymy,My friends and I got different benedicts and they were all pretty good. Red velvet latte was really good
Mymy,"Thank you Nithin. It's nice to see you and your friends enjoyed our Benedicts and Red Velvet Latte, and we greatly appreciate your wonderful review. Hopefully, you'll be back soon!"
Mymy,Great Ube latte and eggs benedict.
Mymy,Hi Brendan. Thank you for your visit and lovely review. It's wonderful to know you enjoyed your latte and Benedict so much. We hope you'll be back again soon!
Mymy,The crab cake Benedict 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾 The mimosa 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
Mymy,Hi Julian. Thank you so much for this kind review. We look forward to having you visit us again!
Mymy,Good for bruch. Wait time is reasonable and food was good.
Mymy,"Hi Dan. Thank you so much for this kind review. We´'re so glad you like our brunch menu, and look forward to having you visit us again sometime soon!"
Mymy,"My husband Andy and I stopped in for breakfast while we were on our honeymoon.  There was a bit of a wait, but we weren't bothered; it was a gorgeous day, and we took it as a good sign that this new place we were about to visit would be amazing.  It absolutely was.  The food was delicious (even if there is something that's just kinda wrong about putting bacon on challah) and the staff were fantastic even though it was a super hectic morning.  Definitely recommend!"
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit and nice review, Katt. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you and your husband again soon!"
Mymy,The best as always. Fresh. Took my friends from out of town and they loved it.
Mymy,"Hi Serena, thank you so much for the kind review. We hope you will visit us again some day!"
Mymy,"Took my family here when they visited the city and we were all impressed. My stepmom said the eggs benedict was the best she'd ever had, and she loved having the option to choose salad as a side over potatoes. I had the banana souffle pancake and highly recommend that as a sweeter option as well!"
Mymy,"Thank you for your order and review, Hailey. It is nice to know you and your family enjoyed your meal. Hopefully we serve you again in the future."
Mymy,"For the amount of tourists that line up here, you'd expect the food to be outstanding. It was lackluster, they left the sticker/ label inside the bottom of water bottle (never cleaned, it had mold). Service was slow due tot the overwhelning people. What a waste of time and money."
Mymy,"Andrew, thank you for your visit. Please accept our apologies if you felt like your experience with us was less-than-ideal. While normally people love our food we understand that not everyone likes the same things. Also, please know that cleanliness and excellent hygiene are top priorities for us and we will look into this right away. We hope to get another chance to impress you someday, and if you do come in please ask for the manager and we will see to it that you have a wonderful experience from start to finish."
Mymy,"My oh my, might I say that Mymy might be my favorite brunch place so far. Memorable, marvelous, munchyful, mouth-gaping, is what Mymy is. Man that's good!"
Mymy,"Nice & cosy little place with alfresco dining as well. Love the ricotta pancakes. 1st visit, will be back for more! Be prepared to queue!"
Mymy,Food was delicious! Staff was super friendly. I was supposed to go somewhere else for breakfast but it was closed and this place popped up nearby. Made my day...
Mymy,"Really good brunches. Very creative, elegant American food."
Mymy,Cute little place with delicious food and drink options. I had a pistachio latte and the Baja California Benedict - such large portions!
Mymy,Mymy offers unique spins on American style breakfast.
Mymy,"Hi Edwin, thank you so much for the kind review. We hope you will visit us again some day!"
Mymy,Always a treat with good food and friendly staff
Mymy,"Thanks for the great review, Tervell. We're glad you enjoy our good food and great service.  Hope you have an amazing day!"
Mymy,Great breakfast with outside dinning
Mymy,"Thank you for your 5-star review, Joe. We appreciate your pleasant comments regarding our food and environment. See you again someday soon!"
Mymy,Tasty breakfast with a great view from the serving outdoor.
Mymy,The place and food are perfect! And also the servers are very kind and polite.
Mymy,Hi Cessna. Thank you so much for the kind review. We hope you will visit us again some day!
Mymy,"Mymy is amazing. Come early to avoid the line, but even if you have to wait, it's worth it. The Monte Cristo Sando is perfection - like a semi-savory French toast. Another review criticises that it's pan- rather than deep-fried, but A) pan frying is actually a more traditional method than deep frying, and B) I've had deep-fried Monte Cristos and they are uniformly soggy and oily. This is light and delicious, with the richness offset beautifully by the cranberry ""aioli"".  Watermelon mimosa was delicious and the fried potatoes as a side are, as always, perfect. Thanks for another excellent breakfast Mymy!"
Mymy,"Really glad you had a positive experience, Kevin. Thanks for reviewing. Nice to know you liked your toasts, mimosas, and others. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
Mymy,"They keep their excellent food quality for years. Mymy is the first option every time when I go back to the city. Plan your time ahead because it always has a long line, but it's worth the wait."
Mymy,I visited this restaurant for the first time. First off they gave me a hard time accepting my digital COVID test. I moved past that. I ordered and when I received my bill I was paying $25 for $18.50 meal not including taxes. I asked the waitress about the charges she then explained fees was added on for extra eggs and I didn’t order extra eggs. My meal came with 2 eggs… No where on the menu stated that and what I ordered was only 18.50. This place is a ripoff and I’m sure whoever has eaten here need to check your bill because I’m sure this is something they do everyday. Most people don’t question their bills at restaurants they just pay them I usually don’t either but it was something about this place that made me look over my bill and sure enough I was overcharged $7 for my meal. This is disgusting and this restaurant will be reported to the BBB. How many other people have they over charged????? This will be on every social media network…. Don’t eat here and if you do check over your bill they will rip you off…
Mymy,"Vina, please know we would never overcharge a customer and welcome you to email your receipt to us, or come in and outline exactly what you ordered. If there was any error made we will quickly take care of it. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you."
Mymy,"It was an excellent dining experience, food was made to perfection, every item on my plate was delicious. I can't give it 6 stars because there's a limit, but I give it a full 5 stars. It will be my breakfast spot every time I visit San Francisco."
Mymy,"Maribel, thank you for your visit and nice review, We're happy to see you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon."
Mymy,This is one of our favorite places for enjoying lunch after Sunday Service in Hillsong Church.
Mymy,This place is great! Food is really exceptional!
Mymy,"Hi N, Thank you for your nice rating! We hope to see you back soon."
Mymy,"Be ready to wait a long time for your food. There was no wait list and we got sat down right away. We ordered our food and never got to try it. After waiting for over 40 minutes to receive our food, we decided to leave. Mind you we were a small party of two. Customer service wasn’t the greatest either. Servers kept walking past us the entire time and not once did they check if we needed anything."
Mymy,"Jacqueline. Thank you for your visit and your patience on any wait you had. While we usually are very good at getting food out quickly, hot off the grill, we apologize if that was not the case during your visit. All our food is made to order, but it should not have taken anywhere near the time you mentioned. Hopefully, we get to serve you again soon for an overall perfect dining experience."
Mymy,"Such friendly attentive service, coupled with delicious, high quality fare, made it a great experience. One of the best Benedicts I've had, really. The eggs were poached to perfection! My friend got a bloody Mary, and while I don't drink often, I had a few sips, and it was super flavorful and well balanced. Will definitely recommend, and will definitely be back😌"
Mymy,Hi! Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you and your friend enjoyed your benedict and Bloody Mary. We hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"100% recommended! Customer service was amazing, food is delicious! We had a 12 people in our party and they were able to accommodate us all! I’ll definitely be back if Im around this area!"
Mymy,"The food is delicious with detailed attention given to a wide variety of food selection. They offer perfectly poached eggs, meaty crab cakes, fresh produce, fresh coffee along with gracious staff. Special efforts are  being given to customer safety with table dividers, distancing and disinfecting. You will enjoy."
Mymy,"I don't get the hype. First, I looked up the ""best hash browns in San Francisco"" and Mymy listed first (was the closest, so that makes sense). Turns out they no longer make hash browns. But secondly, the menu is uninspired. I ultimately ordered the Turkey Monte Cristo (sans aioli) - and they delivered what I can only call french toast with gouda / gruyere cheese and powdered sugar and NO turkey.  I asked where the turkey was and they checked w the kitchen. Turns out you somehow can't get turkey unless you have aioli ... ? ... ?  Anyway, I opted out of breakfast - they kindly gave me an extra Pellegrino gratis.  Service was kind, but nothing exciting on the menu. #HashBrownLover"
Mymy,"Hi Suzanne. We appreciate your visit, but we're unhappy to learn you didn't enjoy our menu as much as most guests do. Please know that our menu offers a variety of options, if ever you receive something that is not what you expected, let us know immediately, so that we can either make you a new version or recommend something else you will better enjoy. We hope to see you again sometime soon."
Mymy,Came for breakfast on a Thursday morning at 9 am. Sat quickly. Food was excellent - did the cottage cheese pancakes and veggie omelette. Service was friendly and quick. Great spot for brunch in the area.
Mymy,Thank you Billy. It's nice to see you enjoyed your meal and we greatly appreciate your visit and review. Hopefully you'll be back soon!
Mymy,"Simply amazing food. We now go EVERY time we come to SF to visit family. They use quality ingredients and every dish I have tried is awesome. The portions are huge. Go hungry! Not cheap, but the value is there. You will leave satiated and happy."
Mymy,Thank you Vickie. That's wonderful to hear and we greatly appreciate your nice review. Hopefully you'll visit us again soon!
Mymy,Staff very rude my food was cold and I wanted to dine in and they made it to go when I sat to eat the lady in the front came and asked me to leave because my food was to go when I told her I never said that she still was rude and told me I cant eat here I feel very judged
Mymy,"Darla, we sincerely apologize if you had what sounds like a less-than-ideal visit with us. Guests who dine in normally wait in line to be seated and have their order taken by a server. It sounds like you may have ordered directly at the counter which may have caused the confusion. Next time you can join us, please ask for a manager so we can make sure you have an excellent experience in every way. Thank you."
Mymy,Highly recommend!
Mymy,Hi Leslie. Thank you so much for this kind review. We look forward to having you visit us again!
Mymy,Really delicious breakfast. Coffee was not the best. Service was good.
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit and nice rating, Alexandra! We love hearing that you enjoyed your food so much and look forward to seeing you again soon!"
Mymy,"The food was okay, nothing different than most other breakfast spots in the area.  The service was bad enough to make me leave this review. If the food is good I usually don't care about service, but it made the breakfast experience bad enough to leave this review. The waitresses were overall rude and seemed like they were doing me a favor by taking me order. And then I was mid coffee drink, and a guy came by to yell at me to put my mask back on. I wear my mask everywhere, but how am I going to drink my coffee with it on? When my food came I wasn't sure if he'd come back and yell again because I had it off to eat."
Mymy,"Azur, thank you for coming in.  Please accept our apologies if you felt like the service was not ideal. We truly pride ourselves in great customer service, so we will certainly look into what  may have happened and make sure it never happens again and we want you to know that next time you visit us the service will be perfect. Hopefully we'll get a chance to serve you again sometime soon."
Mymy,Incredible food and staff. Line moves faster than it looks!
Mymy,"Emily, thank you for your patience on any wait you had. You are right that the line does move faster than it looks@! We're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much and we appreciate your very kind words! Hopefully we'll see you back soon."
Mymy,"Oh so amazing. Rarely do I find brunch places that are worthy of a review. This place was worth the wait in the queue for their perfectly fine eggs,  nicely tasted bread and oh so amazing house potatoes (yes the potatoes deserve a callout here - very unusual). I ordered the lobster omelette and everything was perfectly done. We ordered pancakes for the table and they were soft and did not loose their texture to the toppings. :)"
Mymy,"The food served Quite fast,but wait long time for the seat. Not reservation . Small space, rare distance with next table."
Mymy,"王麗玲, thank you for joining us. We are pleased to know you enjoyed our food, and thank you for your patience on any wait you had in being seated. We hope to have you back soon."
Mymy,"We started ordering weekend brunch from MyMy during quarantine and now we order our favorite breakfast every weekend! I would argue they have the best crispy potatoes in the entire city! Even with our food being delivered everything is always fresh, still warm and the portions are insane! I can’t say enough good things about their food n service!"
Mymy,Cozy atmosphere. Delicious food ! I literally liked here.
Mymy,If you wanna have a good breakfast come to Mymy. I ordered Banana soufflé Pancakes with a regular house made coffee. Everything was so delicious! What I really liked it is how the pancakes tasted. They were fluffy and not too sweet. Service was good as well.  I would love to come back!
Mymy,"Not too bad of a wait, fast friendly service, good food"
Mymy,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch yesterday.  Ordered the Mymy with 2 eggs, zucchini pancakes, potatoes and bacon.   Coffee, service and cost was excellent all the way around.  Short wait in line was well worth it!"
Mymy,"Significant wait in line, but they refill your coffee! Good breakfast spot. The potatoes were delicious and the egg scramble very unique."
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Jackie. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"The seating areas are a little small but the food was bountiful and delicious. Their menu had great variety. We had crab cakes, french toast, blueberry and banana pancakes, sausage and scrambled eggs. We shared family style and it was a great way to really get to see the full range of the menu. I would certainly come back here if I were in the neighborhood again."
Mymy,"This is my favorite brunch restaurant in the whole entire world. Every time I am in San Francisco I try to come back to this restaurant. I literally dream about their crispy golden brown potatoes, their steaming zucchini pancakes, and their fresh fruit juices. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and their great service. Always worth the wait."
Mymy,Oh Mymy!!! Excellent restaurant. Unexpectedly delicious twists on the foods you already know and love.
Mymy,The crab cakes and red velvet latte were awesome. I love that everything is out quickly and the location was nice.
Mymy,Hi A.. Thank you so much for the kind rating. We hope you will visit us again some day!
Mymy,Overpriced and over hyped. Waited in line only to receive cold eggs. Diner vibes and champagne prices.
Mymy,"Christina, thank you for taking the time to share this feedback. We’re sorry to hear we did not meet your expectations. Hopefully we'll have the chance to serve you again someday and help you find items you love. "
Mymy,"Just wow great breakfast. The line can turn people off, but worth it, and you can game it by getting there 10 minutes before opening and usually will sit right down. Highlights for us: Challah French Toast, Banana Souffle Pancake, Salmon Tartine. Can't wait to go back and try more."
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Tim. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Best place by far to have brunch in this area! I ordered the French Toast and my husband got the corn hash and it was on point. We got mimosas to wash it down. Overall great place and affordable! There can be a line outside but it goes by fairly quickly. Food was great! Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.
Mymy,Food was great but I rated it a 2 due to the lack of attention and service given to me while  compared to our customers around me. I had to grab my own cream and sugars before my coffee got cold. I was more upset that I asked the lady with a coffee jug  for more coffee and she clearly ignored me. I didn't leave a tip and just wanted to say thanks to the cooks. Staff needs to treat all customers EQUAL.
Mymy,We were lucky to go on a day the City was empty as it was a holiday weekend. Love those days. I had the lemon soufflé pancakes. It was so good an fluffy. I typically don’t care for pancakes as they’re too dense. These were perfect. My friend had the eggs Benedict and said the potatoes were very very good. Well seasoned. I recommend this place for breakfast.
Mymy,I LOVED my challah French toast and red velvet latte.
Mymy,"Wondering brunch place, great food and great service"
Mymy,Hi Genevieve. We are happy to see you enjoy our food and service so much. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again in the near future. 
Mymy,"Outstanding service, delicious food-- more upscale than typical diner food. Fair prices, good portions. Perfectly cooked eggs. Potatoes are great, but very rich! Go early on weekends or expect a long wait, as they don't take reservations."
Mymy,High quality! I miss their hash browns even though the home fries are good and crispy. No vegetarian menu items but everything I've asked for to be made vegetarian has been good. Friendly and accommodating even in the insanity of Sunday brunch but you can avoid the wait by visiting on a week day.
Mymy,"Amazing food.  Absolutely top notch.  We had both savory and sweet dishes, both were well prepared.  This was exactly what I had hoped for.  They presented us with big portions of delicious, creative, comfort food.  The service was casual, but attentive.  But...  there was one minor missed mark. Unfortunately, their espresso was quite sub par, lacking even a hint of a crema.  This was disappointing, since there was so much attention to quality in the food.  So, my recommendation is to go there for the amazing food, but stop at a real coffee shop before or after if quality espresso is important to you.  This is a new breakfast favorite for when I return to the area."
Mymy,best corned beef hash i've ever had. get here early to get in when they open. food and service were great. really liked it.
Mymy,"Hi Stephanie, we’re thrilled to get this kind of feedback. It is nice to hear that you enjoyed our delicious hash, great service. Have a wonderful day!"
Mymy,"MyMy..was different there was confusion concerning the menu, however my Crab Cake Eggs Benedict were heavenly although one menu advertised it with shrimp but that ole potato showed up instead. The staff were attentative and friendly..the place small and quaint but very doable. Check into to it if yiu get the chance."
Mymy,Thank you for coming in Scott. We are sorry to hear if there was some confusion over the menu but are happy that you found our Crab Cake Benedict delicious and that the service was friendly. We hope to serve you again soon!
Mymy,"I love Mymy! Brunch is so good here, I always want to eat here when I crave brunch food but they’re also always busy with lines but I get delivery and it’s just as good. :)"
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Hannah. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed brunch with us. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"Parmesan crusted zucchini pancakes were extraordinary, slightly crisped on the outside but so moist on the inside. With the real maple syrup that comes with it, it was heavenly. Also very much so enjoyed the omelet with avocado, chicken sausage, leaks and onions. Very flavorful without having to rely on ridiculous levels of salt. Overall one of my favorite breakfast joints I've ever been to and would definitely recommend."
Mymy,Oh! I am going to miss this eggs benedict with crab. So yummy !!!!
Mymy,"The place was overflowing but we were seated rather quickly. The food came surprisingly quickly and was absolutely delicious.  Sidenote: 10/10 do recommend the pistachio latte-- it wasn't overly sweet, which is hard to find in fancy flavored coffee drinks."
Mymy,Restaurant is ran by very prejudice people. They literally avoided serving us because we were minorities and had zero remorse about it. Would never go back and I highly recommend that people of color/minorities avoid buying breakfast from them. There’s plenty of better restaurants in SF that are friendly to minorities and other groups of people. Mymy is a filthy place and I’ve heard they aren’t the cleanest either (ooops)
Mymy,"Cute outdoor seating section. Went here for brunch for the first time with a couple friends. The servers are super sweet and do their best to make you feel welcome and comfortable. I got the build your own scramble. It wasn't anything special but it was tasty. I enjoyed their fruit bowls because they contain a big variety of fruits, not your typical grapes and melon."
Mymy,"Great place for breakfast.  Good portions, decent prices (especially for San Fran), with friendly and attentive staff.  If you want to avoid the line that builds, I recommend arriving when they open, or wait for after 10am (brunch!).  The French toast, corn beef hash, and TexMex plates are all excellent.  I have not eaten lunch here yet, will have to try that next time."
Mymy,"Faster service and comfortable place to eat. The friendly staff makes you feel welcomed. The lemon souffle pancakes were tasty, green chilaquiles tasted fresh and delicious. I will come back again when visiting. Definitely worth stopping by."
Mymy,We were walking around San Francisco and just decided to try this place. We are glad we did. A small place with not much seating but the service was nice and quick.  Our breakfast was hot and delicious.  My girlfriend got the banana soufle pancake and I got the chilaquiles verde. A great place we chose on our vacation.
Mymy,Absolutely the worst and most exspensive brunch I’ve had in the city! The mimosas were the only thing I enjoyed and they were way overpriced. Might as well go to sweet maple or new village cafe at least you will eat the food you buy.
Mymy,The wait staff is so sweet and the service is excellent. Went with some friends for brunch and though the breakfast menu was very unique and the dishes were presented beautifully the food was average. The eggs tasted artificial and the vanilla sponge french toast was underwhelming. Also bottomless mimosas are only available during the week--which I think is pretty odd. All in all I would be willing to give mymy another shot...maybe for lunch.
Mymy,"Unreal breakfast, salmon tartoline SO delicious"
Mymy,"Hi Joshua. We are happy to see you enjoyed our breakfast so much, particularly our Salmon Rotolone Tartine. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again soon. "
Mymy,"Very prejudice restaurant. My husband and I (people of color) were waiting in line to be seated and the hostess completely ignored us and served the guests behind us (non-people of color). When we said that we were waiting in line for 20 minutes in front of the people that they were trying to seat, they ignored us. The people that they were trying to seat were confused as well and told the hostess that we were there first, but the hostess just stood there in disbelief. My husband and I ended up getting out of line and left. We were extremely disgusted by Mymy's behavior..."
Mymy,"Lemon Chiffon Pancakes. All you need to know is, Lemon Chiffon Pancakes.....GO! Run, don't walk....Mymy is a Lower Nobb Hill treat,  only a block off Polk's shopping strip, this quiet corner is home to one of the areas busiest restaurants. Many reasons why,  from great food to good service. Lots of outdoor seating!.. but O think it is the Lemon Chiffon Pancakes. Wink. Trust me."
Mymy,Great place for having breakfast/Brunch. Big portions.
Mymy,"That's very kind of you to say, Lorena. Thank you for your visit and wonderful review! We're happy to know you like our breakfast/brunch so much, and we hope to see you back again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,Great food variety and very tasty food. I had the crab cakes and they are really worth the hype. Also friendly customer care service and tasty coffee
Mymy,"Great food and service, loved the shrimp and crab cake Benedict, so lovely."
Mymy,"Visited on a Sunday morning, although there was a line because our party was only two we were seated quickly. Most dishes come with fried potatoes I can say best I've ever had, they were lightly seasoned, texture on the outside of the potato was firm yet soft in the inside. And the raspberry jam which is placed on each table was a great hint of sweetness if you weren't having French toast or anything similar."
Mymy,Such a cute little brunch place. The French toast was amazing!
Mymy,"They have a nice brunch menu, and really great service. I always appreciate when places that serve coffee do it diner-style and just keep pouring from the brew pot rather than charging you an extra $2 each time you get a refill. Got here around 9:30am on Saturday and once we were seated (immediately) a huge line began to form, so come earlier to avoid the brunch rush."
Mymy,The food and mimosas were amazing. Service was fast. I suggest the French toast.
Mymy,"Hi Jasmyne. Thank you for your visit and nice comments! We're happy to know you enjoyed our food and mimosas so much, and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,"This place has amazing selection of brunch dishes, both sweet and savory. I would recommend the Norwegian Benedict and the Salmon tartine. Their coffee is also better than most places. The wait is also not horrible if you don't show up in prime brunch time. We arrived at 1pm on a Sunday and there were barely 2 people ahead of us."
Mymy,"The food is good but the business all in all felt very dishonest. The service was also very slow where our drinks didn’t come after our food was served.  They included tips into the bill and we are doubled tipped. The bill came out ridiculously high, on average everyone paid 28 dollars for the brunch for about 19 dollars of food. I think it’s fine to have mandatory tips when the party is large. But it’s just a good rule to have it stated on the menus or somewhere, not just slip it in like this. Very disappointed to see this in San Francisco."
Mymy,Best barging in town for breakfast.  Good and generous portions.  Quick service and attentive.  A little bit of a wait in line outside so if it is raining bring umbrella.  The only thing that it lacks is real cocktails.  I like bloody Mary's at brunch. But the champagne served us well.
Mymy,"I was sort of surprise how I enjoyed MyMy Restaurant because I really stopped there to wait on a friend who was away from his gift shop, Terrasol, that's recently opened a few doors away. By happenstance, I decided to order from the online menu that's required so I could pick and choose exactly what I wanted which was the hot crab cakes over a bed of spinach with a wonderful sauce on top, a bunch of long but thin sauteed asparagus, and two links of chicken apple sausage which were all to die for. I should have chased it with a glass of Rose, but decided to go with a coke. It really is a great spot for a quick brunch or late afternoon lunch. And I tip my hat to the chef/cook and the pleasant staff whom I was pleased to liberally tip. It's a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10."
Mymy,My favorite SF breakfast. Great offerings fantastic service.  No pics too engaged with awesome experience
Mymy,Perfect breakfast.  The potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Coffee was good too.
Mymy,"Mymy is my favorite spot for lunch and brunch in SF. I've gotten a different dish each of the 6 times I've been, and each one has been extremely high quality. I'd recommend anyone in the area to go here."
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Matt. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you've enjoyed your meals during the multiple visits. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Crazy long lines during the weekend for brunch – highly recommend regardless. The seafood egg dishes are always amazing. Their french toast is also a staple. Their dirty matcha/chai is also really good!
Mymy,"Ordered blt Benedict with the potatoes. The bread is under the eggs. I dont know if it was that i was hungry or that it was the first thing I ate after being up since 330am till 10am. But the food was delicious and very fresh. I was in the area and a friend recommended that I stop by. I was hesitant as there was a line of about 10 people standing under the sun crisping up yet i trotted along and waited. With much delight i feasted on some of the most decadent of ingredients. At about 16 a plate you get what you pay for here.  Bottom line, the dish was good and worth it."
Mymy,Recently had the Frisco scramble and was pleasantly surprised with the flavors. Apple and hints of cinnamon occasionally presented while biting into the egg scramble. Staff was attentive and pleasant. Country potatoes with the proper crisp and remnants of smoked bacon sealed the deal for another visit. Chatter from the other diners confirmed that menu variety was equally appreciated. Arrived before 9am on a weekday and no line.
Mymy,"Loved it! The menu was extensive and unique, all the food we got was great. Breakfast sandwich had the best garlic aioli and the bun was awesome, along with the toast that came with other dishes. Challah French toast was great as well. Would definitely recommend if you’re in the area"
Mymy,"A cute breakfast place on the corner with outdoor and indoor dining. But sit outside when the weather is nice. The breakfast was tasty and the service was great. I just wish it wasn't on a main street with all the honking and fumes nearby, man if it was trash day....sit inside lol"
Mymy,"We were lucky enough that we arrived right before the line started forming so we got one of the last tables outside which was perfect since it was such a sunny warm day. Apparently this is hard to get at this place so recommend going early if you don't want to wait too long. The food was good but nothing surprising; really big quantities, but we didn't feel super well after it hence my lower rating."
Mymy,"0 stars for service. Waitress didn't deliver our food until asked (people seated after us had food). Food served cold with no apology, seated outside so no one came to check on us about how things were until waitress served the check. Had the egg benedict and hollandaise sauce congealed but potatoes were good. I love potatoes."
Mymy,Good brunch place that has decent brunch food staples and some brunch items with a twist. Crab cake Benedict's were delicious and filling. Came during the holiday and had no wait like most others have had to deal with. Service is quick and friendly.
Mymy,Loved their food and service was wonderful.
Mymy,"Probably the best brunch place in San Francisco. Be prepared to wait for an hour to get a seat, especially if you have a large party. The service is quick and efficient. This is our go-to place to take our out-of-town friends when they visit. A bit pricey but I think is great value for money. Their Mimosas are pretty goods as well."
Mymy,The food was great and I had a red velvet coffee was so delicious
Mymy,"Ho boy. We ordered the pancakes, and were given these DELICIOUS pancakes overlying a stiffed egg-white layer with blueberries or a smooth and delightful lemon taste. It was absolutely fantastic although very much unexpected. A bit pricey, but really worth the price."
Mymy,"I LOVED this place for breakfast when I traveled to San Fransisco for a work conference. Amazing food, I went back right next day. Excellent coffee and service is fast but I did not feel rushed out the door. Welcoming and attentive service both days I was there. Excellent choice."
Mymy,Feel so very fortunate to have My My my just around the corner from where we live.  The food is consistently great 🙏🏼 though a bit pricy 👀 but it's never disappointing.  Feel quite safe eating on the outdoor seating areas with our dogs Emma and Medgar …
Mymy,Hi Henry. We're glad you came by with your dogs to dine with us. We appreciate your generous comments on our food and atmosphere. See you again soon!
Mymy,Best breakfast of the trip! Super nice servers and you can catch the cable car right at the corner to take in breathtaking views of Nob Hill! I suggest any eggs benedict with crispy potatoes at this bright spot.on the corner with indoor and outdoor seating.
Mymy,Great spot with a very fun menu. We had challah French toast and brisket hash and both were super tasty. Bloody Mary's are nice too.
Mymy,"Popular with locals, I went here with my daughter as recommended by my hotel. I chose wrong with the chilaquiles, which were super acidic and not good. The challah French toast was much better.  Espresso drink was meh. Service good.  I think the kitchen staff should taste the food every day to make sure that it's on point beyond that I would try it again"
Mymy,"there's almost always going to be a line, and the service is such that you kind of want to order everything up front"
Mymy,"Jeremy, thank you for your patience on any wait you've had. Please know our servers work hard to be efficient so there is less of a line, but you can always add to your order if you desire. We hope you will be back again soon. "
Mymy,"Best breakfast food in the neighborhood.  Highly recommend the corned beef hash.  Quick and friendly service once you do get seated.  There is usually a line outside at peak weekend brunch hours (goes quick if you only have 2 people).  But both the coffee and espresso are absolutely terrible.  Some of the worst I've had.  No amount of milk, cream, or sugar can save either of them.  The food makes up for it."
Mymy,"The food was by far one of the best I've ever had for a brunch place. It has now become one of my favorites since brunch hopping in San Francisco. Definitely recommend if you're on the fence. Mimosas were great as well, a craft filled with champaign and a splash of orange juice. Happy eating!"
Mymy,"good service, clean and very good food🍱 …"
Mymy,"Hi Estela. We are happy to see you enjoy our food, atmosphere, and service so much. Thank you! for the kind review and rating. We look forward to serving you again in the near future. "
Mymy,"The food was delicious! Great customer service, they have inside and outside seating this is a must to visit I highly recommended."
Mymy,"Hi Diego, we’re thrilled to get this kind of feedback. Thank you for taking the time to review us. It is great to hear that you liked both our food and service. See you next time!"
Mymy,"We came in at 9 on a Saturday an snaghed the last open table for two. The choices were mouth-watering, I ordered the Frisco Scramble. The service was fast and efficient, the space is small, but not uncomfortable. The potatoes are so delicious I can't even describe them, I wanted to eat just potatoes forever. When we left there was a line forming, so get there on the earlier side and you should be fine."
Mymy,"Outstanding food in a snug little cafe/diner setting. Reasonably priced, with good service. I had the Challa bread French toast and I was not disappointed! The fruit was some of the freshest and best I've tasted in the area."
Mymy,"Was delicious, honestly some the best breakfast I've had!! Will definitely be returning."
Mymy,"Hi Vanessa, glad to learn your experience was a positive one. Hope you have an amazing day!"
Mymy,"Such huge portions! Good food, good service, all in all a great place to go for brunch."
Mymy,"We appreciate the positive feedback, Stella. It means a lot. We're ecstatic to hear that you enjoyed the taste and portions of our menu items, as well as our service. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,"The food is really good but the prices, which were already on the high side, have been increased recently. The service is not great. They rush you in placing your order and then never come back to refill coffee or ask if you need anything. Still it's very popular so you'll probably have to wait in line."
Mymy,"Delicious food, chill vibe, great service"
Mymy,"Hi Matt. We are happy to see you enjoy our food, vibe, and service so much. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again in the near future."
Mymy,Great place and better food to start the day
Mymy,The Lattes are decadent! I ordered the red velvet and it was like a cupcake as a coffee drink. The Baja California eggs Benedict is the best breakfast I’ve ever had. Best breakfast potatoes. Hands down anywhere!! My boyfriend ordered the Salmon tartine and it was Gorgeous. The food looks as good as it tastes. This was our last morning one San Fran and I wish we ate here the first day because I would have eaten every meal here. :) we were lucky enough to sit outside in Gorgeous sunny weather. You won’t be disappointed coming here!
Mymy,The best breakfast I’ve had. The lemon cottage cheese pancakes are so good.
Mymy,"Jason, we’re so happy to hear you loved the pancakes. Hope to see you again in the near future!"
Mymy,"Been here for breakfast a few times and was not disappointed on any visit. Food is excellent, service was fast and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Huge range on the menu including sweet and savoury meals, would definitely recommend giving this place a visit."
Mymy,"It was 8:50 Monday morning and we waited until Mymy opens to try their breakfast menu. Instead we saw how the workers have complete disregard to the safety and wellbeing of their outdoor dining. They did not bother to sweep nor wash nor disinfect each outdooor booth. In one of the booths was sleeping a homeless person with all his baggages. When it becomes clear to him that the girls are ready to setup tables and chairs, he got up and slowly walked away. I was expecting that the workers would wash or at least sweep the flooring. But no. They were rushing to put up tables and chairs. The same with the other booths, I saw wet spots in the flooring, yellowish fluid right by the crack of the flooring to the curb. The workers are not bothered. We just then decided to sit and have pastry and coffee at Souvenirs after that disgusting discovery."
Mymy,I’ve been to Mymy a few times for brunch with friends! It’s one of the ultimate brunch spots in SF and is super popular on weekends so expect a wait. Everything I’ve had has been delicious but I would give it 4 stars since it’s a bit over-priced.
Mymy,"usually no wait if you go before 10am. otherwise, the food is well worth the price and the line. portions are large and satisfying; the potatoes are delicious. try the corned beef hash and the souffle pancakes!"
Mymy,Omg sitting here now just taking my sweet time to fully enjoy this amazing breakfast
Mymy,Delicious coffee & French toast. Soufflé pancakes not great
Mymy,"Ate there on Sunday afternoon after a Giants game. Line was long, but moved swiftly. The servers and waitresses were spectacular. The food was terrific."
Mymy,Thank you Robert. That's wonderful to hear and we greatly appreciate your nice review. Hopefully you'll visit us again soon!
Mymy,"Jalapeno Chorizo Tartine was delicious. The potatoes exceeded all expectations, especially when paired with the jelly/paste/I don't know what in a jar on the table. Friendly, fast, professional service. I'm only visiting, but if I find myself in the area again, I'll most certainly come back."
Mymy,"Nothing particularly special about this restaurant. I am surprised there are so many positive reviews.  Wait times may be a bit lower than some other brunch places in SF, but you might as well find a popular diner for same wait times with better food."
Mymy,"*Speedy polite service, *varied around the globe menu, * food very well prepared and served fresh, * I liked that I saw staff taking time to disinfect chairs backs as well as tables between table turns, * just watch out for the pre-sweetened cashew coffee ... especially if you trying to quit sugar! My oops for not checking in advance, but it sure did look good!"
Mymy,"The worst french toast ever. They gave me very dry, cold, undelicious toast. It tasted like they made it a while ago and just microwaved and served me. I still can’t believe they actually served that kind of quality food here in San Francisco. ofc I didn’t finish it. I feel like I threw away my money $16.28. My first lunch in SF was totally ruined and felt really bad."
Mymy,We were recommended this brunch place by our Hotel Manager. She was spot on as it is a delightful place with good brunch fare and brisk service. We tried zucchini pancakes and omelette with Hash browns and loved both dishes. Good find
Mymy,"Get there before it opens and get inline for a Sunday. Several outdoor seating areas and limited indoor for covid safety at the time. I had the challah french toast and coffee, both were delicious! Plus a mimosa carafe to share"
Mymy,"Thank you for your visit and nice review, Laura. We're happy to see you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon."
Mymy,"Amazing food. Stood in line for 20 minutes in the most beautiful day..so worth the wait. Food was incredible.. Crispy potatoes, eggs, fresh crab, shrimp, avacodos.... Best restaurant on the trip!!!"
Mymy,"Decent food, so so service. Woman seating people has a seriously crap attitude, wouldn't let us sit and order at our table because one person was still parking (even though we were ready to order their food too). Probably won't go back there for that kind of treatment. I'd say any other cafe near by is just as good with a much more welcoming attitude. These guys just want to take your money and do the bare minimum work to keep you from thinking they are complete jerks."
Mymy,Delicious brunch as usual. The Benedict’s are always solid but the sweet griddle options hit the spot as well.
Mymy,Hi Dat. Thank you for your visit and generous rating! We're glad to know you enjoyed your meal and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"A wonderful spot for breakfast. Great food, delicious drinks, & outdoor safe seating. Happy to have discovered this gem on our trip. Will be a regular on our West Coast visits."
Mymy,"Nice looking menu but it didn't translated well to the plate. The benedict with salmon was a bit over the top with ingredients making it unfocused and a little messy. Scrambled eggs on the other hand was more of the opposite, but the hash brown was exciting! Maybe had to high expectations after reading all the reviews."
Mymy,Ive never giving a restaurant 5 stars but oh how they deserve it food was delicious clean and tables were spaced out i felt comfortable host was friendly we had a big order and we got our food fast..
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Lamont. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Tasty brunch spot. I got the eggs Benedict.
Mymy,"Hi Sean, thank you for the kind review. We hope you will visit us again some day!"
Mymy,"For some reason, San Francisco brunch spots rarely have HASH BROWNS. It's mostly country potatoes.  I love my hash browns for brunch, and MyMy cooks them PERFECTLY. Ultra thin, extra crispy browns.  Tips - -No reservations :( -whole party needs to be there before you get seated"
Mymy,"This is one of my favorite spots for breakfast/brunch.  The service is incredibly quick and the food is delicious.  They have fresh squeezed orange juice as well.  My favorite things here are the french toast and the pulled pork chile verde scramble.  The french toast doesn't always fill me up, so I tend to order a side of two scrambled eggs with cheese.   When I order the scramble, I'm always left super full and satisfied.  There's usually a line here, but since the staff is so efficient, things tend to move quickly."
Mymy,I loved this place for years.  The food is fantastic the service is adequate and I have been going here regularly for the last 6 years. I take all my visitors here when they come into town.  However today I was treated so rude I am not sure I will ever return. When I entered with my daughter I was told I could either sit outside (45 degrees) or sit with strangers because they wouldn't seat us at their only open table which was a four top. Needless to say I left very mad and I may never return and now I'm sad. They need to take care of their loyal local customers and they failed.
Mymy,"I'm not a big brunch person like 99.9% of this City, and I hate waiting in lines. But MyMy is one of the places I will wait in line for. The lemon souffle pancakes are the perfect mix of sweet, fluffy, and tangy. The hashbrowns are indeed amazing for those who want the minimal interior to exterior ratio to maximize crunch. I like how the inside of the restaurant looks homey and like a old coffee shop.  The wait is horrible, especially in the 10am-12pm hours, but put your name on the list, head up to Trader Joe's to do some shopping, or grab some coffee at Contraband and the time will fly."
Mymy,"WARNING: GRATUITY AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED. Don’t get tricked into double tipping them. Read the bill carefully. Food is good, service is terrible. Waitress kept trying to walk away when I was asking her questions."
Mymy,Delightful and Delicious... Enjoyed both the breakfast (eggs Benedict) and brunch (Seafood salad).  Excellent service and delicious food. Fair price. Can't wait to go back.
Mymy,The corned beef dish was great but lacked protein...mostly potatoes. The challah french toast was also delicious. Skip the pistachio latte.
Mymy,"Hi Shone, thank you for coming in. We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal and we hope to see you back again some day in the near future!"
Mymy,Super delicious egg benedict. Long queue all the time.
Mymy,"Overestimated and overpriced. 64 $ for 2 people, food pretty good, awful coffee"
Mymy,"Igor, we are pleased to see you enjoyed your meal. Thank you. Please know our prices are based on using the highest-quality ingredients and paying our staff a livable wage. Even so, we are still competitive in cost with other top bruch restaurants in the area. We hope to see you again someday."
Mymy,"Nice place, good location and pleasant setup. Food and service were ok. The hot chocolate was great! Wouldn’t mind going again."
Mymy,"Super quick, nice staff, fantastic OJ and large portions. The egg white veggie omelette I ordered was delicious!! However it is quite pricy in our opinion and finding a seat is difficult as it is a small place and quite busy!"
Mymy,We had Fench toast with fruit and mascarpone cream and syrup that was wonderful.  Their fried potatoes and grilled asparagus were also great.we didn't try them but they seemed to specialize in eggs Benedict.
Mymy,good food. not the friendliest service.
Mymy,"Brunch is usually a long wait, maybe one hour on nice sunny days. they only seat you if you're entire group is there. Their hash browns are pretty unique. I would recommend going to Belcampo in Russian Hill instead if you're not in the mood to wait."
Mymy,"Great breakfast variations and very tasty dishes. Be prepared to come early and wait in queue for a table. It is a very popular place in the neighborhood and even beyond it. Prices are ok, it is still SFO. Highly recommended"
Mymy,The Salmon Tartine knocked my socks off! Huge portion with lots of flavor - I didn't want to stop eating it! Definitely suggest this place if there's a seat available!
Mymy,"Wow.  The line out front was a bit daunting,   but the food was well worth it.  Everything from the omelet to the home fried potatoes exceeded expectations.   Best breakfast we had in SF by far."
Mymy,"This is a cute little breakfast spot that I visit pretty often. During the week they have unlimited mimosas. Also, this place has pancakes, and eggs benedict that will make you want to eat here everyday. The wait might be 20 miniutes but it's so worth it, the servers are nice, and the food is even better!"
Mymy,"Nice breakfast cafe, quite crowded but good service and very tasty breakfast and good cappuccino"
Mymy,"Hi Thomas. Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your breakfast and cappuccino, and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,"It looks better than it tastes, especially for the SF pricing. Service wasn't amazing, but they were also swamped. I don't plan to go out of my way to eat there again."
Mymy,"After looking at the gorgeous hash browns pics I decided to go to Mymy. The wait for 2 people wasnt too bad and the waiter was very accommodating.  As I was about to finish my order, my waiter said: ""we no longer serve hash browns"". Damn, well I guess I'll just have the home fries with my crab & shrimp cakes benedict. Other than the fact that they no longer serve hash browns, the food was great."
Mymy,"The menu is very unique and totally gourmet.  I went there for brunch. We had to wait in line for a bit, but it was totally worth it.  Service was very fast and our food came out right away.  I ordered the pain de mie french toast which was phenomenal."
Mymy,"This place was very delicious and the wait was definitely manageable. I recently moved back to the Bay and I've notices that it's normal to stand in line for over an hour for good brunch on the weekend, like when did that happen? So to find a really good place that has a much shorter wait I consider a win and it definitely deserves 5 stars for that reason.  It's a small place inside with some outside seating. The decorations are very homey and their menu has lots of eggs benedicts. I got a tex mex, which was a super delicious omelette with sooo much avocado on top. Oh how much i missed california for it's abundance of avocados. Te only thing I would critique is their coffee, but I came for the food and not the drinks and was very satisfied."
Mymy,"Great food, good service and comforting flavors."
Mymy,One of the best breakfast/brunch places in San Francisco!!
Mymy,"This small place in Nob Hill would be one my favorite brunch places in San Francisco if only the line was shorter. I went with a friend of mine during a weekend and we didn't wait as long as the waitress had predicted.  I had the Parma Flavor which deserves an A+. The hollandaise sauce is balanced and the taste is delicate; the eggs were perfectly poached and even though the flavor of mozzarella was not very detectable, the ensemble of the flavors makes this dish very yummy. The hash brown make me think about rosti, which I love.  I also had the Banana Mascarpone pancakes which were fine but nothing to write home about. I couldn't detect the banana as the pancake filling was somewhat bland.  The service is quick and the price is fair. They don't have a steamer so no hot milk, which I realize it's a 1st world problem :)"
Mymy,"Very good (and fast) service. Excellent food, really difficult to make a choice. Went with the parma eggs benedict and wasn't disappointed. Reviews frequently mention long lines. I went in a Thursday at 8AM and was the only one in the cafe."
Mymy,Good food and attentive service. The line moves fast
Mymy,"The owner of Griddle Fresh also runs MyMy - so you can get your soufflé pancakes, hashed browns, and 6-hour corned beef hash fix at either place!  Goodness, is this place popular! When I arrived at MyMy's on a Sunday around 10:30am, there were twelve parties on the list ahead of me by the time I had written my name down on the clipboard. The line moved at a fairly steady pace though and probably waited about 30-40 minutes before being seated for our party of two.  Service was quick, although the food was not on par with Griddle Fresh. The soufflé pancakes lost their soufflé factor and were very flat. The BLT Eggs Benediction was decent, but was plated rather sloppily. Minus one star.  Ambiance-wise, MyMy's felt very compared to its sister restaurant. The servers are are hardworking but are zipping back and forth, which doesn't make for a relaxed brunch experience, which is why I have to dock a star.  Still, there's nothing wrong with this establishment. The waitresses are courteous and efficient, and the food is still decent. However, if given the choice on a weekend morning, I'd opt for Griddle Fresh in the less chaotic Noe Valley."
Mymy,"Best breakfast in San Fran, they are fast, yummy and courteous. Get there early if you don't want to wait in line. and if you like latte's do have the pistachio latte, its to die for. The hot chocolate is also a fav."
Mymy,"Great breakfast/brunch spot: incredible food and service. Expect to wait 10-30 min for a table but it's more than worth it, especially if you sit outside. Their potatoes rock!"
Mymy,Great breakfast! I had the lemon pancakes. So fluffy and lemony with fresh fruit. 😍 Challah french toast was delish too. Next time I'll try one of the egg dishes. …
Mymy,Super fast and attentive service. The food came out very quickly too. I ordered the Tex Mex Scrambler. The portion was huge and well plated. Overall food was good. I would recommend. Good variety on the menu.
Mymy,"After coming across horrendous wait times at some other brunch spots, and changing our minds multiple times about the kind of cuisine we wanted, my friend and I eventually settled on the traditional-ish brunch fare at Mymy. After something like a 30-45min wait, we nabbed a seat outside, and ordered their:  * Vanilla Sponge French Toast - While I was definitely craving something more savory than sweet, it's always hard to resist the more ""typical"" carby brunch items. Ordered this with a side of bacon to try and balance the scales a bit, to little avail. Their French toast, while light, fluffy, and tasty, was on the too-sweet side due to the butterscotch drizzle: and that's even WITH the bacon. Take out the butterscotch though, and it was pretty solid.  * Parma-Flavored Eggs Benedict - This is what I wish I HAD ordered instead. Perfect poached eggs (the ones where the yolks are more gooey than runny), fantastic flavor, and just all around delicious. I actually tried a bite of this with my French toast, and it went surprisingly well together!  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - I can't speak to the inside of the venue, since we opted to sit outside, but outdoor seating wasn't the best option given that it's situated on a hill, so you'll be fighting against gravity, either upwards or downwards.  Bathroom - No comment, since I didn't try them."
Mymy,Had the French toast and it was delish. A bit of a queue outside but didn’t have to wait for more than 5/10mins. Staff was super nice and friendly when making recommendations on the menu. Definitely recommended!
Mymy,Food was alright but the service was horrible! First we waited to be seated for a long time while there were 3 empty tables next to us just no hostess and then the super loud waitress woke my sleeping baby cuz she was basically yelling the confirmation of our order.. and I'm still waiting for my cappuccino which I ordered 30min ago and although I already received my breakfast there is no sign of my coffee 😣 do not recommend!
Mymy,Love their egg benedict!
Mymy,"Typical wait for a favorite dining spot.  The egg dishes looked great and did not disappoint.  Highly recommend, in fact my son and I went back the next day."
Mymy,"If you like diner-style breakfasts, this place does them really well.  Friendly staff and tight seating.  The queue was 15 people long when we left (Sun AM)"
Mymy,One of the best meals/brunchesI’ve had in San Francisco.  Great coffee as well.  They have outdoor seating.
Mymy,"Jerry, we’re so happy to hear you had a good experience. Hope you have an amazing day!"
Mymy,The scrambles here are so tasty! Staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I have a gluten allergy and always feel safe and satisfied eating here.
Mymy,Zucchini ricotta cheese pancakes and tex-mex were our favourite! Best to visit on weekdays (no wait) .. weekend wait could be 30-45min since they don't take reservations and it's a small restaurant.
Mymy,"After reading so many awesome reviews of MyMy, I was actually scared to try it. There are way too many places in SF that haven't lived up to my expectations and I was quickly feeling that this would be one of them.  I came in around 9am on a Monday with my parents and the place was almost empty. We were seated immediately and asked for our drinks orders. I got an iced Americano, Mom got a latte, and Dad got grapefruit juice. By the time the drinks arrived, the place was full! We got in at exactly the right time.  The menu had more than enough choices for us, and every single one sounded better than the last. I had a really difficult time choosing, but I went with the Tex Mex Scramble, Mom had the Zucchini Pancakes, and Dad had the Mambo Italiano Scramble.  Tex Mex Scramble: 4-stars. I ordered it without tortillas and without toast, and even so, this dish was HUMONGOUS. An incredibly fluffy scramble full of meaty and spicy chorizo, creamy avocado, melted gooey pepper jack cheese, slightly crunchy bell peppers and onions, topped with pico de gallo and chipotle mayo. While I'm normally a huge fan of chipotle anything and spicy mayo anything, I actually think this scramble didn't need it, and might have been better without it. It was overpowering of the other flavors, which were all fantastic and perfectly balanced. I was shocked at how fluffy the eggs were, even with all the other ingredients! The chorizo was a bit greasy, which is probably my only complaint for this dish. The hash browns were super thin, almost more like a hash brown crepe, and crisped to perfection. I did get a coconut flavor from them, so I wonder if they were fried in coconut oil? I love coconut so this didn't bother me, but it was a bit unexpected.  Zucchini Pancakes: 5-stars. Two large, ridiculously fluffy ricotta pancakes with zucchini inside and a light parmesan crust. The pancakes were almost buttery while the zucchini provided a bit of fibrous texture and the parmesan brought out a richness to the entire bite. No syrup was needed, or wanted, to enjoy these delights. The two eggs served sunny side up broke perfectly and added rich yolky goodness to the pancakes, making this a perfect meal for those who love eggs but also like carbs!  Mambo Italiano Scramble: 5-stars. The rounder, more rustic version of my Tex Mex scramble. Earthier flavors from the garlic, pine nuts, and mushrooms balanced with some acidity from the tomatoes and smoky creaminess from the mozzarella. While the two scrambles were equally good in my mind, the lack of grease on this one gets it the higher star rating.  The service here was good, attentive but not overbearing. Overall, my experience was fantastic and I look forward to returning!"
Mymy,"Beautiful little breakfast shop. They serve exquisite gourmet breakfast, over some soothing bossa nova music, and the gentle clash of plates and glasses back in the open kitchen. overall a very pleasant morning! Ironically I'd avoid the coffee (bland and burnt) otherwise perfect!"
Mymy,Super fast and friendly service. Tasty food.
Mymy,"Tim, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much. Thank you for your very kind words and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Very crowded and there's usually a wait late morning. Pretty small space and not the best atmosphere to have a relaxing meal. The food is admirably good though. Not cheap but totally worth it.
Mymy,I went for brunch for my trip to San Francisco this past weekend and the food here was amazing. I couldn't get enough of the fried potatoes. everyone that was with me really enjoyed their food and will be coming back to this place when i'm back in town.
Mymy,"As far as lunch options go, our sandwich and burger were as good as what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. Friendly service, and I'm sure brunch is better but definitely not coming back for lunch."
Mymy,"Best breakfast/brunch place in the city. The wait is usually longer on Saturday or Sunday morning. But it's worth waiting for even an hour (which is rarely a case). Must try: Blueberry Banana Pancake, Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and OJ, which is freshly squeezed."
Mymy,"Excellent scrambles, amongst best I've had! Get ready for the long lines if you're coming with friends.   On Saturday at noon, groups of 2 were getting seated in 15' or so, but there were 4 of us and had to wait for about an hour."
Mymy,"Delicious eggs benedicts! The food was great, the portion was huge and service was fast. Apparently lineups are long on the weekend, so try going on a weekday if you can."
Mymy,Not much to eat there if you're vegan
Mymy,"Hi Dafna, thank you for your visit and feedback. We serve many vegans, and next time you are in, be sure to ask your server what we can do for you. We hope to see you back soon. "
Mymy,Great little hidden gem.. good prices.  Loved my grilled chicken sandwich.  Husband loved his omelet.  Red velvet coffee is to die for.  Loved this place!!
Mymy,Salmon is awesome
Mymy,Hi Y. We are happy to see you enjoy our salmon so much. Thank you! We look forward to serving you again in the near future. 
Mymy,How can I even put into words how amazing this place is! The food is on another level and the people who work there are even better! I have the pleasure of eating there when I visit SF a few times a year. It is a MUST on my list on places to eat.
Mymy,The food portions were sizable and the food was really good ! It was high quality and tastes really well. Highly recommend it. It's really busy even on weekdays so be ready to lineup.
Mymy,"A cute little eatery with a slightly upscale diner-like vibe. The food is good and even slightly creative, though the ingredients could stand to be a little higher quality to get that fifth star. The service is also very good."
Mymy,"We were celebrating a friend's birthday as a little surprise. The server and the ""manager"" refused that by saying ""outside food"" isn't allowed. I asked if they had cake - any cake - that we could buy inside for our friend since we waited in line for 45 minutes to get a table. The supposed ""manager"" - while being unbelievably and unreasonably rude - said That I can't get into the restaurant with a cake in my hand even if I don't open it to celebrate the birthday.  She snatched the menus off of the table and refused us service... this is when I lost it. Absolutely inconsiderate and careless to costumers."
Mymy,"Must stop for breakfast! Delicious, delicious, dee-licious!!"
Mymy,"Delicious breakfast food served quickly (although the lines can be long).  Scrambled egg dishes are the best, serve with very crunchy potatoes. Don't forget the orange juice."
Mymy,Not bad but not great either...it was very promising based on the menu Had the crab cakes Benedict and the ricotta pancakes It was greasy and the side was cold The pancakes were very disappointing... They added (without mentioning in the menu) some soft meringue inside which doesn't add anything.
Mymy,The best breakfast in San Francisco! They do something amazing to their potatoes… voodoo potatoes. I eat here every time I visit the City.
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Toby. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Its super hot we could not breath! Bees all over the food and drinks. bad service . OUTDOOR NO GOOD! Californina bendickct WAS YUCK!! Line waiting was almost 4 hrs! Very bad options ! Wish I never went there! DONT RECCOMEND IT AT ALL DONT GO
Mymy,"One of our favorite breakfast spots. The service is amazing, and all the food is super fresh and tasty. There is a line most of the time, so be prepared."
Mymy,"Favorite brunch spot at the moment.  1) An extensive menu with plenty of both savory and sweet choices. 2) An awesome fruit bowl (aka not a melon bowl) can be substituted for hash browns 3) But the has browns are awesome themselves. McD's style, thin and crispay."
Mymy,"Super fast service and really delicious food. Wish I could try everything on their menu, but specially recommend the Benedicts. The line is super long by like 10 am on weekends, but if you go around 9 am the wait is Iike 5 min."
Mymy,"YUMYUM! The hollandaise here is really great! The Yukon potatoes are amazing too. Service can be a bit slow when they get busy, but they get busy for a reason. Yum."
Mymy,"The corn beef hash, with onions, over medium eggs and an aoli dressing, along with the crispest Yukon gold potatoes, is probably the one of best breakfasts I’ve experienced in 10 years in the U.S."
Mymy,Amazing breakfast and service 😋 …
Mymy,Thank you Denise. It's nice to see you enjoyed your meal and we greatly appreciate your visit and review. Hopefully you'll be back soon!
Mymy,"One of my favorites in the city. The plate sizes are nice for sharing, entries are fairly priced. Sides are overpriced by on average ~$2; skit the sides and save a lot of money."
Mymy,Yummy lemon pancakes but left a little to be desired in my opinion.  Fresh strawberries were tasty but it was the pistachio latte that stole my heart!! Idk how they made it but it was magical!!!
Mymy,"Food is good, but outside seating is a bit uncomfortable, servers are friendly but few so it's hard for them to be attending too many tables at the same time and your food will take long, like 45 minutes long."
Mymy,I had a great time at mymy having brunch with my family.  I accidentally but dialed a 1 star review and have returned to correct it to 5 stars!
Mymy,"We appreciate your visit Michael. Thank you. If there is any feedback you'd like to provide or if something wasn't exactly as you had hoped, please let us know so we can look into it and make sure your next visit is 100% 5-stars! We look forward to serving you again soon."
Mymy,"Lots of outdoor seating, good service, great place for brunch"
Mymy,Hi Ravi. Thank you so much for this kind review. We look forward to having you visit us again!
Mymy,"This place is lovely! Had the Parma Benediction, light, beautiful, perfectly created, the right amounts, it was absolutely delicious. Would recommend Mimosas as well, nice ratio juice and champagne... ;)"
Mymy,"Excellent food and great service! There was a line out the door, but we were not rushed and our food was tasty."
Mymy,"Hi Allyson, thank you for your 5-star rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your visit and we hope to see you back again some day in the near future!"
Mymy,"Great place, awesome service and a very diverse menu. Was not too impressed with my dish (some jalapeños / chorizo thing), but my colleagues really liked theirs. Would definitely recommend Mymy for breakfast!"
Mymy,This is a great breakfast restaurant without all the fuss of some of the bigger-named venues in San Francisco. The lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for! The service is also great and fast!
Mymy,Been coming to this place for years and it is the model of consistency.  Every dish is the same high quality every time.  There's a bit of a line on weekend mornings but it moves quickly and is absolutely worth it.
Mymy,"Fantastic!  Crab cake benedict was super delicious.  Mimosa was a little pricey, but it was great.  Potatoes were perfectly crisp."
Mymy,"Exceptional! Had the Frisco omelet, hash browns and toast. Fresh avocado is on top, coffee was deliciously full bodied. Raspberry preserves you can spoon out from a dish. :-)"
Mymy,"Breakfast was delish, had the chilaquiles. My friend had the lemon cottage cheese pancakes.  Would come here again."
Mymy,"Mel, we're glad you came in! We're happy to see you found the breakfast to be delicious, thank you for the compliments and we look forward to serving you again someday soon!"
Mymy,I love this place you come at the right time and there's no wait. Red velvet latte is delishious. Who knew you could mix lobster and scrambled eggs.
Mymy,"If you want one of the mimosas they advertise, bring your ID if you're nearly 50. You also can't get a BLT until 11 am. But you can order a side bacon, side of toast, side of tomato and make your own"
Mymy,The best authentic Diner in SFO.
Mymy,Great breakfast and brunch place. Creative dishes great service and a fun artsy atmosphere. I would come back. I got the pork scramble with salsa verde and it was great.
Mymy,Great food and quick service!
Mymy,Thank you Sneha! It's great to hear that you enjoyed your visit and we hope to see you again soon!
Mymy,"Wait time for the food and getting in can be frustrating, but the food makes up for it. Had the crab cakes, man they were amazing to say the least!"
Mymy,Thank you Dhiraj.  It's nice to see you enjoyed your meal and we greatly appreciate your visit. Hopefully you'll be back soon!
Mymy,One of the best breakfast in San Francisco Very good choice of meals and diversified Eggs Benedict are good as if the French toasts or the lemon pancake 🥞 …
Mymy,Best breakfast food ever! Everything was fresh and the mimosas was the sugar on top!! I will definitely be back soon.
Mymy,An extra dollar in price is well worth the special care given to standard dishes. i.e. 3 pieces of thick bacon vs. 2 for a side of bacon (priced at $3.50)
Mymy,"Great service! I loved the crab cake Benedict. While there's always a wait on the weekends, I've never had to wait during the week"
Mymy,The official breakfast spot of Site E graveyard shift!! The Challah bread french toast is just 🔥🔥🔥....I need to learn the secret of how they do their potatoes before I need a support group....and that mango Mimosa is alla dat....just let us toss in a double shot of silver tequila every now and then and you will have the universe on lock!!!!
Mymy,Before going to Mymy I had never had a poached egg. They slapped two on some corned beef and house potatoes and it was among the best breakfasts I’ve ever had Also the food came crazy fast and everyone was amazingly kind
Mymy,Good food - big servings! Lots of options for egg lovers. Friendly staff but they're super quick so rem to catch them inbetween clients.
Mymy,Came here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning with a group of 7 people. We were seated when we got there and the food was good - potatoes were really crispy and the scramble was great.
Mymy,Great food good portions.. im a picky chicano from southern California so I was skeptical but they exceeded my expectations...its city prices but worth it.
Mymy,"Get in line early, it's worth it!"
Mymy,"Juls, thank you for your visit and very kind five-star review. We hope you'll be back with us again for another meal very soon."
Mymy,Bloody Mary and Baja Benedict - simply sublime!
Mymy,"I don't believe I've ever written a review about eggs, but their Duck Scramble and Lorraine Omelette are worth the effort. Throw in a Soju Bloody Mary, and you'll have  a grand time!"
Mymy,Delicious food that was well worth the wait.
Mymy,Great classic brunch spot with mimosas of different flavors and a menu for many
Mymy,"Elijah, thanks for taking time out of your day to review us. Hope to see you again in the near future!"
Mymy,"Amazing food, great service. Got there early enough to not have to wait on line. A small place but plenty to offer"
Mymy,Have been coming here for years. Consistently great service and delicious food
Mymy,"Hi Caroline. Thank you for your visit and very nice review. We are happy to hear you enjoy our food so much. Next time you come back, be sure you introduce yourself so we can thank you in person! We look forward to serving you again in the near future."
Mymy,"Great breakfast spot! Delicious food, OK pricing, no so good service."
Mymy,"Skylayr, thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal, but are sorry if you felt like the service could've been better. Usually people enjoy our friendly service, so we will certainly look into what may have happened and see to it that your next visit is perfect in every way. We hope to see you again soon!"
Mymy,The eggs had an odd articial taste to them. The bacon was just ok and they didn't even offer any gluten-free toast. Not going back again.
Mymy,Delicious benedict and scramble. Coffee and food still hot after picking it up for takeout. Easy online ordering system. Will certainly return!
Mymy,Without a doubt one of the best breakfast's I've ever had. Our Uber driver steered us away from Mama's for this gem. No regrets. Hit it up!
Mymy,"Nice breakfast near nob Hill. Quick service, large portions attractively presented. Great coffee. Try the tartine with jalepeno and chorizo."
Mymy,The quality of the food was incredible.
Mymy,"That's very kind of you to say, Manuel. Thank you for your visit and wonderful review! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal, and we hope to see you back again someday in the near future!"
Mymy,Awesome breakfast. Small but super clean. Service was 5 star
Mymy,"We appreciate the review, Dennis. Thanks for taking the time. Hope to see you again in the near future!"
Mymy,"Waiting in line is WORTH IT. Atmosphere is amazing: cozy, productive, & lots of chatter. Small, lively place with really great food.  P.S. try the soufflé pancakes"
Mymy,Great place for a family breakfast
Mymy,"That's so kind of you to say, Alfredo. We're thrilled to know you enjoy having a family meal with us and hope to serve you again soon. Thank you!"
Mymy,"People always line up for Olea's, however, in my humble opinion, I believe, My My trumps Olea.  MyMy's swedish pancake, regular pancakes, french toast and waffles are all delicious.  The line is shorter, the price is lesser.  What more could one ask on a lazy Sunday afternoon when you finally rolled out of bed and just want some great brunch fare?"
Mymy,Delicious food and great portion size. The service is super friendly!
Mymy,Hi Katsiaryna.Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal and we hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
Mymy,"O.....M......G! THIS RESTAURANT IS FANTASTIC! I wish this was a local place in my city! The food is to die for! I would go again and Again and Again!  There is a little bit of a wait, BUT it's worth it! 😍 …"
Mymy,Great food. Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had
Mymy,Hi Jason. Thank you for your visit and generous rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed our food and we hope to serve you again someday!
Mymy,My favorite breakfast spot in Nob Hill. They make really good Eggs Benedict. Staff are friendly. Expect to wait during lunch break.
Mymy,"Food is delicious.  They also made 2 fabulous latte, pistachio and red velvet. Service is also excellent."
Mymy,Awesome food.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
Mymy,"Happy to hear that you our food, Clau. See you again soon!"
Mymy,Highly recommend the crab cakes benedict!
Mymy,"Hi Soumoditya, thank you so much for the kind review. We hope you will visit us again some day!"
Mymy,Great breakfast... corned beef hash was awesome with side of Bacon.  Fresh O. J. Service was fast and polite... Highly recommended!
Mymy,this place is over rated.  Plus they put sugar in their fresh squeezed oj. I saw the girl do it while I was sitting at the counter people watching while I was waiting for my food LOL. It was some sort of light brown liquid.  Not only is there a long wait to get in... there is a long wait for the food.
Mymy,"I ordered the Norwegian Benedict with a side of crispy potatoes and orange juice. They were delicious, refreshing and filling."
Mymy,Very nice meal today
Mymy,"Fes, we’re so happy to hear you had a nice meal. We will share this with the team!"
Mymy,"Fast friendly service, the pancakes wete the bomb. Thr coffee hot and strong the OJ fresh and cold. If I lived in the city this would me my go to breakfast."
Mymy,"Not what you would call intimate or personal service, but the food was excellent and they handle the huge crowds gracefully. Seriously, worth it just for the potatoes. Happily go back anytime."
Mymy,"The food was good! I looked at the menu and was like this is not gone be to my liking. Boy was I surprised, those zucchini pancakes to die for!!!"
Mymy,AMAZING breakfast and service! They gave me exactly what I asked for and did not hold back with the servings. Will go again 100%.
Mymy,Great food! Zucchini pancakes were delicious! Kids didn't even suspect veggies in them
Mymy,The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly! I would highly recommend this restaurant to go for breakfast.
Mymy,"When the food is delicious, expect to wait. This restaurant fits into this category and will not disappoint in terms of food quality and flavors"
Mymy,Delicious breakfast dishes at a great price. Highly recommend the 6 hr corned beef hash and the smoked salmon tartonie.
Mymy,The best brunch place in the city... food quality is amazing. I've eaten here about 20 times. It's that good.
Mymy,Quick service & good breakfast selection.
Mymy,Try to get there early for brunch as there's always a long line out the front. The menu is a very eclectic mix of cuisine styles but all very tasty.
Mymy,They offer a fantastic selection of Eggs Benedict style dishes. Bloody Mary was good. Staff was friendly. Try the chicken sausage.
Mymy,"Loved this place, so close to apartments. Fast, quick, great presentation, delicious food,"
Mymy,"Hi M, that’s wonderful to hear. Thanks so much for leaving us a review. See you soon!"
Mymy,"I came here on Tuesday, March 3, 2015 and dutifully waited in line for the place to open.  The jackasses in charge then proceeded to wait until opening time to announce they couldn't open because of a ""technical"" problem.  They knew this earlier.  Why waste my time?  I heard a murmur in the crowd that this happened to someone before.  Nice.  Yeah, five stars here!"
Mymy,Delicious! Always good service and delicious food. The line moves MUCH faster than you think.
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Caitlin. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,Amazing food and even better service. Very good quality food and loved the portions. Highly recommend!!
Mymy,Really great brunch place. The Challa French toast was really wonderful. Be ready to wait for a bit if you are coming on the weekend.
Mymy,Love this breakfast place.
Mymy,"Hi Keira, thank you so much for the kind review. We hope you will visit us again some day!"
Mymy,"Less than stellar service that borders on rude. Mediocre brunch that is overrated and slightly over-priced. Overall, unimpressive as the same can be had elsewhere so much better."
Mymy,"Long waits, tasty brunch, but the lines are mitigated by contraband which is next door.  The price is also a little high for what you get, but the serving sizes are fairly large."
Mymy,"The food and coffee were wonderful! Great atmosphere, cozy and friendly. The staff is very friendly too! Cant go wrong here!"
Mymy,"The Frisco omelet is incredible! Great little place, with fun outdoor seating"
Mymy,"Thank you Scott. It's nice to see you enjoyed our Frisco Omelet, and atmosphere. We greatly appreciate your visit and review. Hopefully you'll be back soon!"
Mymy,Wonderful Breakfast! Great service and food.  Really enjoyed the potatoes and the fresh squeezed juice.
Mymy,The hype and the wait were worth it! Everything was amazing.
Mymy,"That's great to hear, Nicholas. Thank you so much for your very kind words and we're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
Mymy,I had breakfast.  The choices are amazing.  The food us first class. Truly looking forward to going back.
Mymy,Amazing food! The tex mex and Italian scramble were among the best I have ever had. Finally a breakfast place I can recommend!
Mymy,Great and large portion of breakfast. Their Cafe Cappuccino was very good.
Mymy,"Hi Russ, thank you so much for the kind review. We're glad you enjoyed our breakfast and Cappuccino and we hope you will visit us again some day!"
Mymy,"Holy hell the food. It's so good.  Yeah, just go."
Mymy,Oh my my! The best brunch ever! We visited SF from Austin and this place was recommended. Love it!
Mymy,"Hi Mary, glad to learn your experience was a positive one. Hope to see you again in the near future!"
Mymy,"There can be a long wait, but the food is excellent. Any of the pancakes are delicious, as is the peasant omelet (bacon, asparagus, and leeks)."
Mymy,"Food was great. Service was quick. I ordered, ate, paid and walked out the door with a smile on my face in thirty minutes."
Mymy,Nice coffee shop cafe. Good breakfast decent prices.
Mymy,The Big Papa burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and the meat had great flavor
Mymy,"Great tasting breakfast. The omelette I had was very large, so sharing may be a good idea for some people."
Mymy,Great service! The best pancakes and ube latte 🤤🤤🤤🥰
Mymy,Hello Jenny. Thank you for coming in! Glad to learn you enjoyed the Ube Latte and our service. See you soon!
Mymy,Tidy spot that we had breakfast. Service was excellent and the cornbeef hash was one of the best I have had. All of the food we had was delicious.
Mymy,I had a wonderful breakfast here. The staff is really friendly and the service is great.
Mymy,Excellent breakfast! The crispy potatoes were amazing. We will be going back soon!
Mymy,Very good french toast and benedict
Mymy,Delicious food. Very small place and long wait though. They try to kick you out as soon as you finish your food which is rude. Not sure if i want to go back to this place.
Mymy,Stumbled upon this spot with my dad and their fresh OJ was delicious! As was their egg/ bacon breakfast plate. Yum!
Mymy,"Quick service, the waitress was kind and polite. The Tex mex was delicious. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Mymy,"Great place for brunch! Seating is limited, ambience a little loud so you need to lean in to talk but overall a great place to come, especially after work!"
Mymy,Delicious! House made corned beef hashave (a personal favorite) was the best I've ever had. Phenomenal.
Mymy,This place gets a huge line gratefully my son and daughter-in-law new this and we beat it we got there early and I ordered the lemon pancakes? Whatever they were they or perfection
Mymy,"Food is good. Too heavy for me, but my hubby had a good time. The menu is unique."
Mymy,"One of my favorite brunch spots in San Francisco. The corned beef hash is a favorite, and the wait is always worth it!"
Mymy,"Good food and a great setting. May get busy a certain times like brunch, but the line moves quickly."
Mymy,"Everything its good, but expensive😉"
Mymy,"Claudia, we are pleased to see you enjoyed our food. Thank you. Please know our prices are based on using the highest-quality ingredients and paying our staff a livable wage. Even so, we are still competitive in cost with other top brunch spots in the Bay Area. We hope to see you again someday."
Mymy,"Good food, nothing exceptional, good service, long waiting lines, good service and delicious matcha latte."
Mymy,Hi Nazareth. Thank you for your visit and nice rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your latte and our service. We hope to serve you again someday in the near future!
