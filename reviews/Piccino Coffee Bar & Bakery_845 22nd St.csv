Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Food was good 😊, the service was a little busy somewhat grumpy/ impatient on that day we were there, but it's Sunday brunch so we tried to understand.  The atmosphere is amazing. I love the area and the restaurant itself.  The food was great, but may not be worth the price. It wasn't extraordinary or at least something more complex that I would say, no can't make that at home. Taste is exceptional, but maybe pricing OR serving size needs some check?"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Hi Hazel, thank you for your review/feedback. If it's not too much trouble, would you mind leaving this comment under the Piccino profile? This one is our coffee bar next door. Here's a direct link to the restaurants profile: https://g.page/piccinosf?share"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Really cute neighborhood spot! Some delicious pastries and my favorite flat white in neighborhood. I love the banana drop cookie and savory scone. Really appreciate vegan food options! Tried the matcha latte a few times and it was not great (super clumpy) so I will stick to their coffee!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Flat White with Oat Milk is strong and flavorful. Note that they only offer take outs and there is no indoor seating.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Thank you!!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"I got a Gibraltar/Cortado on Saturday and Sunday. Consistently well-made with low acidity, a lovely design, and friendly service. Quite busy on Sunday, more chill on Saturday. Earlier probably better. A bit pricier than most, but it’s hard to argue with the quality. If you want to be nature friendly, you can get your drink served in glass and enjoy it at the sunny park right next-door."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"We are so pleased you enjoyed your visits, and thank you for the high praise review, we truly appreciate it Shawn!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"I’ve been having coffees here for last 4 years and it’s been a great spot until today. It’s a new guy with long hair. He was very rude and impatient when I simply was trying to confirm my order. Not sure what triggered him but man, I was very disappointed."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Their Coffee Bar is quaint and I love seeing all the fur babies daily.  I enjoy having an Oat Latte here with a ginger scone or their Lemon Cake is equally fantastic. Highly Recommend having either baked goods or BOTH!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Such a pleasure reading this review, thank you so much Betty! See you again soon for that Oat Latte and that tasty treat! :)"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,I’m disappointed with the service of the baristas. I have seen them blatantly ignore my partner more than once as if they didn’t want his business. Their coffee is mediocre that it’s not worth returning for the bad service.  The only barista that provides a great experience is Sean.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"There's a reason why this place is a staple of the Dogpatch.  Great food, great service, great drinks.  Watching the kitchen staff work is like watching a well oiled machine run.  FOH staff were attentive and friendly."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Absolutely loved the Cortado the barista made for me. Tasted like real coffee than the stuff you get in fancy coffee chains. Costed $5 but worth it. There are stone benches outside where you can sit and enjoy the coffee. Try it!!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"We appreciate this review so much Geetika, thank you!!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Love Piccino!  Best brunch in SF.  Creative cocktails, fabulous food, and an attentive wait staff make this restaurant special.   I’ll definitely be back!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Upscale brunch spot with friendly service, attractive, comfortable interior, and slightly pricey, but very flavorsome and generous plates."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Thank you!!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Great latte, nice staff, cute neighborhood location. $9.75 after standard 20% tip for a latte seems like way too much, even by SF standards. Will likely stop by in the future if I’m in the neighborhood, but the price will keep me from going out of my way."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Thank you for your review and feedback Kyle! We serve Sightglass Coffee which is roasted right here in San Francisco, and on top of this receive a special roast from them that you can only get at the Piccino Coffee Bar. With that, of course carries a bit of a price to get hyper-local ingredients.. but you will find we are competitive with other coffee bars around the city!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Lovely place! Tasty coffee and pastry☕🥐
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Why thank you Jisoo! We really appreciate your great review. See you again soon!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,great coffee ☕️ spot. I love their flat white
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"quaint cafe with coffee, bakes and beans. the apple brioche was tasty!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"A reliable spot for an evening espresso. Their pour-overs and cold brew are great, and the tea selection isn't bad either. Plus great pastries and cookies—what more could you ask of a coffee shop?  More than one table? WiFi? Ok, that's fair. But Piccino's pretty great for what it is."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,The banana muffin is soooo good! And the matcha too😊
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Very cute coffee shop that has great coffee. They were extremely busy which goes to show how good their coffee is. I ordered a vanilla latte which had a nice design on top. Wait wasn’t very long despite how many people were there
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Thank you so much for this review, we really appreciate it!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Cozy spot to enjoy coffee. Next door is the restaurant which is also a great place to visit.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Fantastic little coffee shop and bakery attached to Piccino Restaurant. Their espresso drinks are some of the best in the city, and they have excellent non-coffee options too (I love their not-very-sweet hot chocolate). My favorite baked goods here are the ginger scones and banana muffins.  Edit: we got Piccino's apple crostada for Thanksgiving this year instead of making our own pie. It was absolutely delicious. It has a great balance of apple and citrus/cranberry flavors, and the crust is amazing. We would happily get it again!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Thank you so much Clarissa! We truly appreciate you kind words and excellent review. Hope to see you again in the not so distant future! :)
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"They don't know what espresso is. I dared to ask the girl at the desk if she could hand out the espresso that was ready, because I would cool off otherwise. She rolled her eyes saying oh my goodness. Don't serve what you don't appreciate. Took her 2 secs to do it. Skip the place. Terrible service. Unsurprisingly since I was already annoyed, the espresso wasn't worth the ten minutes I had to wait. They have a good espresso day over a lot of bad ones"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"We are really sorry you had this experience Frederic, hopefully we'll get it right for you next time around. Your feedback is duly noted!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Let’s recap: - Amazing coffee - Fast and kind service - Good location and surroundings - Top pastries too  Highly recommended. It’s been our go-to for a while now, we literally have Piccino as a walk destination in itself. Thanks for all the great coffee."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,ooh shucks! you just made us blush. Thank you!!
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,One of the best coffee I've ever had.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,😍😍
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,The staff is so rude it honestly left such a bad impression. I walked in excited to see the establishment during a getaway and it left me wondering “Wtf is going on” with these two women.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"We are truly sorry you had this experience Marie. I hope you might give us another chance at some point, but in the meantime thank you for your feedback, it is duly noted."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"For a tiny walk in cafe, they sure have a great selection of incredibly tasty baked goods to go with their coffee. Especially good are the ""fig newton"" which eats more like a compote filled soft sugar cookie, & their salted chocolate chip cookie which manages to be sweet and savory all at once. Only a few benches to sit on but your not here for the seating anyway!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Great neighborhood spot with fantastic coffee and treats. Located in a tiny space, plan on taking your stuff Togo. Facing out to the street there might be a couple small tables inside and on the sidewalk but I have always grabbed and gone."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Delicious 🤤 Gibraltar Best in SF ❤️
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Such kind words! Thank you for your excellent review, hope to see you again real soon!"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Piccino is a very friendly, authentic and welcoming coffee shop for coffee lovers of all types. The staff is great. The vibe is cool. And most importantly, the coffee tastes amazing."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,Seems to be hit or miss. Having gone a few times sometimes the drinks are exactly what I would expect other times it's lacking. The pastries however have never disappointed.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Thank you Joe, we appreciate your honesty and hope we can deliver a more consistent experience for you in the future."
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"I typically love piccino. During covid, I appreciate the spacing between the tables and safety measures. Service is great. The -1 star is because I found the food underwhelming"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,We think you should come try us again!! but so appreciate the feedback we are always trying to do better.
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Lovely hot chocolate, not like the overly sweet stuff you get from most coffee shops"
Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Thank you Min, so glad you liked it! We really appreciate this review and hope to see you soon for another hot chocolate now that the seasons are beginning to change! :)"

Piccino Coffee Bar & Bakery,"Thank you Sundar, so glad you like our coffee. We source our beans from Sightglass coffee roasters here in San Francisco, they actually make a special roast just for us here at the Piccino Coffee Bar! The good stuff carries a price of course, but you will find our prices are competitive with other local coffee bars here in SF :)"
