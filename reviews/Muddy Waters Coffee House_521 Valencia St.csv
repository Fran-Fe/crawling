Muddy Waters Coffee House,"They don't take cash, but there is an ATM which dispenses 20's, so you end up with some cash you didn't want. The ATM charged me 2.50 twice for ""checking my balance"" and then 2.99 to give me a twenty -- so 8 bucks went down the ATM fee  toilet so I could buy a coffee. It is customary to pay a tip too, so ten dollars in addition to the cost of the coffee.  The coffee is good enough and the atmosphere is nice, but why do I have to get ripped off by an ATM so they can misrepresent their taxable income, or whatever reason they have for only taking cash? It's no wonder two of their three locations are gone. I know for sure that I won't ever go back."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,So happy I went here. Just simply good coffee done simple. No overcharging for the same bean water and bagel that’s delicious but definitely not worth the price some of these places charge. Friendly and quick. Feels like a neighborhood stop.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Best Mocha ever! The chocolate is not too sweet, it is perfect . perfect. I order the regular Mocha, Hot. It is a Normal size cup. Just delicious tasting. Just the best  quality tasting chocolate, simple, not too thick  not too thin. I just need to express-O how delicious this Mocha is and It keeps me going and going even if I don't eat breakfast. I never have to add a extra shot, tho I might try it once. I wish  I could get a Mocha there every day, but I don't live nearby. I like it better than:starbucks,philz,peets,Chocolate, craftsman and wolves, etc. I tried two places about two blocks away toward higher numbered streets and they give you tiny cups or the chocolate and coffee are a little weird but ya drank it cuz you're in a hurry and staff are always nice and fun. But now I have muddy waters mocha. Plus it has been around since when I lived in the City eons ago."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"More than 23 years I've been a patron of Muddy Waters and every time I visit SF, I make sure to come and grab coffee for here and for home. The coffee is delicious, the service is delightful and she was so kind. It's old, battered, and comfortable like a favorite couch. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"I love this place. No frills, has a nice community feel and has been in the neighborhood for a really long time! Plenty of space, sockets and WiFi if you want to do work, also a nice place to read a book!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Great coffee at Muddy waters, and it’s terribly sad that they are having to close in February 2021, after being around for 27 years! There is another location on 16th and Valencia, and I definitely plan on supporting Hisham (the super nice owner) there."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,A simple place with good coffee.  I enjoyed listening to the Blues music the most. I will stop in again when I'm in the area.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Highly recommend stopping in. The coffee will not disappoint, and neither will the staff. Enjoy!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Long-standing coffee shop with no frills and no pretentiousness. “Where poets and painters and psychedelic aviators congregate.” Rad.  Great coffee, mellow vibe for working or chilling, good cafe menu.  Ignore criticism from mouth-breathers like Lady S (the one holding the rifle in her profile photo, gripping it as she desperately tries to ascribe that hunk of metal to her identity) or the other gal that failed to notice the 3+ signs explaining the cash only policy and decided that complaining on the internet was the right response."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Sick beats filled my earlobes the second I farted in the door. I don't know if it's my chronic IBS or the coffee, but I had diarrhea after drinking several cups on an empty stomach.  The taste in mouth was phenomenal. I will be going back again just for the good tastes and sick beats."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Laid back cafe with lots of charging stations.  The lady @ the counter was really nice ... & she recommended some great places nearby to visit.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Muddy Waters is a café that puts a capital “C” in coffee. 10/10
Muddy Waters Coffee House,$4 for a large coffee. Place is grimy. Ambiance sucks.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Love this place! A SF institution and a must stop for a cup of coffee.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,The coffee was okay. I ordered a double short mocha and got the medium size that I did not ask for. And they don't have their seven-layer bar like they used to. So not the same as I'm used to getting. Not a bad place but just doesn't stand out like it used to.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"I've been coming here for coffee for years. The coffee is excellent and so are the bagels and pastries from which to choose. The owner is a wonderful, warm-hearted woman who serves you. Her prices are cheaper than most cafes in the area."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Calm atmosphere. Great place to meet up with someone, or as well as going by yourself. Staff is friendly, attentive, and very helpful. They definitely have peak times, such as morning rush hour & can be chaotic. Overall definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a coffee lover!! Even if your not. Plenty of other choices.."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Some of these reviews are about the muddies up by 24th that burnt down and is closed this one is by 16th and is fine. It's just an old school coffee shop it's been here for years long before all the other coffee joints around here.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Great little gem in the mission. Still has the same quirky atmosphere of those locally owned spots we all love about San Francisco  but that continue to slowly disappear. Great coffee, bagels and pastries. The owner makes her own hummus which I highly recommend served on any one of the fresh bagels. Speaking of owners, she can be found working the counter most days serving with a smile and some fun sassy attitude if you want!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"This place is a gem and I hope they stay in the neighborhood forever. The people that work here are real, there are usually tables to work at & the wifi is nice. They have excellent taste in music and remind me of all the beautiful coffeehouses with artistic baristas that used to exist in oakalnd and the mission. While the back can be a little dark it’s an optimal space for creation."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Spacious location with plenty of tables to work. I love the bohemian feel of the place. Location is perfect - right in the middle of the action in the Mission. Coffee here is hit or miss... definitely get some burnt tasting roasts from time to time.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"We enjoyed the coffee. Recommend this quaint place. Also, the person in charge is human. She allowed us to use the restroom. Many places in SF don't in my experiences despite one's recent purchase at their respective establishments. This is the part of SF I detest when one is taking in the local fares. I will go back to Muddy Waters! Thanks person in charge! You're a gem!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Claims to have a bathroom, appears to be perpetually out of order."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Friendly service, good selection of old-style, unhealthy but tasty baked goods. Great coffee without any of the hipster-cold-drip-almond-milk-only purist BullS.. & it's open early for those who have to get to work before 9!! Hope this place doesn't get replaced by yet another unfriendly, 'good-looking' funked-up roaster."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"An idiosyncratic, conveniently located coffee shop. I didn't like the decor very much but it's a matter of taste. Unfortunately, they have no food but bagels or pastries - not good for lunch, unless you are a bagel person. Though it's inexpensive. Note that the coffee house is cash-only. They have a plenty of power outlets but only will let you use the wifi for three hours. If you want to work, also check the semi-hidden back section of the place."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"I don't really understand the concept of MW. The shop is big but quite dark, definitely not the standard SF artsy coffee spots. Besides that, coffee is good and people seem to feel comfortable about chilling / working / reading there.  You should go if you want to stay away from the more traditional SF techie crowd."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Delicious coffee and very friendly service!
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Good: The atmosphere is pretty mellow and there's a lot of seating.  Bad:  The drip coffee is mediocre.  I've tried it several times and it's always so-so.  Afraid to say that McDonald's coffee may be better compared to here.  Final:  Swing by here after a local meal to wind down, but don't be expecting great coffee."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"I love the main barista, the mocha's are on point, she makes my bagels perfect, & they have good pastries. It's also a great atmosphere for studying, working, or just unwinding."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"No frills? Lol. They give you a smaller coffee serving while charging more than Starbucks. Five bucks for a ""medium"" cappuccino which had 80% foam and two sips of the actual coffee. On request to splash some brew to at least finish the cookie purchased here too, was offered to pay for another cup. Such a rip off"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Just drink a cup of coffee with my friend joaquin
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Stanza has a lot better coffee. This place is a little cooler temperature wise and less pretentious than Four Barrel. They also kicked me out for having an iced mocha from dandelion, I've been there a few times but I won't be returning."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Excellent coffee shop where you can get some work done.  The coffee bread rocks!  So does the banana bread!  The wifi is a bit slow, but it is most other places I've been in town as well.  The folks who work here are very friendly and helpful!  Last update 6/5/2015  Reason for being here: Waiting for the traffic on the L train to die down."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Muddy Waters is a classic of the mission district: wood floors and a cosy feel, but sort of run down since it's been there for years.  The people watching here is hilarious, usually you will see some very strange interactions between mission characters.  Overall the coffee is not the best, but they have snacks, are open late and a restroom for customers that is decently clean for the mission."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"A little dicey but a perfect example of the Mission before gentrification really went bezerk. Decent coffee and espresso beverages and cookies, pastries and snacks. Good free WiFi for 3 hours with a purchase"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"The service and coffee was top notch!  Not sure how to spell her name but Nadjet went out of her way to assist me while I was waiting for a friend arriving in from the airport.  I wanted to go next door and grab a taco for my friend so he would have something to eat when he arrived and Nadjet offered to put my suitcase behind the counter while I ran next door.  We also exchanged some life stories, this is what coffee shops are supposed to be!  My friend finally arrived and she treated him equally as well.  Loved it!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Decent, genuine place with a local vibe. My go-to spot. Coffee is not the greatest, but at least you are not going to look like a douche like in other places around where the regular conversation topic usually involve ""how rich I am""."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Nofrills coffee shop, felt a little overpriced though. There are plenty of small tables, so you can work away quietly on your laptop. Parking is very difficult nearby but very well connected to transit."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,I came here to use the bathroom and the lady at the front was very kind. I bought an Americano and she wanted to make sure I wasn't buying it because I wanted to pee. She was so kind! I bought the Americano and it was fresh and tasty. Great service from a down to earth business owner.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"This isn't some shiny, white-walled coffee shop. Muddy Waters is a staple of the mission, and been around as long as I've lived here. If you're kind to the staff (and you should be), they'll be kind back. Plenty of seating, free wifi, and a menu of food along with coffee and tea selections. It's cash only, but there's an ATM inside. If you're going to sit inside on a laptop, make sure you tip accordingly ;)"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Muddy Waters is pretty much my go-to coffee house in the Mission... it's the place I suggest to meet up with friends or (my last visit) clients. Great atmosphere and vegan options for snacks.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Great place to get some work done - getting five starts because it was cash only and I was a few cents short and the cashier was really nice about it. Super college coffee shop vibe.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Around 9:00pm I have a coffee in this place, bad customer service and racism. I ordered a coffee with cream and he gave me a coffee without cream. Mr. said that I would milk the coffee. I asked for a code for the wifi and he gave me one that did not work. Negroes are definitely not welcome in this place"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Fun, funky, unpretentious coffee shop that reminds me of the old days in SF. One wall is covered floor to ceiling with flyers touting the traditional coffee shop memes of local theatrical and music performances, writing classes, music lessons, and household services."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"One of the last unpretentious coffee houses in the Mission. No pour-overs, no waiting for 20 mins. Almost the last coffee house in the Mission where you can actually get a latte. Enjoy freedom from $9 pour-overs!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,I asked for a receipt but I was not given one. I hope that IRS closes down this establishment.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Decent cold brew (a bit bitter) but great for the price esp in SF. Small collection of paperbacks you can read, and overall great place to catch your breath!"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,I came here because my cell phone was dying and I need some juice to catch my next Uber. Despite the name Muddy Waters the coffee house played smooth jazz. The jazz was nice while I sipped on my ice cold Sanpellegrino and recapped the day with my beautiful wife.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Great place to grab a coffee and muffin on Valencia Street and people watch (cash only)
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Good coffee, expertly made each time. great service. Super friendly staff. What more do you want from a coffee shop?"
Muddy Waters Coffee House,Free chocolate and marshmallow samples. Very delicious chocolate coffee. Reasonable prices. Cool environment with visibility into the creation of their products.
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Good service, horrible coffee. Two sips and dumped it in the trash around the corner. Burnt acid water. Barista was friendly and attentive, but the product made it a waste of time and money."

Muddy Waters Coffee House,"A coffee shop with blues in the background, plenty of space for small meetings between small groups. Food, computer friendly atmosphere, and artsy."

Muddy Waters Coffee House,"There are a lot of good places in this neighborhood, we were looking for a nice place to sit and drink morning coffee and eat something on the side. The cafe is in a really central place, spacious, and lots of locals. It has a really homely atmosphere. We decided to eat the bagel with an egg. The choice was successful, the bagel is fresh, hot and tasty, the egg is excellent. The coffee was also really good, lots of foam and medium strength. The owner of the place is a really nice woman, completely reasonable prices."
Muddy Waters Coffee House,They sell very good coffee
Muddy Waters Coffee House,"Good breakfast, friendly staff."
