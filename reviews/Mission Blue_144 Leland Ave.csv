Mission Blue,"An amazing local coffee shop with a diverse variety of assorted merchandise to purchase. Not really a place to chill inside but you feel so much at home with the welcoming staff. The moment you enter the shop, there is a warm welcoming effect with a sense of belonging. The selection is solid to choose for your delight and the drinks are on point. There might not be room indoors but there is a local garden with plenty of space and some tables and chairs outside for a quick gathering with a friend or two. Check this place out if you're local."
Mission Blue,On the road and want to get some coffee and find this. Cute local handmade art crafts shop that also selling coffee and pastry. Some special coffee favors that I would like to try next time.
Mission Blue,Thank you for coming in !! Appreciate your kind words! 
Mission Blue,"Your place is amazing and the first small business that has a compost for the customers. I was so happy to see that. It's unfortunate that the customers do not spare a minute to separate their trash.  I gave you a 4 star only because you all are still supporting single use waste. I understand the customers want take aways but this is where America as a society must change. People must learn to pause and sit down and have their beverages or meals. If they want a take away, people must bring their containers. I understand as a business it is hard to make money when customers do not want to make an effort. But putting a sign outside promoting bringing your own cup would help. People know single use waste is an issue but do not want to bring the discipline. The sign might be the spark in their mind. Hope you are able to help educate the customers! I will swing by again sometime when I am back in town. Best wishes to your business! Ciao!"
Mission Blue,"A real community hub.  Delicious coffees and pastries.  Local artists goods for sale.  Community spirit!  Get it to enjoy at tables outside or take it to go.  Enjoy, support, be part of community.  Family friendly."
Mission Blue,Very good & great customer service! I had an iced oatmilk lavender latte & their vegan blueberry muffin. Good stuff
Mission Blue,"I wanted to come to this place for a long time and I finally had the opportunity. The place is very nice filled with random things to buy. I love that most of the thing are local so this is a local business supporting other local small/business. The menu is is great and you can find different options for drinks and pastries. I had an iced lavender latte and it was delicious I also had a pastry but forgot the name of it. Everything was great from the service to the price and quality , I 100% recommend people to come here. For sure I will!!!!"
Mission Blue,"Their lavander latte is why I came here. A great treat to myself on a weekend morning. If you don't like sweet, make sure you ask them to make it less sweet. Street parking only."
Mission Blue,"There is something intimate and warm about this place, we loved having our breakfast here( jam and cheese croissants and our coffee) Charming"
Mission Blue,"Amazing lavender latte. Great coffee itself, not bitter and had great robustness but delicate at the same time. The lavender was not too strong either nor was it too sweet. My perfect type of treat coffee. The owners and service was so kind and genuine. They really made the experience lovely. Art and interior also peaked my interest with all the local works."
Mission Blue,"Wonderful, quaint little neighborhood coffee shop!  Coffee (mocha) is consistently good: hot and the right balance of bitterness and chocolate sweetness.  The staff are so warm, friendly and welcoming.  They have lots of coffee and tea options and also some yummy pastries.  Not only that, they care about the community, actively sponsoring and participating in neighborhood events and looking out for the well-being of the neighborhood and its residents.  We are so lucky to have them here!  One thing to note is that they don't have seating inside, only outside."
Mission Blue,Really super cute place with a great atmosphere. Lots of boutique items to look at while you wait for your coffee. Using St Frank's coffee which is a winter always.
Mission Blue,Thank you for the very kind review! Hope you can come back soon!
Mission Blue,Such a cozy and lovely coffee shop. My lavender late was delicious! Didn’t expect to see local artists work for sale. There’s only outdoor sitting.
Mission Blue,Thank you so much for coming in! So happy you enjoyed your lavender latte❤️
Mission Blue,This is the best little hidden cafe with the best staff! The selection of local artists works and really great coffee makes for the amazing cafe that Mission Blue is! Kellie is the best and we will continue to go to Mission Blue!
Mission Blue,Super good coffee and tea and very welcoming staff. I try to come every Friday and weekend and they always make an effort to remember my order. Really makes me feel appreciated and welcomed. My puppy loves their cookies too!
Mission Blue,"St. Frank's coffee served in a very community oriented coffee shop. The coffee is great (especially the lavender latte!) and they also sell products made by local artists, like Erin Hupp's beautiful ceramics (the ceramic mugs are great for coffee!). The owner is really kind and friendly as well and hosts community events like pop ups across the street. Will definitely come back for more!"
Mission Blue,"We got recommended an iced caramel latte with whipped cream and caramel drizzle and it was one of the best coffees I ever tried! We came to SF for a quick 3 day trip and 2 out of those 3 days we had to come back, the service was 10/10 as well as the food!"
Mission Blue,"This place rocks.  Great service, friendly customers, delicious drinks and treats, seats in the sunshine.  What more could you ask for?  I got the spiced pear tea latte and the mochi muffin which were both delicious, and I will definitely be coming back soon!"
Mission Blue,Adorable local coffee shop serving legit coffee.  My husband had a flat white and I had a cappuccino - both were excellent with well balanced espresso flavor and super smooth velvety foam.  The owner Kelly is super sweet - she told us she trained with the St. Frank guy and it shows!  The shop also sells cute gifts from local artisans.
Mission Blue,So nice to have met you guys!  Thank you for your support.
Mission Blue,Love love love this little gem of a cafe and craft store.  Hit it while on the new Cross Town Trail.  Such nice people!
Mission Blue,"The best new coffee shop in town! Great customer service, a beautiful smooth latte, free WiFi, right next to the beautiful visitation valley gardens. Definitely worth a visit!"
Mission Blue,Sweet shop/cafe with amazing service and friendly staff and owner. The Coconut Ube Latte is delicious 💜
Mission Blue,I needed to get some work done on my car so came to order a drink and wait a bit. Ordered a matcha calamansi which was very tasty and appropriate for a hot summer day.  The folks here are really friendly and the shop is a little tight but very clean and organized.
Mission Blue,"Quaint lil coffee shop w/ local artist items for sale.  Even had an artist sewing custom hats and purses on sight today.  Talk about a win win for your local economy, and a way to get to know neighboring artist."
Mission Blue,"Wonderful, friendly and tasty experience. Mission Blue has great coffee and pastries. Also they have a large variety of locally produced arts and crafts on display for sale. Mission Blue has a refreshing feel. Check this place out!"
Mission Blue,"Thank you so much for coming in, Vincent! Appreciate your kind words!"
Mission Blue,"The best! Great coffee drinks, pastries and gift items by local artists."
Mission Blue,A truly special little coffee shop.  They make a mean cup of joe - using St Frank's beans - amazing amazing.  But even more - this enclave is home to a thoughtfully curated artisan products and art from residents of Visitacion Valley.  There is a beautiful energy in this store. Check it out.
Mission Blue,"Me and my son come here in the mornings on weekdays on our way to the park their drinks are excellent and pastries are delicious my son loves the cinnamon bun or the chocolate chip cookie, and I usually get an iced drink and ham and cheese croissant. Love this place it’s beautiful specially for buying small gifts for a loved one.❤️ Definitely recommend to anyone in the visitation valley area."
Mission Blue,Stumbled on this treasure of a coffee shop/gift shop yesterday while walking San Francisco's Crosstown Trail. What a win for this neighborhood! You can tell it is beloved by the community and I can see why. This is the type of business that anchors people to a neighborhood and offers space for true community to develop and thrive.
Mission Blue,"One of the only good coffee shops in the visitation valley neighborhood.  Nice display of local art, events, and products for sale.  Offers your typical coffee drinks and some with matcha.  Charming little spot."
Mission Blue,"I found Mission Blue when looking for a coffee shop close to my Airbnb. The beverages are top class and so are the pastries. The shop is very nicely curated showcasing local arts and crafts. The team around Kelly, Josh & George have such a rare sense of hospitality - they genuinely care, are positive and attentive. Highly recommend to visit this place!"
Mission Blue,"Michael, it’s been a pleasure to serve you during your stay in SF! Thank you so much for this kind review!"
Mission Blue,Best motor oil. I had in a long time. Gets me going. Thank u
Mission Blue,"Wow! Not only was the coffee amazing, but the service was top notch. It was my first time there and the owner made me feel right at home. I had the seasonal Cuban latte, and it was one of the best coffee drinks I've ever had. I high recommend Mission Blue!"
Mission Blue,Wonderful little neighborhood place with lovely local gifts items.  The lavender latte is delicious and love the added lavender flowers on top.
Mission Blue,Thank you for your very kind review! It was so nice to see you this morning !!
Mission Blue,"This is a must visit. New on Leland Ave. Clean, good good coffee and assorted drinks and pastries. They also display jewelry, candles, etc made by people from the community. Great place to sit, read and enjoy your day."
Mission Blue,"Try the lavender latte, you won't regret it! Everything in that store is of local make. It's such a fun shoppe to walk through and the owner is a doll! Great coffee. The ""Thai iced coffee"" is more inspired than it is direct (actually Thai iced coffee will give you a sugar coma) but it was still delicious. Come here for coffee if you can!"
Mission Blue,"Adorable coffee shop with crafts from local artists. Obviously a neighborhood gem. Owner was on site and very friendly. I was just visiting, but I can see how quickly this place could become a daily stop if I lived nearby. We'll be back when visiting the area."
Mission Blue,"Best muffin I’ve ever had, coffee was top notch and staff are super sweet! Notice there’s no muffin in my picture? I inhaled it!"

Mission Blue,"Cute new(ish) coffee shop in Vis Valley! This place is nestled right next to a beautiful stretch of greenways and features tons of art and work from local artists for purchase.  The horchata latte is perfect. If you’re in the mood for pastries, the everything croissant is amazing and the lemon poppyseed loaf is also a great choice.  On top of everything, the staff are so sweet; this place is definitely a must-go."

Mission Blue,"I have nothing but good things to share about Mission Blue. It’s been a blessing to have this gem on Leland Avenue. Out of my 26 years of living in this neighborhood, I have never hung out in the area as much as I do now that Mission Blue has existed. I love the owner and her family. Kellie is such a sweet soul and her heart is made of gold. Thanks so much for this “safe haven” as I call it."
