Pat's Cafe,"This was a cute quaint restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. We were able to get seated quickly and our server was very friendly. My hubby got the french toast but unfortunately he did not care for them only because he decided he is not a sourdough bread fan but I did taste them and they were decent, I do think the sourdough bread does give a slight different taste. I had the eggs and pancakes which were very good. The home fries/potatoes were cooked well but didn't have any seasoning and the bacon seemed to be tough and old, we did ask for fresh bacon and it was better. The hot chocolate was delish but the latte was decent. Overall, we enjoyed eating here and enjoyed our seat in the front window."
Pat's Cafe,Sounds like we were just okay.
Pat's Cafe,We went here for breakfast and the food was really good and the staff were very friendly. We were a party of 9 and they were able to accommodate us quickly. The prices were decent for the area and close to the Marriott Hotel. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a sit down breakfast place.
Pat's Cafe,So good we had it twice on our visit to SF. Smoked Salmon Benedict and crab cake Benedict were absolutely perfect. The service was excellent and it has a nice local vibe. Eat indoors or outside on the front patio.
Pat's Cafe,"Nice little quaint place. My husband had ""El ranchero"" (similar to huevos rancheros) and he loved it, he said it was the best breakfast he had in our stay in SF. I had the Corned beef hash, it was good but it had a lot of fat and the toast was too toasted for my liking. The chai latte was delicious! Super creamy. The only thing I didn't like is that you can't do any substitutions, I don't eat eggs, so I ordered my dish with no eggs but would have liked something in exchange like they do in other places. Service was great, very nice servers."
Pat's Cafe,"Pats cafe is THE place for breakfast in north San Fran! Staying at fisherman’s wharf we wanted to go out and grab breakfast. We saw pats cafe on Google thought they looks fun. Fun is just the surface the food is delicious. The stuff are friendly and the place has real character. We loved it so much we went back twice. We’d been traveling across America from New York to Texas then San Fran. We even dropped by the morning we were leaving to Japan. This is the breakfast spot right next to municipal station to so downtown folks are just a ride away. It’s just a fact, go to Pat’s!"
Pat's Cafe,"From day one we had a warm and friendly welcome from the staff and from Pat. A substantial menu was offered and proved to be the most perfect place for brunch. The food and drinks served were spot on and just perfect, with great size portions and nothing too much trouble for this fussy Englishman!  Thank you to all of the staff who made each and every visit so enjoyable and for the coffee that was waiting for us as soon as we walked through the door.  We walked to Pat's from the Greenwich Steps, where we were staying, and every step was worth it."
Pat's Cafe,"It was one of the best breakfast cafes in SF. We ordered the pancakes,  Mexican style chilaquile, and Pat's omelet. All the dishes were really tasty, especially the pancakes."
Pat's Cafe,What a great spot! Literally steps off the trolley this place is great.  The food was super fast and delicious.  The sec is was great and the atmosphere reminded me of a diner from another time.
Pat's Cafe,"Apparently quite the breakfast institute in San Francisco, there was a short queue to get a seat. Staff was very friendly, portions were good and food was nicely presented & tasty. An enjoyable breakfast place."
Pat's Cafe,"Loved this adorable cafe. Perfect place to go for a casual breakfast. The service is outstanding, coffee was constantly being filled. The salmon Benedict was full of flavor and a little messy but worth it."
Pat's Cafe,Great old school diner style breakfast/lunch spot located near fisherman's wharf area of San Francisco. I went for brunch around 1pm the place was pretty empty.  Service was fast and efficient.  I decided to get the California omelette which I thought was very good but over priced.  Overall Pat's Cafe is a good choice if you're looking for a nice home style breakfast.
Pat's Cafe,"We are a big breakfast place, thing slow dow early.  Glad you enjoyed your food and hope to see you soon,"
Pat's Cafe,"Very quaint and busy local breakfast stop that has a wide range of options for those who love a hearty morning meal. The menu includes a wide range of options though I wished for a few more standard offerings like basic eggs, toast, sausage, etc. Lots of omelettes and scrambled eggs but less basic meals in some ways. The service was quick and efficient and the portions were appropriate. They even provided a take away coffee which was great to keep me going the rest of the morning."
Pat's Cafe,Researched this place and couldn’t wait to come here for a brunch! Amazing service from the minute when you walk in and food is lovely 🤩 egg Benedict are unfortunately only served at the weekend but I had San Fran omelette and pancake with fruits. Coffee if just perfect 👍🏻 definitely a stop you can’t miss!
Pat's Cafe,Always love the 5 stars as they indicate you were satisfied with service and food.  Thanks
Pat's Cafe,San Francisco omlete was very good and the French toast. The staff were very kind and swift!
Pat's Cafe,"First time in California, specifically San Francisco & couldn't have done any better! I'm a religious breakfast eater and Pat's Cafe won't be forgotten! French Toast & Home Fries were slammin!!!"
Pat's Cafe,"Lovely, authentic, warm welcome and delicious diner food. Local artists display on walls. Love the Feeling of this place."
Pat's Cafe,"I had the California omelette, it practically was a omelette wrapping the ingredients. It was not cooked together in one piece as omelette should be. The taste wasn't great, just normal. I wouldn't go back again. And it's more expensive than the menu on Google map reports."
Pat's Cafe,This is their crabcake Benedict and it was amazing! I asked for extra Hollandaise sauce and they put it right where I asked. Server was friendly. It was a bit pricey for a breakfast but it was worth it!
Pat's Cafe,"So, I am a FA and for me is always SFO a breakdown into my pocket.  Pat's Cafe was recommended several times before, and I finally made it this time. And let me tell you, this visit didn't disappoint. The House cafe was good and I highly recommend the Mexican Omelette. First of all, I was down when I saw the omelet, but then after I discovered the inside: *mwah*."
Pat's Cafe,I went two times this week to have breakfast before work and the first time I was told that they will be ready in one hour so 8:30 a.m. The second time we were three people outside waiting patiently at 7:35 a.m. while the person inside keep ignoring us. The company has to update your business hours and improve the customer satisfaction. I am ISO 9001  leader so I know about quality :).
Pat's Cafe,Quick stop after church. Our last breakfast in San Francisco. Pat's Cafe was fast and efficient. Kids had chocolate milk that they enjoyed mixing themselves. My wife's croissant sandwich was huge. Also nice that each of the plates comes with a little slice of watermelon.
Pat's Cafe,Thanks for all those stars.  Glad you enjoyed our food and our ambiance.
Pat's Cafe,We came here for breakfast and the food & coffee was delicious. It's not very large inside and we got there early so there was no wait. The staff was friendly and great about refilling the coffee. Lots of great local artwork on the wall for sale. Would definitely come here again.
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for those 5 stars,   glad you enjoyed our food and our  service we try harder! "
Pat's Cafe,"Super cool Café, I love all the artwork on the walls and the cozy atmosphere! Food was delicious and the service impeccable! Amazing place, will eat here again whenever I come back in town! 😊"
Pat's Cafe,"Came here for a low key weekend brunch with friends - I got the pancake special and the pancakes were fluffy and delicious! I went for the OG but they have lots of tasty flavor combos to customize your pancakes, my friends tried the versions with fruit and they looked great!  Overall, the food was a little pricier than I expected but I suppose it's also based on the restaurant location"
Pat's Cafe,"Hi Jing,   Thanks for your feedback. We appreciate your visit.  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,A “cute” cafe that turned out better than expected. I enjoyed a cold salmon eggs Benedict that had wonderful hollandaise sauce.
Pat's Cafe,"We order from Pat's almost every weekend, it's a semi-consistent option for a lazy morning breakfast. I've had some issues with orders being correct but can overlook that however, today I ordered a waffle and the cup of syrup was literally one quarter full not even close to enough to cover 1 portion of the waffle. And the waffle is so dry I can't even eat it without syrup. Pretty disappointed and we are looking for another breakfast spot near us. I guess if you are eating in you will receive better care but for a takeout spot it's not a great option."
Pat's Cafe,I ordered the California omelette and a mimosa. The service was standard. It was a Friday morning and everything felt very relaxed. The food was good. I would return. Definitely split the meals. The omelette was made for 2 for sure.
Pat's Cafe,I would have really liked to give this place an extra star. The omelette was that good. Location and atmosphere were on point. Wayyy overpriced. Toast and bacon were neglected in the toaster/fryer. Coffee was average
Pat's Cafe,"Can get busy on weekends, but we arrived early and beat the crowd. Service is exceptional and the food is good, but nothing noteworthy, especially being in San Francisco amongst so many amazing breakfast spots. I didn’t find Pat’s chicken apple sausages as savory as those from other places. The French toast was good, but also not as good and moist as other spots. Coffee was not strong enough for my tastes. Everything was just okay."
Pat's Cafe,The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Got the salmon and feta scrambled eggs and California omelette.
Pat's Cafe,"Food was good. I had the California omelette ($17.95) with bell peppers added. I thought it was kinda funny that the ingredients were all on the plate and the egg was just placed on top of it, rather than mixed it, but whatever. I also had the pomegranate mimosa ($9.95). It was good. Service was also good. The only thing that startled me was the smell when I walked in. Like they'd maybe done a typical deep clean the night before and it was still kinda sitting. Nobody else seemed to be bothered by it and I didnt read any other reviews for it so probably just a one off."
Pat's Cafe,"Great cafe, amazing choice of food on the menu. Staff were attentive and friendly. Food was good, I ate the veggie sandwich and my husband had the veggie wrap. Both tasted amazing and came with fries. Pretty good value for money considering it’s near north beach and a tourist area. Would recommend if your in the area. They also sell prints of San Francisco, which are good and not too expensive."
Pat's Cafe,"Awesome place to eat, service is top notch, staff is super friendly. The only complaint was that the omelette had barely and cheese, and cheese is super important in an omelette in my opinion"
Pat's Cafe,"Always a go to when I’m in town. Great service from the staff, amazing breakfast and lunch and delicious mimosas!"
Pat's Cafe,"Lovely small cafe, friendly and attentive service. Delicious food. I really enjoyed the chai tea latte."
Pat's Cafe,This place is amazing! Special orders are absolutely no problem and the food is delicious. It would be worth it traveling to sf again only for this cafe! It is quiet expensive for european standards but you won't find anything much cheaper cause it's sf...
Pat's Cafe,"Great place. I will use the phrase ""hole in the wall"" and hope it means the same thing in San Francisco. We loved it. Great food, cute little tucked away location close to everything."
Pat's Cafe,Breakfast here was very nice. Food is good as well. The only thing is the bacon was really well done. Make sure to request how you like that. Other than that I enjoyed this cute little cafe
Pat's Cafe,"great restaurant for locals and people visiting SF! We got there right before they opened (since i had a full day of activities planned for my friend who was visiting) and we were the first people there. i'm glad we got there early because within 30 min, the restaurant was packed!!  the food came out to us very quickly and everything tasted excellent! they need more waiters, but the service was still good. there were some rude large parties wanting to push tables together, likely tourists. can't wait to go back!"
Pat's Cafe,"Arrived at 7.40 for breakfast and were seated near the window. A few clients already seated and place started to fill up quickly. However, we ordered promptly, coffee served but after 35 minutes our breakfast still hadn't arrived. After reminding the server he told us it was coming but it took another 7 or 8 minutes to finally arrive."
Pat's Cafe,"No joke, but the bagels tasted like they were from Safeway or Trader Joe’s. Upon further inspection of walking down the street to Walgreens, I think they came from here, because the bagels look legit identical.  This place is a tourist trap"
Pat's Cafe,Pat's has been around a long time and is a great spot. That said the prices are getting to be outrageous. I ordered pancakes with one egg and bacon. Had a coffee and added one additional egg to my order and the total after I tipped the waiter 20% was $35. Spending $35 on breakfast is a little ridiculous. Have been coming here off and on when I'm in SF but I won't be back again.
Pat's Cafe,Sorry to have read your review.  San Francisco is a very expensive place to do business the minimum wage is going up $1.00 in June or July.  This is the reason for the latest increase.  Sad that You  will not be coming back but wishI’you the best 
Pat's Cafe,The guys working here are absolute clowns. We walked in to a half empty restaurant and no one acknowledged us for several minutes. In that time two more parties walked in and we are all now crowded in the entry. We got seated but were the last to get menus and only after asking. We started noticing several tables getting the food who you guessed came in and ordered after us. The server finally came to us to let us know our ticket never went thru to the kitchen 'because of the tablet'. We left and had a completely opposite experience at Hollywood cafe. Major waste of time.
Pat's Cafe,"Hi Rebekah, thank you for your feedback. I am sorry that you had a bad experience. Hopefully you can give us another try, let us know who you are, and we will treat you. Again, thanks for the feedback; I will address this with my team.  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"My husband and I went for our breakfast here while visiting San Francisco. There are many places to dine in. We chose here as online, it had excellent reviews. We chose right, as the food and service were both excellent 👌. Highly recommend 😁👍😁"
Pat's Cafe,"Nice casual cafe for breakfast and lunch. The French toast special I had was okay; could be improved with cinnamon. The pancakes though was a pleasant surprise; probably one of the fluffiest pancake that I've ever tasted. Staff are friendly, service is reasonably quick, decor inside is filled with local artwork for sale and the place is clean and well spaced out."
Pat's Cafe,"Thank you for coming in for our breakfast and lunch, Adrian! I'm happy you were impressed by our pancakes. Hope this good visit will bring you back our way again soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Fantastic place. I went there for breakfast. Nice classic music. Friendly crew. Yummy food.
Pat's Cafe,"Great location... no large hills to climb to get to it. Comfortable artsy in decor, huge menu that is diverse, weekend specials. Outdoor seating area that is covered but best for a couple small parties of 2 or 3. Can make espresso type drinks. 1/3 the cost of some hotel breakfasts. Photo shows ciliquilles and French toast plates."
Pat's Cafe,Seems you really enjoyed your food.  Hope to see you again.
Pat's Cafe,We were visiting fisherman's ward - yet wanted a good local spot for breakfast - Pats was fantastic- good coffee - veggie omelette had fresh veggies - broccoli asparagus tomato onion spinach feta - excellent and good potatoes with sourdough toast - my lovely wife had oatmeal with raisins bananas cinnamon - she skipped the walnuts - overall a must place for breakfast so much better than the tourist spots and it's just 0.3 miles from warf area
Pat's Cafe,Good to hear you had a good experience at pat’s Cafe.  Remember us next time your in the neighborhood! 
Pat's Cafe,Walkable diner from our hotel While visiting San Francisco. Every bite was delicious. Freshly cooked. House coffee is amazing. It is a must try.
Pat's Cafe,Love those 5 stars and your comments glad your experience was a good one !!!
Pat's Cafe,Steak and eggs was tasty! Food was delivered pretty quickly. During our visit there were several staff members all working to help eachother out!
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for those 4 stars, our servers are the best,  always a TEAM working together."
Pat's Cafe,I can see why there was a line out the door earlier in the brunch hour. I'm glad I came back closer to close when it was a little more quiet  The home fries were perfectly crispy and the coffee was so rich and wonderful. The chorizo burrito was the perfect brunch size!
Pat's Cafe,"We have lived around the corner of Pat's for nesrlu 7 years but finally made it here when we both had a day off. Everything was great. All the food was very ""home"" feeling. Pictured is the French toast with fruit, American style chilequiles and the egg burrito.  Worth noting is that the burrito and chilequiles both came with potatoes but didn't say so on the menu so don't be like us and order a side of potatoes we didn't need!"
Pat's Cafe,"The best french toast I've ever had. In the other pic is californian omelette, which was brilliant too. Everything with tea and tips was 50$."
Pat's Cafe,"California omelet was very tasty, and the atmosphere was very good. My daughter did the Nutella crepes, which she  enjoyed. Little to rich for my breakfast tastes, lol."
Pat's Cafe,"Really good friendly service and very tasty food. Portions on the big side. We ate here twice, we enjoyed it so much. The bloody Mary's are well worth a look"
Pat's Cafe,"We found this little place on our first morning in San Francisco and loved it so much we went back for breakfast the next day too! It's a cozy, clean, friendly little cafe filled with interesting local art and great food. It's also located near the beginning of one of the cable car routes where you can buy daily passport (recommend and worth it). We paid around $25 for a very filling breakfast for two."
Pat's Cafe,"I'm so glad our cozy atmosphere and tasty breakfast had you coming back for more the next day, Lizzy! Thanks for the kind words about our cafe, and I hope you enjoyed the rest of your time in San Francisco! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,I used to rate this place 5 stars. Prices have gone way up (like every where else) portions have gotten smaller as well. Now only one piece of toast comes with your omelette. Food is still good thankfully.
Pat's Cafe,Sorry to have lost that one star.  Glad you still enjoyed our food.
Pat's Cafe,"What a hidden gem of a breakfast spot in the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Fran! Lots of variety, from breakfast classics to original more-adventurous dishes, and a very friendly staff! The breakfast burrito with sweet potato hash was amazing (and huge)! There is indoor and outdoor seating, and, as an added bonus, the walls are covered with local artwork (most of which is available for purchase). Don't hesitate to stop at this awesome family-run breakfast joint!"
Pat's Cafe,"My wife wanted biscuits and gravy for breakfast. She is very particular. I found Pat's Cafe online. A cute little restaurant where you can watch the cable cars pass. We were both amazed at the large portions. They far exceeded expectations. Their corned beef hash tops the charts and the biscuits and gravy made her day. The service was fast, and friendly. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed."
Pat's Cafe,"Patrick, biscuits and gravy for breakfast is the best way to start the day! We're thrilled you and your wife enjoyed our cozy charm and ambiance. You can count on our service and food to always hit the spot. Can't wait to welcome you again. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We sat outside after the rain on New Years day, it was beautiful they had heaters so we stayed warm. We were offered mimosas but just wanted juice, I had the best French toast I have ever had! Our waiter was very busy but gave us more than enough of his time and made us laugh a lot.  Great place I will return when I'm in the city again."
Pat's Cafe,Chilaquilles were delicious and I got 4* big strips of bacon as a side. I appreciated that. That's some generosity. No notes 👏🏼👏🏼
Pat's Cafe,"Very good food and very nice service. The place has a good location, within walking distance from every touristy place. You can see local people getting breakfast here, which is a good indicator. Highly recommended!!"
Pat's Cafe,Good to see those 5 stars and glad you enjoyed our home style cooking.
Pat's Cafe,The food is pretty great and the service is one of a kind. I strongly eating here. They have an awesome item selection and the service is always great here.
Pat's Cafe,The food is average and breakfast is pricey (but it is San Francisco!). The service was great and friendly.
Pat's Cafe,"Juice portion its to small, food tastes very good. Service could be better."
Pat's Cafe,"You were served the 8 oz glass.  Should have been the 12 oz , I’m assuming you ordered the regular size not the small.  Sorry will discuss with servers to make sure proper portions.  Hope to see you again!!"
Pat's Cafe,Service 5* Super friendly welcome everyone as old friends  Food: Delicious food had the omelette and honestly the sour dough bread was delicious!  Price/value: A bit pricy for breakfast but worth the stop
Pat's Cafe,Delicious and they greeted us in the most welcoming way. Highly recommend it!
Pat's Cafe,"Adorable neighborhood gem! Super-friendly staff and excellent food. Go for the El Ranchero for a hearty breakfast meal or Go Really Wild Waffles if you have a sweet tooth. This place is busy but will always have a spot for you, so don't waste your time standing in line at the tourist traps. We will definitely visit Pat's again."
Pat's Cafe,"Love the 5 stars, yes we are friendly and have good food, thanks for commenting  Pst of Pat’s Cafe"
Pat's Cafe,Cute little place.  The staff was excellent. I got the breakfast burrito with sausage Egg and it had Black beans Etc. It was really good.  And it came with avocado sour cream  and little cute potatoes.
Pat's Cafe,Gor seated party of 4 during busy morning right away. Waiter came by and was very attentive. Food was good and service was great.
Pat's Cafe,"Food was hot and was well seasoned. We were impressed with the flavor of the sausage gravy. Burger was well done and not dry. Waiter was very polite, tipped well. Would come back."
Pat's Cafe,Glad to hear you enjoyed our food.  We like flavor!!!  Hope to see you soon.  Pat of Pat’s Csfe
Pat's Cafe,Great slightly out-of-the-way cafe that is a real gem and worth seeking out. We had an amazing lunch served well in a nice clean café.  If you are in the area definitely worth seeking out.
Pat's Cafe,This place has the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. Their hollandaise sauce is so good. Small area but very colorful and cute. Didn't have to wait for a table and service was great. Waiter was very nice and patient. Adorable outside store front and the other food was great too.
Pat's Cafe,"Bo, I'm thrilled you're a fan of out eggs Benedict! It's wonderful our decor and service were both to your satisfaction. We hope we'll see you again soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Worth a stop if you are in the city.  Great breakfast and lunch menu.  We left satisfied after generous portions.
Pat's Cafe,"This spot was a hit for my entire family of 5.  Some of us even ordered seconds 😉 the eggs Benedict, pancakes, Nutella crepes and waffles were winners and the home fries were loved by all."
Pat's Cafe,Solid french toast and they offer real maple syrup! Chicken sausages were good. Very good and fast service. Wish the portions were bigger
Pat's Cafe,"The best Benny I've ever had!! Do not miss a chance to try their cloud-like pancakes and delicious cappuccino, all delivered with spectacular service!"
Pat's Cafe,"Great place! Tiny kitchen kept up with the busy brunch rush. Staff was friendly and efficient. I had the pancake special. Fluffy cake, egg was nice and fluffy. My companion had the Polk Street omelet. Well cooked, lots of veggies. The room is cozy and welcoming. Thanks!"
Pat's Cafe,Uber kid friendly place.  I mean UBER. Food is nothing to write home about. Hard working staff but what do you expect when it’s one of the few places open before 8AM?
Pat's Cafe,"Very busy cafe, a little bit of a wait. I ordered crab cake Benedict. It was ok but the crab cake wasn't that great. The eggs and hollandaise sauce was nice. There were a lot of potatoes and was a bit too filling. The chai latte was really sweet and I couldn't finish it. Service was quick and was fine."
Pat's Cafe,"While we're glad to have welcomed you by, Renee, I'm sorry you didn't love your meal. We prepare every dish with quality ingredients so you can ensure the best. We regret we couldn't address this matter in person and hope we're able to welcome you back in the future for a fantastic meal. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Far from dennys quality! Staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, not one thing to complain about & their coffee, amazing!"
Pat's Cafe,Great little place. Delicious breakfast. We had the Mexican omlette and California omlette.
Pat's Cafe,The breakfast here is pretty great and the service is always friendly. They have a great menu selection and their prices are reasonable.
Pat's Cafe,We went for holidays in October at this restaurant it was our second time (the first we were without our kids ) and 8 years later we went with our kids for them to discover the pat’s cafe because our first experience was awesome. For our second experience it was the same the food is  absolutely delicious the staff is so nice we explained to them it was our second time and they toik time to speak a bit with us it was cool for us to work our english and to know the lady who has the restaurant she so nice ! We are French and we really liked a lot this restaurant fir the food and also for the people we met If you go to San Francisco it’s a place to go because it’s fantastic ! Thank you to Pat and her waiters for hosting us and see you in 8 years with our kids and maybe grandchildren 😁
Pat's Cafe,We were looking for a non-touristy brunch restaurant not too far from Pier 39 and lombard street. This place was perfect. The food was very good and prices were fair (16 and 18$). I recommend
Pat's Cafe,Everything is cooked to order so be prepared to wait. The food is delicious!
Pat's Cafe,"Service, menu, and flavors were top notch. Also highly recommend the soju Bloody Mary. We went for breakfast and it is one of our favorite spots in SF so far!"
Pat's Cafe,"Excellent little spot for breakfast. Crab cake Benedict was my wife’s highlight. Home fries were also delicious. Service was super friendly, food was fast, and coffee refilled quickly. Make the quick walk!"
Pat's Cafe,"John, happy to hear our Crab cake Benedict didn't disappoint! We're thrilled our service left you with a wonderful impression as well. Looking forward to welcoming you and your wife again sometime soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We would eat there again to be sure, just had to reacquaint ourselves with the costs involved... I had a yummy omelet, grandma had pancakes, son had steak fajitas....yummy!"
Pat's Cafe,"Best place in San Francisco for breakfast. Everything on the menu is great. My personal favs are the breakfast burrito, California omelette and pancakes."
Pat's Cafe,Staff were friendly and welcoming. Lovely feel to the place. A genuine experience at a small and friendly cafe.
Pat's Cafe,"Came here Monday morning, and there was a short wait. This place does not do substitutions, but there's no need to! Lots of different breakfast options, there's something for everyone. This is a heavy breakfast spot, and close to Lombard street, so stop by here and walk it off after!"
Pat's Cafe,"You won't have to worry about options when you're here, Judith! We're delighted to see you had a fantastic visit. Hope to see you around the next time you're in the area. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"The staff was great however the food was cold when it got to the table. Other than that, it was a great experience."
Pat's Cafe,The food was great and the service too! It is a small restaurant and felt a bit crammed during the time I went for breakfast. No open spaces as the tables are close to each other. I guess the more the merrier. If you don't mind the limited space then this restaurant is great for quality food. Eggs Benedict was delicious!
Pat's Cafe,It's great to see our eggs Benedict hit the spot! Our spot cozy spot is a great place to get your day started. Hope you'll make your way back to us again in the future. -Pat
Pat's Cafe,The food is pretty great here and the service is one of a kind. I strongly recommend trying them out you can.
Pat's Cafe,Ordered french toast with fruits and it was super yum! And portion was perfect. Giving it 4 stars because coffee was a burnt :(
Pat's Cafe,"cheap breakfast, really friendly staff , fast ordering and big portions.  Everybody who stays near the cafe and doesn't want a expensive hotel breakfast/lunch has to go there. It is really worth it!"
Pat's Cafe,"We're glad you enjoyed your time with us, Peter, and we appreciate the excellent review! Looking forward to seeing you back next time. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Great breakfast spot with plenty of seating and plentiful portions of fresh ingredients.
Pat's Cafe,"Great breakfast. Coffee was okay, huevos rancheros were quite good. Cozy atmosphere that’s inviting to stay for a long late brunch. We loved the place and would definitely come back."
Pat's Cafe,"Starting the day with a fresh cup of coffee and a plate of Huevos Rancheros is the way to do it! We're thrilled you enjoyed our brunch, and we can't wait to welcome you again sometime soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,We had delicious American pancakes with fruits and maple syrup. The restaurant is well-kept and clean and there are art works on the walls available for sale. The staff was friendly and attentive.
Pat's Cafe,Happy you enjoyed the pancakes with the fruits and maple syrup! Thank you for your kind words about our clean environment and community-centric decorations. Our friendly team is here for you any time! Come visit us again soon. -Pat
Pat's Cafe,"The food is super delicious and the portion is full, the staff introduced enthusiastically,"
Pat's Cafe,"We had a great breakfast, good menu and good food and service. What more could you need for breakfast"
Pat's Cafe,"Great service, very friendly staff. Very nice omelettes and good coffee!"
Pat's Cafe,"Great little down to earth cafe. We found it through Google maps when we planned to go to Mama’s on Washington Square but were put off by the queues.  Pat’s was 5 mins around the corner and was a lucky find! I had French toast with fruit and it was sublime! My friend had the pancakes with scrambled egg, bacon and some fruit too and she loved her food. The dishes were full of flavour, well cooked and typical US sized portions!  There are plenty of breakfast options to enjoy plus lunch items too.  The juices and coffee were ok but not as good as i have enjoyed elsewhere. Service was prompt and friendly. The place is quite old but it was clean and welcoming."
Pat's Cafe,"Happy to hear we could win you over with a tasty breakfast, Melanie! Thanks for the excellent review and feedback for our team. We look forward to next time. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"My wife had to send her plate back bc her meal was under cooked, along with my bacon. Pancakes were heavy when I was expecting them to be light and fluffy ~ 🤔🤨 …"
Pat's Cafe,"Sorry you had a bad experience, hope you will give us another try🙃🙃"
Pat's Cafe,An authentic neighbourhood cafe with great food and friendly staff. A must visit when in SF.
Pat's Cafe,"Awesome food,staff and prices. If service could get 10 stars they definetly deserve it. Thank you for such a nice stay would definetly come again!"
Pat's Cafe,Classic diner breakfast food. Pancakes (especially with certain varieties like blueberries or banana) are excellent. Good service. Very friendly.
Pat's Cafe,Solid breakfast options at a reasonable price. Friendly service and good vegetarian options.
Pat's Cafe,This is very good food place😍 servers are very nice and portions are huuuuuge and delicious 🤤
Pat's Cafe,"Can’t get better than a Pat’s for breakfast! After refusing to queue for a famous breakfast a few streets down from Pat’s cafe we stumbled upon this gem and was not disappointed! All staff were very friendly and welcoming and the food was delicious, particularly the pancakes and Pat’s hash! Recommend all visiting San Francisco to spend your mornings here!"
Pat's Cafe,"I'm glad everything was satisfactory for your breakfast, Lawrence! It's great our team could show you what we can do best welcoming our customers. I'm happy you're a fan of our pancakes and hash. Hope we'll see you next time you're around. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Pat’s was amazing! The bagel and lox was delicious! Great outdoor and indoor options (including a heater if you want it). I told the staff I was in a bit of a hurry and they were so helpful and quick. I will definitely be back!
Pat's Cafe,Went early on a Thursday morning.  No wait and food was delicious.  We bought a piece of art from the wall. We definitely got our money's worth.
Pat's Cafe,Love the 5 stars and sooo glad you enjoyed our delicious food.  Pat of Pat’s Cafe
Pat's Cafe,"Food was delicious, small restaurant but very quick and busy! We came here after finding out Mama’s was closed due to equipment failure and I’m SO glad we found it!! The servers were so sweet also!!"
Pat's Cafe,"Sarah,I'm so glad you found us too! Thanks for stopping by. We hope to have you back soon! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Quaint little hole in the wall few blocks away from fisherman’s wharf. Pretty good food with good service, Pat is a very nice young lady. A bit overpriced but very good overall"
Pat's Cafe,"I appreciate your visit, Daniel! Happy everything from our food to service was great. It was so nice to meet you -- hope to see you in again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We had breakfast at pat‘s cafe today. Almost all tables were taken but luckily we could sit down immediately. We were offered coffee and the waiter brought the menu very fast. We decided to order the french toast with fruit and the oatmeal. We did not have to wait very long until the fold came. One could taste that they made it fresh, also it was still hot, which we liked a lot. The french toast was incredibly delicious. The oatmeal was okay as well but did not have a lot of taste, I would add some cinnamon or ground nuts. Also more fruit would have been good. As soon as the cup of coffee was not full anymore, a waiter came and filled it up again, thank you!! It was not too loud in the restaurant.  The prices are pretty high, most dishes for breakfast are between 17-20$. I would still recommend the restaurant, as the waiters were very attentive and the food was definitely homemade."
Pat's Cafe,My husband and I visited this breakfast spot twice. The service was the best we experienced in San Francisco. The food was delicious. Absolutely try the eggs Benedict!
Pat's Cafe,Spinach salad was super yummy! My husband had the chicken quesadilla we also enjoyed. Nice place a short walk from pier 39 and shorter walk to Lombard St. Perfect stopping point while waking the tourist sites.
Pat's Cafe,"Awesome to hear you enjoyed your meal, Tayla! Thanks for checking us out -- we hope to see you back this way soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Delicious food and the portions are huge. Rather crowded during the weekend but the wait time was quite short. Definitely recommend for breakfast.
Pat's Cafe,"Cezary, we're so glad we're a breakfast favorite of yours! Even though we were a but busier, I'm glad the wait time could still be short. Thanks for the recommendation!  - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Comfortable ambient. Great brunch selection. Various mimosas to choose from. Excellent hollandaise sauce...  Right by the cable car stop. Go, give it a try!"
Pat's Cafe,"Trenton, thanks for sharing your support! I'm glad you had a great time here, and I hope you'll be back again sometime soon for more in the future.  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,The food is amazing here and the services is one of a kind. They have a great menu selection and the service staff are one of a kind.
Pat's Cafe,"Pat’s Cafe is cozy and comfy, employees were friendly. The croissant was really good! I like the coffee and fresh juice! Would go again!"
Pat's Cafe,"Coffee and croissants are the perfect start to any morning, Sharon! We're thrilled you enjoyed. Looking forward to serving you again in the future. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,great food!! cute place and the service was really fast!
Pat's Cafe,"Breakfast was ok, I had Egg Benedict with potatoes, could be a little warmer and the Toast was not crispy"
Pat's Cafe,The service was great and the food was amazing too! Always passed by this place and wanted to try so we finally did and loved it. Great brunch place in North Beach and will definitely come back for more ❤
Pat's Cafe,"Jamie, we're excited you could join us for a delicious brunch while you were in town! From our breakfast dishes to our service, you won't be let down. We hope to see you again in the future. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Consistently amazing breakfast for the last 15 years I've gone.  I've never had to wait for a coffee refill, all the ingredients are fresh and full of flavor, and the menu has something for everyone. This place is a true locals favorite."
Pat's Cafe,"We're so glad you enjoyed visiting us, Louisa! Can't wait to see you again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"August 2022. The staff is rude and not friendly, average food, and expensive. They automatically charged 20% for the tip. You can easily find other places better than this one."
Pat's Cafe,Great breakfast spot in San Francisco. Excellent food and amazing service!
Pat's Cafe,The food was good but not that great. Pancakes were average. The potatoes however were amazing. The stagg was very friendly. We had to move to another table though because the table smelled like it was cleaned with a dirty rag. The staff was very accomadating.
Pat's Cafe,"While it's good to know that the staff was attentive, your meal and table should also be outstanding. Please don't hesitate to let us know whenever there's an issue with your food -- we're here to help. Hope to see you here again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Great breakfast spot. Cozy atmosphere with very friendly and attentive staff (I was asked if I wanted my coffee refilled 3 different times in a 5 minute stretch). Try the biscuits with sausage gravy.
Pat's Cafe,Best place to Brunch in San Francisco. Excelent food and amazing staff
Pat's Cafe,"Good location, amazing food, very nice service. Highly recommended"
Pat's Cafe,"wonderful food, great service and an authentic charm. highly recommend to anyone wanting to support small business with high quality service and fare"
Pat's Cafe,The pancakes with fresh fruit were a relief after fatty breakfast from IHOP previous day!
Pat's Cafe,"We loved Pat's Cafe! We had the chicken wraps and cheeseburger, and couldn't fault the quality of the food. We're from the UK so very much appreciated a good cup of English Breakfast tea too! The staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive, and we would definitely be back if visiting the city again!"
Pat's Cafe,"I had the Polk Street omelet. Absolutely delicious. They sautéed the onions and ham before they went in the omelet, perfect. Coffee (whatever it was) was fantastic. Service was extremely fast and competent. I recommend wholeheartedly."
Pat's Cafe,Simple but good food. Friendly and helpful staff.
Pat's Cafe,Excellent chilaquiles and nice outdoor seating. Service was definitely relaxed and am definitely going to come back for brunch :)
Pat's Cafe,"Food is ok, I had the steak and eggs, and she had the chilaquiles. We both agreed the potatoes were very bland. It seems to have mediocre service if you’re outside as it took 20 minutes to get a coffee refill."
Pat's Cafe,Very nice breakfast place ! And I can tell you the coffee is good (I 'm French). We enjoyed so much we went there twice.
Pat's Cafe,So happy you stopped in! Hoping you'll come back our way. -Pat
Pat's Cafe,"Pro's: the service was really nice. They kept filling up my coffee and everything. A nice overall homie filling to the restuarant  Con's: the food was not up the price you pay for it imo. 15 dollars for 2 small pieces of french toast, an egg and sausage is a bit too steppe for me."
Pat's Cafe,Average food. Just another American diner with normal breakfast options. Very friendly staff. The coffee was really not good at all. The interior needs a bit of an update as its starting to feel old. If you like huge amounts of food this is the place for you.
Pat's Cafe,"Visiting SF and this cafe was the closest to my hotel.  Ordered 2 large almond milk cappuccinos, order of Belgian waffles, side of bacon and home style fries.  Large Cappuccino came in regular size cups and found out when I got back to the hotel the bacon was missing.  All these for $40!"
Pat's Cafe,Love places like this! Complete dive atmosphere with great service and breakfast food!
Pat's Cafe,"The food was pricey which is normal I think in San Francisco in comparison to breakfast spots at home. This would have been forgiven if the food was good like at other breakfast spots I've tried. The eggs were the most rubbery eggs I've ever had and the French toast was just okay, but the sausage was pretty tough."
Pat's Cafe,"Came here for breakfast. Food was delicious, came fast and in perfect portions. My friends had mimosas and I decided to try the pomosa (pomegranate juice instead of orange juice) - it was good! Staff here were so nice! We had a great time."
Pat's Cafe,So good to see those 5 stars.  We are proud of our fast and attentive service.  Hope to see you shakn.
Pat's Cafe,Very good place for breakfast.
Pat's Cafe,"Love the food here! Both pancakes and French toast are amazing, and good service as well! Nice and clean."
Pat's Cafe,"Francesca, happy to hear our pancakes and French toast hit the spot! We look forward to welcoming you back for another delicious meal soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,An absolutely wonderful staff/owner greeted us close to the closing time and allowed us to stay and eat. The food was AMAZING and my group had some great drinks as well (espresso drinks and mimosas). I am vegan/vegetarian and they had GREAT options for me. I 100% recommend this hidden gem close to Fisherman’s Wharf and Pier 39! I wish I could go here every day for brunch and a beautiful artsy atmosphere/outdoor spot. 🤍
Pat's Cafe,"Great service, the food was delicious! It was a lovely place."
Pat's Cafe,"Sitlaly, it makes us smile to see you had a lovely visit! Delicious food and great service can't go without one another. Hope to see you around in the future. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Such a wonderful establishment, good food, good mood and plenty of quality products with a convivial staff"
Pat's Cafe,"Super friendly staff, great service and food/coffee, thanks we will be back!"
Pat's Cafe,"Cool, quaint breakfast joint. The food was great  and so was the service. You have to go here when you visit San Francisco!"
Pat's Cafe,"Thank you for visiting us, Grant! I'm happy to hear you loved the food and our service. Hope we'll have the pleasure to welcome you back soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Perfect for just coffee and a stroll on Lombard st. Great service, friendly people . Pat is also helping out with the seating or greeting . We ordered coffee to go and it’s so good . Will deff come back here next time and I highly recommend a quick stop from the cable cars. Reasonable price for a coffee, thank you Pat’s Cafe 💥💥 …"
Pat's Cafe,"We're exited to hear you had a great visit, Johanna, and appreciate your review. See you next time! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,I ordered french toast! And a guy forced me to believe that this was the french toast. I wonder what is their pancakes look like??? If someone could please let me know.
Pat's Cafe,Loved this place. They set up a new table for us outside with our dog.  Soju bloody marry was great. Omelette was even better. Super fast and friendly service
Pat's Cafe,"Picked's ""Pat's"" based on proximity of my hotel and reviews.  Great decision on my part!  Friendly service and delicious meal (I had the ""sauteed salmon benedict"")"
Pat's Cafe,"Good spot for breakfast. Had the veggie omelette and it was delicious; the grilled veggies were very tasty. The staff was friendly and overall a really nice, casual spot."
Pat's Cafe,"Cute little dinner, only serves breakfast. Food is exactly what you would expect from a diner: eggs, pancakes, french toast etc. Well made and well prepared, but nothing new. Definitely, the place to go for a good comfort breakfast."
Pat's Cafe,"Jessica, we appreciate you coming to see us! We want everyone to enjoy our amazing food and friendly team. If there's anything that would make next visit better, I hope you can let us know! - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"The restaurant in front of our hotel was packed. We came here as an alternative, I'm glad we did. The coffee was fresh, the food was good, and it was pleasantly quaint."
Pat's Cafe,Great breakfast. Very close to Fisherman’s Wharf.
Pat's Cafe,"Great food, coffee, background music....  Gotta Go......"
Pat's Cafe,"Food was ok. Wife really liked grits and French toast. Ordered from grubhub, and order didn't come how we ordered. Eggs were chopped, not scrambled as specified. Another order came with chopped eggs, not omelet as specified and neither had any cheese as specified. Probably would have been better if we dined in. I may try out again before leaving the are. If so I will update."
Pat's Cafe,"Wonderful, intimate breakfast spot, a great alternative to tourist-y places near Fishermen's Wharf.  Food is delicious; coffee unusually good and the service is exceptionally friendly and competent."
Pat's Cafe,OMG!!! Thank you for being so kind. We came 10 minutes before you opened and let us sit inside. We ordered Togo. Best home fries ever! California omelette was so good! Thank you for your hospitality. For visitors plus time difference and starving Marvin’s. Thank you would recommend you to anyone that asks.
Pat's Cafe,Good place to come and have some breakfast. The prices a good and the food is even better!
Pat's Cafe,I'm so happy to hear that you could come enjoy some breakfast with us. Thanks for the review! - Pat
Pat's Cafe,Nice local place for breakfast. Freindly staff and large portions of food. Short walk from Fisherman's Wharf on Taylor Street next to cable car turnaround.
Pat's Cafe,"Doug, thanks so much for joining us for a nice breakfast. Happy to have you here. Come back soon! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"What a great little cafe, excellent coffee and food. No fuss, nice and relaxed atmosphere. A great place to have breakfast"
Pat's Cafe,"Brett, a delicious, no-fuss breakfast is the best way to start the day. I'm happy you can come in here for a relaxing atmosphere and a good meal! I hope you'll come back and see us soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We stopped by Pat’s Cafe today for breakfast.  Man were we impressed !   The food was so delicious. We ordered the biscuits and gravy.  Ok let’s start with that…. We are from KY. Biscuits and gravy is kind of a staple in the south.  Well,  I don’t think I’ve had better (except my grandmother’s) anywhere.  Next up… the Polk omelette.  The vegetables were fresh, ham was excellent, just the right amount of cheese, and the eggs were oh so fluffy!  Let’s talk pancakes, loved those also.  Light and fluffy with thick syrup to top them. The chicken apple sausage was so good.  And finally….. $$$$$. Their prices were on point!  We were surprised at how reasonable their menu was priced. Oh, did I forget how awesome and inviting their staff is?  Do yourself a favor and visit Pat’s Cafe!"
Pat's Cafe,"Solid diner/cafe. No frills, but the best service I’ve had in quite a long time and the food is great. You can tell they genuinely care about their customers and want to give them a great experience."
Pat's Cafe,Wonderful hot chocolate and very nice location a little bit off beaten path. Friendly staff! Thank you!
Pat's Cafe,Good food great service
Pat's Cafe,Amazing service and exquisite food! The service here was better than any 5 star restaurant I've visited. Will return every time I visit San Francisco.
Pat's Cafe,"The comfort of a delicious home-style breakfast never gets old, Ricky. We're happy we had the chance to serve you. Looking forward to your next visit to San Francisco. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,3 people ate here. Overall Fair; coffee & breakfast lukewarm. Wife’s crepe good.  They took off charge for the 2 lattes: poor taste & not hot.
Pat's Cafe,"Great spot for breakfast, close to the Wharf and downtown. The banana granola pancakes are fantastic! Service very friendly and quick. Clean restrooms."
Pat's Cafe,"Happy to hear you enjoy our place, Alicia! Thanks for visiting -- we hope to see you back soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Breakfast was good but not impressive. Coffee could be better.
Pat's Cafe,"This is one of those places that if you judged by the looks alone, it'd be a hard pass. We gave it a try anyway. And I'm glad we Did! Their biscuits and sausage gravy are quite delicious! The BLT was excellent as well. It took very little time from the time we ordered until we received our order. Service was good and quite friendly. My advice, don't judge this book by its cover."
Pat's Cafe,"Good to see those 5 stars.  Yes we are a bit old school in looks, but our home style cooking speaks for itself."
Pat's Cafe,Never even got our food. Terrible service  would never go back
Pat's Cafe,"Hi Jared, thank you for your feedback. I am sorry to hear about your experience. Hopefully you can give us another try; it will be on the house. I will address your feedback with my team.  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Home cooked  breakfast , great coffee, and very friendly owner. I had french toast and portion size was large and very good quality. Even get to meet the owner Ms. Pat she was personally cleaning the table and serving the guest. I highly recommend this place for breakfast"
Pat's Cafe,"Nothing special at this breakfast cafe at the end of Taylor street where the cable cars turnaround..  their Chiquiles American style dish gad no flavor … bland as can be.  Also ordered the healthy old fashioned oats but was also disappointed… super dry not enough moisture in the oatmeal.  Plenty of better breakfast cafes on the area like Mana’s, Hollywood Cafe or 8am cafe…"
Pat's Cafe,"Nice brunch place, we visited on a weekday so there are seating available right away."
Pat's Cafe,Great pancakes!!!🥞 🥞 Nice cafe with good food!! …
Pat's Cafe,"Eli, we're so glad you could visit us! Hoping you come back our way again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Not up to the hype. The corned beef hash was 3/4 veggies and a smattering of corned beef.  Would also have preferred to be able to sub another cheese for the feta that seems to be used on all their items.  If you don’t like feta there are not a lot of other options but no substitutions are allowed.  Also expected better bread especially since it is SF.  Denny’s style sourdough doesn’t make it.
Pat's Cafe,"Fun vibe and friendly staff. Food was good, probably worth almost 4 stars. No maple syrup, which was too bad. We got lattes, traditional eggs Benedict, and their fruit crepes. Eggs on the Benedict were cooked nicely."
Pat's Cafe,"Excellent food, attentive wait staff. Loved the art and the ambiance."
Pat's Cafe,"Mari, the charm of our cafe makes each meal that much tastier! I'm so pleased our staff took good care of you. Hope to see you back our way sometime again. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Save your money and go elsewhere. It's a tourist trap, extremely expensive, the food and service is subpar.  Specific food critique: The $4 bagel on the menu with butter - no choice and type of bagel, comes with plastic smokers jam, and resembles a Costco bagel.  The corned beef eggs and hash, are simply large cubes of corned beef, not tender, and served with no hash.  The omelets appear to be made fine, tasted a pancake which was fine. All in all it's two times the cost and half the quality. If you need a quick bite to eat before running I guess, otherwise look elsewhere."
Pat's Cafe,Great place for breakfast or lunch Friendly staff Fast serving
Pat's Cafe,Best pancakes ever! Really great service
Pat's Cafe,"Great experience. We were on East Coast time and arrived right at 0730. It was quiet, and the service was great!!!"
Pat's Cafe,"I'm so glad you arrived just in time for a delicious breakfast, Johnson! Thanks for checking in. We'll be happy to have you back next time you're in town. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Solid Breakfast, the Biscuits and Gravy was amazing. I would definitely frequent this place. The service was very good and fast."
Pat's Cafe,"Really good. But a little to less for  5 stars. Very friendly, tasty breakfast..."
Pat's Cafe,"We're glad you visited us, Stephan! We'll see you next time. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Nice place to have breakfast. Very good omelette!
Pat's Cafe,"traditional breakfast, cozy. nicely cooked eggs, delicious french toast. overall very good quality service/ food. recommend for those times when you want things simple and filling to start your day."
Pat's Cafe,"well i got the pancakes with fruit and my boyfriend got the french toast with 2 sunny side eggs. as well as a hot chocolate DELICIOUS 🫶🏼🫶🏼! i liked the service and the interior, super cute."
Pat's Cafe,Delish! Great morning mini scavenger hunt to find. Quaint and welcoming! Well rewarded with great coffee/latte and scrumptious food! Yum!
Pat's Cafe,"You can't start the day without a delicious cup of coffee, Rosemary! While it might have been a journey to find, we're sure glad you did. Hope to welcome you again the next time you're in the area. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Best breakfast anywhere!  We live in Colorado but absolutely LOVE Pat's Cafe and make sure to visit it every time we go to San Francisco (in fact, we always stay at a hotel nearby just so we have a short walk to breakfast here).  Food is always amazing with service to match.  Can't wait to go back!"
Pat's Cafe,"Food was okay, but a little pricey for the quality of that and service. An honest accident, but the server didn't put our order in when we'd placed it, so we'd waited quite a while. It was a really quaint place for conversation though. Menu could use a revamp- slight self-contradictions in the text. Nice small place."
Pat's Cafe,"We had a great breakfast this morning.  Service was nice,  didn't have to wait on a late Sunday morning.  I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict with arugula.  I thought I would only be able to eat half,  but I managed the whole thing.  Husband had shrimp crepes and said it was good (there did appear to be too much green peppers left on his plate). Only had a black coffee and iced tea so can't comment on the beverage choices.  I would recommend and return."
Pat's Cafe,"Melinda, happy to hear you enjoyed your Sunday morning breakfast! You can't go wrong with tasty eggs Benedict. It's great to know both you and your husband loved it. Looking forward to welcoming you guys again in the future. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,A bit Overpriced but the food was good.
Pat's Cafe,Great coffee and breakfast. Went twice while in San Fran and the service was great. Get there early its popular
Pat's Cafe,Couldn’t have stubbled across any place better. This place has the most amazing staff full of life. The food was so top notch we went two days in a row for breakfast. If you are looking for awesome food in San Francisco stop by and give Pat’s Cafe a try you will not regret a single bite.
Pat's Cafe,Thanks for the 5 stars.  Hope you will come by again so that we can take good  care of you.  Pat of Pat ‘s Cafe
Pat's Cafe,Service was very slow.  Food was only so so.  Can't recommend this place.
Pat's Cafe,"Great cappuccino, wide choice for breakfast. Polite staff. What more do you want? Recommended"
Pat's Cafe,Beautiful little café with friendly staff and delicious food. The French toast is amazing!
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for coming by, Roger! I'm so glad you enjoyed our French toast and appreciated our team's customer service. We'll look forward to welcoming you back again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Solid local place. Super fast service, good vibe. Walking distance from fisherman's wharf. Large portions as well. Visit everytime when in SF. Thumbs up"
Pat's Cafe,Great made to order breakfast!
Pat's Cafe,"Excellent all around! Good sized portions and freshly made. My family enjoyed all our dishes. My waffle was crisp on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. The berries were fresh and paired well with the Nutella. I balanced the sweet with the grits and cheese. Highly recommended!"
Pat's Cafe,"Delender, the best waffles are crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle. I'm glad you enjoyed everything. We'll be glad to have you back anytime. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Cappuccino was not convincing. French toast was good & Joe's special as well.
Pat's Cafe,Excellent breakfast and waitstaff!
Pat's Cafe,"This place is awesome and can really use the support during these trying times. I visited here for breakfast. They are adhering to COVID protocols which is great, but they are struggling to stay open. The food is really good and decently priced. I had order a black coffee(tasted pretty damn good) and a chorizo and egg burrito. The burrito was really good flavorful and it comes with a side of hash potatoes(cubed cut) that tasted pretty good and worked well with the flavour of the burrito. If you do go here I'd recommend getting the food to go and to walk down to the pier and eat while looking out toward Alcatraz (which is a very beautiful view)."
Pat's Cafe,So glad to have read your awesome review!   Thanks and isn’t San Francisco a wonderful city to walk around in!!!
Pat's Cafe,Wow! The portions are very generous and you even get free coffee refills and the staff were so generous they let us take a coffee away. The pancakes and bacon were delicious and they had a good variety of eggs. Although slightly pricey the portions made up you were paying for what you got. My only complaint would be that I didn't feel my bagel was home made and didn't live up to other bagel standards. But for a traditional American breakfast 9/10
Pat's Cafe,"All expectations and more were satisfied when we enjoyed a warm clean breakfast for two. The Corned Beef Hash and California Crepe were delicious. The service was cordial but certainly leaves room for improvement. Overall, we were very pleased with our decision to start the day at Pat’s! -thanks."
Pat's Cafe,"David, when people choose to start their day with us, we want the experience to make a good impression that lasts all day. We think delicious food and friendly service is the best way to put a smile on people's faces. Thanks for the review, and come back and see us anytime!  Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Superb feed, big portions, great service and quick. Cheers Pat! The Welsh boys :)"
Pat's Cafe,"Cheers, Martin! Thanks for swinging by. Glad you enjoyed the food and our service -- nothing beats a happy meal. Hope to see you in again soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We had breakfast at Pat's and it was wonderful! I felt like a local in this cool little cafe. The food was excellent, I recommend the SF spinach omelet! You'll definitely get all of your food groups in with as much food as they give you! We also got to meet Pat, she was great! Definitely check this place out if you plan to visit Pier 39 later in the day."
Pat's Cafe,"Everyone's a local here, Maggie! Thank you for dropping by on your way to the Pier 39. It gave me such a great pleasure to greet you all. Glad you loved the spinach omelet. Hope you'd find your way back to us when you're in town. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Thank you Edwardo!! Great service!! The breakfast was excellent, full flavored, great presentation!! 5 star   Your missing out if you are unwilling to travel to this spot!! Feels like Home tastes like Home!! Price point for the Bay is easy on the pocket🥳 HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! …"
Pat's Cafe,"The comfort of home will settle in after your first bite, Steve! Everything from our hearty dishes to the wonderful service from Edwardo will have you looking forward to your return. Hope to welcome you again for some more soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Amazing food, friendly service, and a good vibe.  A bit pricey, but worth it!  A definite lucky find on our trip."
Pat's Cafe,"Great food, great service. Normal prices."
Pat's Cafe,"Everything about this place was wonderful. The service, the food and the atmosphere!!"
Pat's Cafe,My first time at Pat’s. I love it here! The food was delicious! I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. The best breakfast I have ever had! The coffee was also great! Well worth the wait. If you want a wonderful tasting breakfast then this is the place for you.
Pat's Cafe,Thanks for coming in! I'm happy you loved the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and our coffee. Glad we gave you a great first impression -- hope it'll bring you back our way soon. - Pat
Pat's Cafe,This place is delish! Amazing food! Went 2 days in a row!
Pat's Cafe,"Tami, I'm honored to hear you loved your first visit so much you came back a day later! Thanks for your review -- it brought such a smile to my face. Hope we can welcome you back again soon! - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We really enjoyed this adorable Cafe on our small tour of San Fran! 😊 The French toast, pancakes, and philly cheestakes were AMAZING!!!! 😊😊 The staff was very friendly and we got to meet Pat herself, made my kids day! 😊 We highly recommend stopping by for a bite!! …"
Pat's Cafe,It was a cute little mom and pop shop in San Francisco. The owner has her own cut outs and was at the restaurant checking in on customers. Our waiter was very friendly and nice. It's a nice change of pace to the city rushed life. The food was affordable and tasty.
Pat's Cafe,"Abbigale, it's wonderful to know you loved the vibe and the service here, and we really appreciate you taking a moment of your time to voice your support. Thanks for the feedback -- you're always welcome here.  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"This hidden gem was recommended to us and glad we found it! The strawberry and Greek salads were a perfect treat after a long drive. Came back the the next day to enjoy breakfast, and was rewarded with a very tasty corned beef hash and fresh fruit crepes. Wish Mom were here to enjoy the cool classic music - she would have loved to reminisce to. An extra big nod to Pat for supporting local artists. Double thumbs up!!"
Pat's Cafe,"After a long drive, I'm glad our fresh salads restored some energy back in you, Tami! Thanks for dining with us twice! I hope we'll see you back next time you're in town. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,The breakfast here is pretty amazing and the service is one of a kind. I recommend giving them a try when you have a chance.
Pat's Cafe,"The service was great, really nice people, but the food needed lots of flavor. I got the chilaquiles but the vegetables were too raw for my taste , in Mexico you cook the tortilla chips with the eggs or chicken they are more mixed. Here they just threw the egg  on top of the chips. The toast was just regular bread nothing special. My food came with green weird sauce . My husband and sons omelette  were ok but nothing special."
Pat's Cafe,"Marisa, happy to hear you enjoyed our service and ambiance. We're sorry to know our dishes didn't leave you with the same impression. In the future, don't hesitate to bring anything up to your server -- it's never a bother to accommodate your dish. Hope you'll come back and see us in the future. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"If traveling and you desire the comfort of a breakfast place similar to your own local breakfast spots, this is your place.  Friendly staff and orders arrive in the right amount of time.  The menu has a bit of something from every genre of food without being so expansive the food isn’t done well.  Highly recommend the eggs benedict and pancakes.  Would definitely visit again."
Pat's Cafe,"Troy, it's wonderful to hear that we could welcome you here. Plus, I'm glad that you enjoyed our carefully picked menu! Great call on the Eggs Benedict, too. They're definitely a favorite around here. Hope we can get a chance to welcome you back. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,We stopped in for breakfast while visiting from Texas. The food was excellent! I recommend the oatmeal and coffee! The service is second to none and the owner goes above and beyond for the people and their 4 legged friends!
Pat's Cafe,Glad you enjoyed our hospitality and thanks for the 5 stars!!
Pat's Cafe,"I don’t get all the good reviews. The food was okay. The service was poor. No water refills, no one asked if food was okay, no jelly for toast. Would not recommend."
Pat's Cafe,"Pat's is hands down my favorite brunch place in San Francisco. It's always a bit crowded, but if you can wait 5-10min for a table I'd suggest to do it. It's totally worth it! My favorite part of the menu are definitely the eggs benedict. I've tried them all and they're all very good (there's an option for every taste). Totally recommend it."
Pat's Cafe,"Adriana, we're so happy to be your favorite! Plus, great call on the Eggs Benedict. It's a popular choice around our place. Looking forward to next time.  - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,By far the best food we had in the 3 days we were in San Francisco. I recommend trying the Belgium waffles with Nutella and Strawberries with real maple syrup. So delicious 😋 …
Pat's Cafe,"Love the 5 stars. Our waffles are the best!!!  Glad you enjoyed,  Pat of Pat’s Csfe"
Pat's Cafe,"Tasty food. If youre hungry you will definitely fill up here. We had the Cali burger and burrito. Service was great as well, Juan took care of us and gave us a little insight on the local area. Artsy atmosphere. Art throughout the cafe on display and for sale! Overall great experience! Will be back. :) maybe try the chicken sandwich next time ..."
Pat's Cafe,"We really love that we get to display work from local artists, Dominick. It really adds flavor to our atmosphere. I'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us! Come back and see us anytime. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"I was lucky enough that Pat’s was one block from my hotel. EXCELLENT service. Great food. If I ever come back To San Francisco … I will stay at the same hotel so I will be close to this place for breakfast. Of course, the hotel is great, too !!"
Pat's Cafe,"Pat's earned an extra star for the quality of service and attention of the staff, I enjoyed the food but my girls hollandaise left something to be desired and the sausage had a freezer burn taste. Otherwise everything was good."
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for the 4 stars.  Sad that you did not enjoy our Hollandaise, hope you will give us another chance."
Pat's Cafe,The restaurant was very busy but the service was great.  My corned beef hash was not like I've ever had before and it was exceptional and VERY tender.  I don't know what else to say except that if I lived here this restaurant would be my regular breakfast place.  Everything about it was spot on! 😋👍 Visiting from Tampa …
Pat's Cafe,Happy to see you on our side of the country! We're thrilled our hash didn't disappoint. Hope to welcome you back the next time you're in San Francisco. -Pat
Pat's Cafe,It was really good.  It's hard for a breakfast place to stand out.  Everybody pretty does the same breakfast menu.  Pats is worth the trip.
Pat's Cafe,"Great service and yummy food! Had the egg croissant sandwich and the pamosa, pomegranate mimosa, both were delicious. Stopped in for breakfast before taking my dad to Alcatraz while he is visiting."
Pat's Cafe,"Ashlea, you certainly can't go wrong with a mimosa before heading out to explore! It's great to see you and your dad could enjoy a delicious meal with us. Hope you'll make your way back over to us soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Decent food. Ordered bagel and lox without capers and still got capers. My sausage links were like warm. Chai latte was great.  When we went to pay the lady at the register couldn’t ring up our meals separately and instead just split it evenly even though we all got different dishes and some of us got drinks and some of us didn’t. The lady said it was just too busy for her to ring up our meals separately.  Cute cafe but mediocre food and disappointing service from the cashier.
Pat's Cafe,"I'm disappointed you weren't pleased with this visit, Maro. It's great you enjoyed the chai latte, but like I mentioned on your Yelp review, I apologize if the order wasn't entirely correct and didn't arrive hot. I'm also sorry that we weren't much help with the bill because how busy we were. Hope you'll be back in the future and give us a chance to win those stars back. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"$$ definitely worth the $$. We had a very attentive waiter, good comfort food. The french toast is fantastic. Cute little san fran breakfast joint. Will definitely go again next trip up there. Coffee was good. My wife loved the latte."
Pat's Cafe,"Glad you see the value of what we offer, Quinton! It's great you were satisfied with our service and the french toast. Hope you and your wife will make your way back in soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,The portions were huge and the food was absolutely delicious.  We took a flyer on this place because it was the first place that popped up on our Google search. BOY DID I PICK A WINNER!! I would come here multiple times if I lived in San Francisco and if I come back I'll DEFINITELY eat here again.
Pat's Cafe,So glad you had such a good experience here at Pat’s we do our best.  We are looking forward to your next visit!!
Pat's Cafe,"My Go-To in the neighborhood whether it's just a coffee on the fly or full breakfast. Can be a little wait on busier weekends because its fairly small in size but nothing like other places.  Good food,  good value, great staff/very accommodating.  Corn beef hash with poached eggs on top is solid. I get it nearly every week."
Pat's Cafe,"Mark, we're glad you had a great time with us and appreciate the stars! Take care till next time. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Great for breakfast!  Tried the Salmon Benedict and highly recommend it.  I can't give the five stars due to very easily fixable annoyances:  #1 Close the front door during the mornings it get the food cold very fast and it makes the experience uncomfortable inside.   #2 For such a nice place, bathrooms need some TLC.  Definitely a place to try when not freezing ouside."
Pat's Cafe,"Julio, we love serving classic dishes with a twist, like our salmon Benedict, and I'm so happy you enjoyed it. I also appreciate your feedback about how we could improve your next visit, and I look forward to it. Until then! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Excellent local breakfast place just outside Fisherman's Wharf, and thus not as tourist-laden as most other breakfast spots in the area. Their breakfast menu is fairly standard, and while not mind-blowing memorable, still pretty darn good, and with lots of kid friendly options. The one thing that I do remember was their coffee. Their coffee was really, really good. I'm a coffee person, I drink my coffee black, no sugar, no milk, and fairly picky, since I don't add anything to the brew to mask the flavor. So if you're staying at the Wharf, and are willing to walk just a few blocks away from the beaten path. I certainly recommend Pat's Cafe"
Pat's Cafe,"Jose, it's great to hear from you, and I'm really pleased to know you loved your visit. Thanks for lettin' us know you enjoyed the breakfast offerings and that the coffee was on point. I really appreciate your support, and I hope you'll make it in again the next time you're in the area.  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Stayed in fishermans wharf for a week, me and my wife both agree this is the best breakfast we had all week."
Pat's Cafe,"I went there with my family of 14 and the wait time was like 2 minutes! Their service is amazing. Very friendly staff and the food was INCREDIBLE!!! Went there for breakfast. Yummy!!! Definitely recommend. Kid friendly. And no long line either, unlike like the ""popular"" place a few blocks away. Give 5 stars but would definitely give 10 stars if I could!"
Pat's Cafe,Super tasty breakfast food with very generous portions. The breakfast burrito was really good. Staff is super friendly and very willing to help find something you can enjoy.
Pat's Cafe,"Fun atmosphere, good place for breakfast."
Pat's Cafe,"It's great that you enjoyed stopping by, Forest! Thanks for your review. We'll see you next time. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We came in from Dallas, TX for the week and glad we found this spot. I had the Belgian waffle loaded with the "" go wild"" ... mmmmm... baybeeeeee.. itvwasbsuper yummy and I ate it ALL. Service was great and I highly recommend."
Pat's Cafe,"Best biscuits and gravy I have had in a long time! The service was friendly and efficient, the food was delicious all around and the location was convenient. It might be my new favorite breakfast spot in the city."
Pat's Cafe,"Sherry, thanks for stopping in for some biscuits and gravy. It's great to see you like our location as well! I hope we'll see you back soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Plenty of breakfast options and great service!
Pat's Cafe,Hole in the wall with excellent service and bigger than expected portions. The Polk Omelette was absolutely delicious and STUFFED. 10/10 would return.
Pat's Cafe,This place has amazing breakfast. The chorizo was the best I've ever had. Service was great as well fast and friendly. 5 stars all day
Pat's Cafe,Thanks for your kind words and glad u liked our good.  Pat of Pat’s cafe
Pat's Cafe,"Cute local place.  Large portions, we could have split it!  Coffee was great and we even got to meet Pat!  Small neighborhood feel, be willing to be friendly with your neighbors, small place but nice staff and quick service even when busy."
Pat's Cafe,"Jaime, it was fantastic having you here! I'm so happy to know you loved our amazing food and friendly service. Hope we can welcome you back soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"We wandered around San Francisco in the Morning and found Pat's Cafe.  It's a cozy little spot.  We were seated very quickly and I zeroed in on the crab cake benidict.  They came with potatoes.  I loved them.  The food was good, the service was good.  The scenery, was amazing."
Pat's Cafe,Good breakfast ! and good location!
Pat's Cafe,"My boyfriend and I did not feel like joining a long line to wait for breakfast in San Francisco last week and remembered seeing a small cafe named Pat's the previous day. We managed to find it again, and were so glad we did. Delicious food and hot coffee, promptly served by friendly staff! The atmosphere is casual and charming. We liked it so much we returned the following morning, ordered different breakfasts and found them equally as well presented and tasty. Will definitely be back if I ever return to San Francisco."
Pat's Cafe,"When I walked up, I remembered the ""under the radar"" part of the description and not the ""colourful"". I'm not sure it can be under the radar if it's bright yellow 😁 but it's easy to find! Great service and home-style cooking. The California Crepé was a good sized meal for 1, and the coffee was descent. Cheers!"
Pat's Cafe,"Brenden, it's great to see you enjoyed our homestyle cooking and friendly service! Thanks for giving us a try! I hope you'll come back next time you're in the neighborhood. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Went for breakfast. Ate outside. Staff was friendly. Food was delicious. Location was nice, not too loud, but it was fun to have the cable cars pass by every few minutes.  Got the veggie hash."
Pat's Cafe,Thanks for your review and we are soooo glad to have the cable cars back - San Francisco charm!!!
Pat's Cafe,The guys are great ! Food was delicious 😋. I had the Mexican chilaquiles.  Not spicy but nice taste a bit bitter but I like that ! Price is unexpectedly low for san francisco. …
Pat's Cafe,"Had to come back and edit my review for Pat. Pat's Cafe is EXACTLY what San Francisco is missing in every single neighborhood. Talk about a place with character, where the staff is friendly and remembers your face, the food is plentiful, the prices affordable, the coffee unlimited. It reminds me of my local diner back home outside of Boston. Pat's is one of the few places in San Francisco that is not void of character, it's homey, it's tasty, it's fantastic, it's special, it's so good that I do not want more people to know about it because I don't want to wait in line. Forget Mama's, this is the spot."
Pat's Cafe,"It's wonderful that you enjoyed stopping by, Andrew! We hope to see you again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,We came here twice. There was no wait so we were seated right away. The server was very friendly. Great overall vibe. The food was quite average; nothing we ordered really stood out. The street this restaurant sits on usually have some empty street cars you can take pictures with.
Pat's Cafe,"Thank you for returning, Jet! Glad the service and atmosphere were to your liking. Sorry to hear our food didn't wow you. Hope you'd come back our way to give our other dishes a try -- I'm confident you'd find something you'd really enjoy. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Very unfortunate food quality for San Francisco.  Simply omelet prices around $14 but quality doesn't support the price.  Tons of chopped onions almost no mushroom or chicken.  This cafe is not for people with disabilities/wheelchairs.  Simply won't get through the door.
Pat's Cafe,"I'm sorry to see you weren't happy with your omelet. I apologize if the content wasn't to your liking, but please know that we use the highest-quality ingredients, and our price reflects that. Plus, our price offers the best value while helps us stay competitive in San Francisco. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but my team and I are always happy to assist our guests. Hope you'll give us another chance to show you what we're really about. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Slightly off the beaten path of Fisherman's Wharf, this was a great breakfast spot. Buzzing with activity and cooking fresh made for a delicious and lively experience. The running sign-in list helps expedite seating and organize traffic, and there is something for everyone on the menu. I did not buy any of the photography on the walls, but there is plenty to look at and enjoy here."
Pat's Cafe,"Thank you for joining us for breakfast, Philip! I'm pleased you enjoyed our freshly made food and lively atmosphere in our cafe. Looking forward to having you back again. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"I live in the neighborhood and come here often despite the popular fancy breakfast places near by. Here you get seated fast, food is good and it feels at-home. Not exactly a 5 star place but i do recommend it. Coffee is high quality, avoid sautéed salmon, go for weekend specials."
Pat's Cafe,"Maria, we're so glad to know you enjoy your visits here! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review, too. I'm glad to know our weekend specials are a favorite! Looking forward to next time you make it our way.  - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Friendly staff and neat location, however got overcooked bacon and butter was missing on pancakes. Was sorted when asked but have to wonder why they thought it was suitable to serve in the first place. Went to use the restroom having not finished my meal and came back to find the table had been cleared, only being gone a minute or two tops. A disappointing experience, staff were friendly and apologetic about the situation though."
Pat's Cafe,"We stayed at the San Remo and were en route to Mel's Diner when we happened upon an older gentlemen whom we asked for public transit help from, and he obliged, he continued the conversation encouraging us to try Pat's. We did that today and WOW. It's a must come set down and eat. Great food, local atmosphere,  excellent service. If you're into local art, this is also a good stop."
Pat's Cafe,"We're so glad you could make it our way during your travels, Mandy! It's wonderful to hear you enjoyed your meal and that we could win you over with a fun time. Hope to see you again soon! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Overpriced place for low quality food. Cheapest sausage in an omelette, raw, but not baked waffles, so so coffee. Stuff is friendly though and pictures on the walls are nice"
Pat's Cafe,Sorry you had a bad experience we do our best and hope you will try us again.
Pat's Cafe,"Aside from sharing a name with this cafe, I believe we also both share a love for delicious breakfasts. I stopped in here on a Saturday morning around 10:30am and was seated almost immediately. During my stay, not 1 but 3 (count em' 3) servers stopped by my table to offer more coffee and to ensure I was enjoying myself. I ordered a large vegetarian omelet with a side of potatoes and toast. The omelet was well prepared, the toast/jam was great, and the coffee was black and strong. The price was more than fair and the location was within walking distance of a number of popular San Francisco destinations. I would highly recommend a early/late-breakfast at Pats."
Pat's Cafe,"There is often a queue to get in and I can see why as the atmosphere alone is really great. Pat herself is there serving people and she is so welcoming and friendly that you don't really notice the time going while you're waiting for a table.  The coffee was good, the food tasted great and there is free wifi."
Pat's Cafe,"Good breakfast. I had the corn beef hash and eggs. It was very good, though little on the small side portion wise. Nice chunks of corned beef. Prices what you expect to pay near tourist areas."
Pat's Cafe,"Tyrone, I'm glad to see you enjoyed your corned beef hash and eggs. A plate of protein and potatoes is a great way to start the day! Thanks for leaving us your review! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,A great breakfast is a short walk up Taylor Street from Fisherman's warf. Pat's service team is also some of the most courteus and attentive that I've had. We'll be back for sure.
Pat's Cafe,"GREAT OATMEAL. They call it ""old fashion"". It's T.H.I.C.K. and hot. Bananas, raisins, I asked for pecans and cinnamon, and they accomadated. The food tastes like someone is really taking pride in its creation. It's tight on space but clean. Compliments from the rest of my group on their breakfasts as well. Highly recommended breakfast spot."
Pat's Cafe,"Whether it's a simple dish or not, we take pride in what we serve, Tracy! I'm so glad you enjoyed everything. Hope to see you back soon! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Found this place on accident when we were too hungry to wait the two hours for the ""famous"" cafe up the street. We got here at just the right time, as the place is small and fills up very fast. I had crab cakes benedict. The hollandaise was supurb. She had french toast made with the best french toast bread. The weekend brunch menu is spectacular, and we even bought some locally made art from the wall. Great spot in a great location!"
Pat's Cafe,"Gregory, it's wonderful to know you had a great time here, and we I really appreciate you taking a moment to share your support for the food and the atmosphere. You're welcome here anytime!  -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Should have taken pic of soggy crepe with cold potatoes.  Of all the places we ate at with fabulous food this w was most disappointing.  Really wanted eggs benedict but that's weekend only.  To order 2 eggs they're 2.99each.  Can't do poached.  Can't do substitutions.  NOT handicap accessible and i barely fit thru door seating my portable oxygen backpack. Other side of front door was locked so i couldn't push that door open to help assist.  Smelled like older home. Don't ask to keep itemized receipt- they'll try to snatch it from you and just give you creditcard receipt. So disappointing.  But went to Hollywood Cafe for a second breakfast and it was fabulous. All i can figure is the rave reviews must be weekends or not honest ones.
Pat's Cafe,"Trish, I want every customer to feel at home here. I'm really sorry your experience with us didn't live up to our great reviews. We should have unlocked the doors to give you easier access to the building. Our food really is delicious, so I hope you'll come back sometime for another try. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Had a great big breakfast at Pat's my first day in San Francisco, it was cozy in there on a chilly morning. The owner was working and talking to customers, which I appreciated. The waiter suggested the chilaquiles and he was right, they were good."
Pat's Cafe,"Pat's Cafe is a sweet spot with a decent sized menu! I have been taking advantage of sitting in the parklet outside during the lockdown, and I hope Pat's is allowed to keep theirs! Try a Mimosa while you're there!"
Pat's Cafe,"Fantastic little spot to enjoy local vibes and great food. Also, excellent service from friendly staff. The hot chocolate with Ghirardelli chocolate!! I’m vegetarian and the San Francisco spinach omelette was terrific, with roast potatoes and sour dough."
Pat's Cafe,"It's wonderful you enjoyed our local atmosphere and our food, Andrew! Glad you enjoyed the SanFrancisco spinach omelet and our hot chocolate. Looking forward to welcoming you back in the future! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Great breakfast spot for well made, tasty food like omelettes, pancakes, French toast, etc. Their fruit & yogurt is wonderful. They always have the best berries. It does get crowded in summer when tourists are more plentiful."
Pat's Cafe,"My wife and I were in San Fran for 7 days we ate at Pat's 4 of them, the food was really  good (get the corn beef hash 😀) we had the pleasure of meeting Pat, very pleasant I must say, she even gave me a little history of the city, all the staff was pleasant as a matter of fact, we really enjoyed our time there. Thanks Pat and staff!!! …"
Pat's Cafe,"Mac, we're so glad you could stop in! Come back our way again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Great experience!!!! So fast (no waitlist, our food came less than 10min after ordering) and amazing food!!! We will come back!"
Pat's Cafe,Great and cozy Italian resturant we were there for breakfast and it was busy but was able to move our table after others have vacated there table. Waiter was very friendly and courteous. Great latte and very authentic.
Pat's Cafe,"Jeremy, starting your day with a delicious latte and a hearty breakfast is the best way! We're thrilled our team took great care of you. We're excited to welcome you again the next time you're in the area. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Food is good, had the Mexican style Chilaquiles. Kids had the French toast and the bread used for them was delicious.  Cost is fair for San Francisco. Nice quiet place to have breakfast."
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for stopping by! I'm so glad to know your family enjoyed your time here. Hope to get to welcome you back sometime, too.  - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"It looks like this business is losing a lot of money. 2 waiters working the bar, inside and outside space. Half of the tables were empty and about 10 people waiting to be seated.  If you actually want to eat, walk a block to the 901 cafe."
Pat's Cafe,"French toast, eggs & a mocha. Good prices, good food."
Pat's Cafe,"Heather, a delicious breakfast at a price you can't beat is the best way to start the day! Happy to hear our coffee was awesome as well. Hope to welcome you again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Stellar corned beef hash, and my wife's Benedict was really good.  One of the reviews said ""pre-made tourist food"".  I was a cook in a similar owner operated breakfast restaurant, and I can say with 100% certainty, that the hash was fresh.  And the crowd appeared entirely local.  Beware of SF reviewers being too cool for the room."
Pat's Cafe,"Though the tables are small and very close together, the food, coffee, and service were perfect!"
Pat's Cafe,Love those 5 stars
Pat's Cafe,Fantastic food & service ! A definite SF Gem:)
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for coming by, Rj! We hope to see you again soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Love places like this. Small and authentic place to have breakfast. Great menu and the quality of the food is outstanding. Highly recommended.
Pat's Cafe,Great food and terrific service. I will definitely be coming back
Pat's Cafe,We stumbled upon Pat’s Cafe several months ago on a vacation to the area. We were happy to find this gem with little to no other outdoor dining breakfast options in the immediate area. We went two days in a row and the food was fantastic!
Pat's Cafe,"It's when you're not looking that you find the best spots, Callie! A great atmosphere and delicious food will draw you in for more. We hope that we can welcome you back the next time you're in San Francisco. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Coffee was replenished quickly, food came fast and the service was top notch. NAiled of the requirement to provide a 5 star breakfast."
Pat's Cafe,"Service was slow, very slow. Took me 15 min of wait for menu, then I stood up and ask for one, otherwise i guess I will be still waiting. Food came cold after another 30 min.  Food was good size, flavor was ok."
Pat's Cafe,Sorry to have read your review and that you experienced bad service. My apologies and the only excuse is that during this COVID period everything’s unpredictable.  Labor costs are high thus less help.  Hope you will forgive us and give us another try.  We really do aim to please!!  Thanks for your comments.  Pat of Pat’s Cafe
Pat's Cafe,the service here was fast. but it's overrated. for the breakfast places we tried in the area it's just diner food.
Pat's Cafe,"Pat's cafe maybe sounds like it might be a British/Irish expat cafe: it is not. Some great California, Mexican breakfast options. Loved Avacodo toast with smoked salmon, Mexican omelette. Great friendly table service."
Pat's Cafe,"Mark, it's wonderful to hear our cafe surprised you with our breakfast options. A slice of avocado toast and an omelette pair perfectly together. We look forward to welcoming you again for another great time. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"I had the Veggie hash. Excellent. Great breakfast. My had the California crepe,, She loved it. Well worth the walk."
Pat's Cafe,"We just finished breakfast and let me tell you-so delish! During the weekends they have really yummy specials, I had the crab cake Benedict! Their hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had! Come here and you won't be disappointed! Pat is a doll too!"
Pat's Cafe,"Good place, good food with big portions but still quite expensive for French people."
Pat's Cafe,Delicious! The food was all the cooked fresh and was very tasty. Drinks were amazing and servers were polite and attentive. Best breakfast in SANFRAN!
Pat's Cafe,"Breakfast was absolutely delicious. Omlet was cooked perfectly, the breakfast potatoes were amazing and crispy, Bloody Mary was on point!"
Pat's Cafe,Happy to see those 5 stars.  Thanks
Pat's Cafe,"We were visiting the city and staying near Fisherman’s Wharf, but didn’t want to do one of the touristy places for breakfast. Friendly staff with quick service and honest to goodness some of the best French Toast I have ever had. Just do yourself a favor and order it."
Pat's Cafe,"You were in the right place, Jaqueline -- thanks for checking us out! I'm glad you enjoyed our french toast and the service. Come visit us anytime you're in the city again. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Absolutely in love with this Cafe! I live in Sioux City IA. But when I take trips to San Francisco, Pat's Cafe is my go to place!!! Fantastic food & espresso, very friendly service & a welcoming atmosphere."
Pat's Cafe,"And we love having you here, Sydney! We're so honored to be your go-to place, and we can't wait to see you during your next visit to town. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,I found Pat's while looking for breakfast near the waterfront. The Mediterranean Crepes and coffee were welcome and filling. The service was prompt and friendly.  Pat's is conveniently close to the Market and Powell cable car line.  I would happily return.
Pat's Cafe,"After three days in SF I found this gem a couple of blocks from our hotel. Great coffee, my children loved the waffles and my wife was very happy with her Chai Latte. Returned the next day for more!"
Pat's Cafe,"Thank you for returning, Giancarlo! I'm so happy to hear you and your family loved what they ordered. Thank you for giving us a try during your time in San Francisco. Hope we'll see you again when you're visiting the city again. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Food was plain and overpriced for what it was (nothing special at all).  GIven the HOUR+ it took just to go from ordering to eating (and they were not even crowded!), I would have much preferred to wait in line and get an awesome breakfast worth waiting for at the nearby Hollywood Cafe which, on the previous day, was outstanding in every regard, from super-fast service to monstrous-sized, beautifully-presented, absolutely delicious meals.  There is always a long line at Hollywood Cafe for a reason;  There are open tables at Pat's for a reason.  We won't go back,nor would we recommend Pat's to anyone based on our experience.  Even if the service had been better, I might have given the place and its food 3 stars - - maybe."
Pat's Cafe,Yummy yummy. Stayed nearby to Pat's. My breakfast was a blue crab omelet with potatoes and sourdough toast. I'm talking very delicious. Will go back there again.
Pat's Cafe,"Lashanda, our blue crab omelette will make your taste buds jump! We're excited you enjoyed every bite of your breakfast. Hoping to have you back whenever you're in the area. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Great food, great service."
Pat's Cafe,"I loved this place. Amazing customer service, very gentle servers. The food is also really good, and it doesn't take that much time to be ready. I'm visiting SF and I'd totally come back next time I'm in town!"
Pat's Cafe,"Great coffee and service. The chilaquiles were awesome,  we shared one cause it is a big plate."
Pat's Cafe,"Getting more popular now, so the place probably will have a line, but it's well worth the wait. Food arrived at a decent time, great for how crowded it was, and oh was the wait worth it. The food at Pat's is phenomenal it and has a great atmosphere. Definitely recommended"
Pat's Cafe,"Nice place to have breakfast.  Usual fayre of eggs, bacon, pancakes etc."
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for your great review, Richard! We're thrilled you had an awesome breakfast with us. Hope you'll make it back our way soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Great cafe and amazing choice of food. We had waffles and pancakes, they were really great."
Pat's Cafe,This is a cute place with great omelets and pancakes. They arent messing around on the portion sizes for pancakes so make sure you're hungry or share as needed.  Great service.
Pat's Cafe,"A hearty plate of pancakes is perfect for breakfast, Cody! Glad you enjoyed everything. Hope to have you back for some more. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"I tried the breakfast before and always delicious so we decided to try the dinner menu the results were excellent barbecue ribs, my husband enjoyed the linguini pasta with shrimp. We highly recommend this place."
Pat's Cafe,"Whether you're in the mood for breakfast or dinner, Martha, whatever you order will be great! Happy to see our ribs and pasta both hit the spot. Looking forward to the next time you make it our way. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Really sweet place, the staff is very nice and are always smiling (but not in a creepy way). Good omelettes and decent salads. Overall a really nice atmosphere and a good breakfast place."
Pat's Cafe,"We're glad to know our team can always welcome you here, Bella! I'm happy to hear you especially like our omelets, too! Thanks for your review  - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Love this place. Planned on visiting many different breakfast places during our trip and ended up coming back to Pat's Cafe every morning instead! Great service and even better food. Cant wait to come back to SF just to visit Pat's again.
Pat's Cafe,"Thanks for the love, Alex! I'm thrilled you guys came back for our service and food. You've got a place to enjoy breakfast anytime you're in San Francisco. See you next time! - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Breakfast was perfect, outdoor dining presented exceptionally well and service was great.  The waiter went out of his way to make it a delightful meal."
Pat's Cafe,"Glad you could join us for a delicious breakfast, Jan -- it's the best way to start the day! It's wonderful to see our staff made your visit extra memorable. Hope to welcome you again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"The potatoes are amazing. The California crepe is super good. Wonderful service at good prices.  If you want/need a straightforward breakfast, this is the place to go."
Pat's Cafe,"Pedro, glad our potatoes and California crepe were both to your liking! Flavorful American breakfast is what we're all about, and I'm happy you left with a great impression. Hope you'll join us again soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"I definitely will! Coming from Connecticut it won't be any time soon unfortunately.  Had a great breakfast, me and my girls enjoyed it."
Pat's Cafe,We're really happy you had a great visit! Be sure to come see us the next time you're around. -Pat
Pat's Cafe,Such amazing people… incredibly wonderful food…. great little place off the beaten path do yourself a take favor and take a trip..
Pat's Cafe,Great service and delicious food
Pat's Cafe,This is a great place to wake up to. Hash and eggs were fantastic. Eggs Benedict options are amazing. We will see you again soon.
Pat's Cafe,First time visiting. I really wanted to like the place because it had great reviews. I ordered the Mexican chilaquiles and there was no flavor. I was disappointed. Also no kids menu so that was another disappointment. And last they automatically charge the tip.
Pat's Cafe,"D, thanks for giving us a try. I'm disappointed you didn't enjoy your chilaquiles -- you should expect it to be plenty flavorful. I hope you'll come back again to give us a chance to show you what we're really made of. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Fantastic breakfast, the outside was cold but inviting. All fresh food cooked to order. Medium to long wait for delicious food."
Pat's Cafe,"While you're still standing in line at Mama's, I'm finishing off my Eggs Benedict.  And Pat knows hollandaise sauce (even better than Bo).  Great neighborhood spot, although you'll be sharing with the tourists (they're wearing shorts, easy to spot, and shouldn't bite unless provoked).  Nice jazz selections on Sun and options for big or small groups.  Clearly, this ain't Pat's first rodeo."
Pat's Cafe,"Went on Monday (veterans day observed) bc I wanted to treat myself to Benedict on my birthday. Unfortunately, Benedict is only on weekends so I had to settle for an omelette. Great variety of breakfast options though. Live in the neighborhood so will have to come back for the benny."
Pat's Cafe,"Hey, neighbor! We really appreciate you stopping in for a bite, Olivia. Can't wait to hear what you think of our Benedict. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Great food. Great service. Fabulous breakfast place with lots of variety. Easy walk from fisherman’s wharf.
Pat's Cafe,Great food and staff!
Pat's Cafe,Friendly staff and food came out rather quickly. The bagel with butter and jam was great
Pat's Cafe,"So glad we stopped here! Looks like a small little random cafe, but well worth the visit. Food was very good. Breakfast burrito is a must try !"
Pat's Cafe,"Katelynn, happy you found our gem of a place while exploring the city! You can't go wrong with our tasty breakfast burritos. Hope to welcome you again sometime soon. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Good breakfast food for a really low price. Large pancake serving with side for less than $10! Great service. Had a small mistake with my order one time but they more than made up for it.
Pat's Cafe,"Wife and I had breakfast. Good portions, reasonably priced, quality service. Chef's egg cooking level: expert. We enjoyed our time. Recommend."
Pat's Cafe,The food was just ok nothing significant for the prices. The staff seemed annoyed that they had to serve us. Made the whole experience negative and unwelcoming. OJ was not fresh squeezed and tasted like it was frozen from a can.
Pat's Cafe,"David, we're bummed to see you our breakfast didn't leave you with a lasting impression. Please know this kind of feedback isn't typical of our team. Nevertheless, we'll discuss internally to ensure all our patrons are receiving the same level of service. All that said, hope you'll give us another chance to better impress you. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"If you would like a homecooked meal without actually having to cook it, then come to this hole in the wall call Pat's. I had the Californian omelette which taste just like home. Their side of potatoes are seasoned to perfection, not salty but not too bland. just right. The sourdough bread is always a plus of course."
Pat's Cafe,Tried on a whim with 3-13 year olds for breakfast. Absolutely fantastic breakfast omelets and pancakes. The staff was attentive and pleasant. We would definately come back.
Pat's Cafe,"Carolyn, feeding a pack of 13-year olds can be a daunting challenge, so I'm glad we could help get the job done! We'll be glad to have you back anytime you're in the area. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Cute place. Nearby. But everything was cold. Gravy on the biscuit, cold. Eggs, scrambled or sunny-side, cold. Service was good. Food disappointing"
Pat's Cafe,"pancakes not good at all , took a crepe also veggies and chicken and it was plain basic with no taste and lacked salt and flavor. wont come back as there are far better places to brunch out in chestnut or north beach !!"
Pat's Cafe,"My boyfriend and I always start our day at Pat's when in the City.  Relaxed environment, great coffee and wonderful food.  The servers are on it and super nice as well."
Pat's Cafe,"Gabriela, happy to hear our dishes always bring you and your boyfriend joy! It makes us smile to know our breakfast spot is a favorite of yours. We can't wait to be able to welcome you both again in the future. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"I love this place! It is my favorite local breakfast spot! The staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! It was even featured in a famous novel!"
Pat's Cafe,"I'm thrilled you love to have your breakfast here, Caleb! It's great you always enjoy the food and our friendly service. Thanks for being a fan -- see you next time! - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,The faint scent of puke permiates this restaurant. If that's not enough to turn you off the food is edible but that's the best that can be said. At least they frequently don't pick up the phone for to go orders and get your order wrong more often than you would think possible. Much better options are nearby.
Pat's Cafe,"Sorry our food and service didn't meet your expectations, Jeremy. It's sad you didn't like our food and felt uncomfortable dining in. Our team cleans the place thoroughly, and we've never had similar complaint. Sorry if we missed the mark on your order before, but we do our best to answer our phone during busier hours. I hope you'd give us another try to show you what we can do best. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,The tables were very close to each other. Good food. Very loud. But fun!!
Pat's Cafe,Delicious food at a good price! Had the eggs Benedict and they were perfect! Will definitely return next time I'm in town

Pat's Cafe,"I eat at Pat's every time I am in town.  Service is always fantastic, food is great, and usually no wait to get a table.  Pancakes are delicious."
Pat's Cafe,"Gary, pancakes are a must when you're visiting! Happy to always leave you impressed with our service and cuisine. Looking forward to your next trip in town. -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"After more than a few years we revisited Pat's. We went way out of our way to get there. The place has either been sold off or subjected to absentee owners. Decor cute, food 'Eggs and potatoish' and sadly service indifferent. If you want to run a neighborhood nook start acting like a neighbor."
Pat's Cafe,"Michael, I'm disappointed to hear that your latest visit wasn't what you'd hoped. We always want everyone to feel welcome and I'll be following up with my team to see what may have been the case here. I appreciate you coming out of your way to stop by, and I hope you can give us another chance to remind you why you had such a wonderful time here.  - Pat"

Pat's Cafe,"Scott, I'm glad we're on the list of must-visit places in San Francisco! It warms my heart to see you enjoy my food. I hope you'll come back soon! -Pat"
Pat's Cafe,"Well worth the wait to eat here, reluctant to say so because the it may make the wait longer. Fresh and flavorful.  I recommend you down to Denny's and leave this place to the locals"
Pat's Cafe,"John, we're thrilled that you're a fan! Hoping you'll be back our way again soon. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Great breakfast spot. Be prepared to wait a bit of you go on the weekend. We had salmon bennies and a Cali omelette. Delish. $44 including tip.

Pat's Cafe,Great tasting food for the price. The place is clean and great service
Pat's Cafe,"The food was bomb, the service was horrendous. We sat for about 15 mins without anyone addressing our table. I had to get up and go ask. Got attitude about it. Server who took our order never came back to check so another server came and refilled our drinks. Yeah service was CRAPPY."
Pat's Cafe,"I'm glad the food was delicious, Alexandra, but I'm sorry you were taken care of promptly by our team -- you should never have to ask for help no matter how busy we get. I hope you'd give us another chance to prove to you what we can do best. - Pat"

Pat's Cafe,"This is just not good food,  we went there for breakfast and it was just awful. The chilaquiles were cold (like they just poured the sauce straight out of the fridge, the house scramble was teastlea. a very bad choice if you are looking for good food"
Pat's Cafe,"Sorry our food wasn't to your liking, Argelia. Our team works hard to serve delicious food that we're known for, but it's disappointing that we didn't quite meet your expectations. You're welcome to let your server know if you're not entirely satisfied with your food at the moment. Hope you'd give us another try and see what we're really about. - Pat"
Pat's Cafe,Superb breakfast! Would recommend to anyone visiting this part of SF
Pat's Cafe,"French Toast was not toast but old baguette slices. Omelette was okay, but not as good as in other breakfast restaurants over San Francisco. Prices are higher and portions smaller than in comparable restaurants. Would not come back again."
Pat's Cafe,"Quintessential American Cafe, great service, great food.  Loved my Omelette."
Pat's Cafe,"The waiter forgot to place our order, then apologized and offered free juice and a small discount.  Forgiven.  Then the ""over-medium"" eggs arrived as a puddle.  Nice folks, but not a good effort."
Pat's Cafe,Pat's cafe is real comfort food! We had the granola and banana pancakes which were great and I hate bananas!! Everything was great and there was NO wait definitely give it a try!!
Pat's Cafe,"Really good food. The sauce is perfect. All the staff are extremely friendly, and the owner is very open and friendly to all the clients. It really is like eating at home."

Pat's Cafe,"While visiting the city recently, our place was just around the corner.  The food here is great. Even with all of the choices available, we will be going back to Pat's again on this visit."

Pat's Cafe,Good food served quickly 😋
Pat's Cafe,"It was not as clean as it should have been.  Sticky chairs and tables.    Creamer had been on the table quite a while, community condiments,  we could tell that someone licked the spoon that was in the jam/jelly."
Pat's Cafe,Breakfast was top notch. Love finding great little places here and there that always surprise us with down home food
Pat's Cafe,"Wendy, it's great to see you're a fan of our cozy little spot! We're delighted our breakfast hit the spot. Hope to welcome you again the next time you're in the area. -Pat"

Pat's Cafe,"Smoked salmon eggs benedict, sourdough fresh toast! Yum. Very friendly & good service."

Pat's Cafe,Portions are large and taste good. We came here 3 of the 4 days we were in SF and it was a great decision.

Pat's Cafe,"Cold food, old coffee, 15 min wait on the waitress to take your order, 20 min to get the food, the bathroom/office was dirty. The food was expensive 30 for one person"

Pat's Cafe,"I went to eat breakfast. The color of the exterior is very cute and it is a fashionable cafe. The walls were decorated with paintings and were for sale. I was fascinated by the brightly colored store that made me feel Mexican. For breakfast, I ordered sandwiches, coffee, French toast, and hot cakes. The sandwich bread was crispy and the vegetables inside were fresh and delicious. French toast and hot cakes are also fluffy, and of course the taste is the best. The coffee cup was a pats cafe original cup and it was very cute. Please come to San Francisco Please stop by. Staff service was also good."

Pat's Cafe,"A long wait... But how good is it! I could eat there every Sunday! I don't know what else to tell you. A listening team always smiling and joking!

Pat's Cafe,Perfect breakfast! Appropriate price and tasty food!
Pat's Cafe,"There were four of us in Pat's Cafe and we were already around 7:45, when it was not yet full. When we were done eating, there was already a small line forming outside. The condition was super friendly. As usual in America, the coffee was refilled very attentively for free. I had 3 pancakes. There was still maple syrup and jam on the table. I'm really a good eater and was really stuffed after the three very tasty, freshly made and fluffy pancakes - 2 would have done it. For $2 you could have chosen one of different toppings. The other dishes were also plentiful, tasty and fresh. In the end, four of us paid $70 including tip, which is definitely justified given the great service and the very tasty breakfast. I will come back."
Pat's Cafe,"Paul, I'm really happy you had a great time here, and I want to thank you for choosing us as your spot for breakfast. I really appreciate your support, and I hope you'll stop back again the next time you're in the area.  -Pat"
