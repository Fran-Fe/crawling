SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"+1 for environmental friendliness with provision of compostable utensils/containers +1 for quick prep +1 friendly staff  However, the presentation was lacking. I was definitely expecting something more exciting out of the smoke & mirrors drink, which ended up being just that - smoke and mirrors. Edible gold dust? Didn’t see it in the drink. The sandwich looked pretty vanilla. The taste was also lacking. The pulled pork sandwich tasted more like a school cafeteria sloppy joe (you may be into that but I wasn’t). The coffee had an interesting floral flavor but I’m not sure it would really be anyone’s “go to” drink. But that’s just me.  Would have given 4/5 but the price points at $7 for a drink and $11 for pulled pork sandwich leaves a slight bitter taste in my palate and leaves me feeling that I didn’t get the best foodie ROI. Also, not sure I get a lot of experimental “lab” out of the textures/tastes/presentation."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I found this place on Yelp looking for a coffee shop walkable from chase center and I’m glad I did!!  I got the mardi gras cold brew-bomb! My friend got the Island Hop- ube/coconut flavors(which I tried). If you do not like those flavors , don’t get that drink because flavors are strong. But they have a good selection of coffee/teas on their menu. I absolutely recommend this place!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,July 2022: Tried the roast beef sandwich and a veggie sandwich. Both were really good. I thought the veggie sandwich was really unique and delicious!  The bread 🍞 is really good for sandwiches. Nice and light.  People come here for the coffee drinks but I think people should come back for the sandwiches 🥪!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,I loved the vibe and this place has exceptional coffee and food. Must visit!!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I love SPRO so much! I come here every time I go to SF (one day Spark Social was closed for a private event, and I was heartbroken). Baristas here treat all guests like friends and everything on their food and coffee menus (and also on a secret menu) is nothing less than amazing and wonderful! If you don't know what coffee to get, try Coco de Mer or Orange Blossom"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Rich and his team are amazing. The moment I sipped the Coco de Mer, it was love. Dark chocolate, coconut, and coffee?! Come on. I hate overly syrupy drinks and am a habitual black coffee drinker but this was definitely worth the foray. Order food here, it ensure you're back the next day for more."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Beautiful presentation as well as tastes good (especially coming from a food truck)! Located in Spark Social, Spro has a delicious brunch/breakfast/small bites menu :) I had the Southern Bell (red velvet waffles), the Umami Bomb (avocado toast), and the Farmer's Market!  Would definitely recommend the Umami Bomb!!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Honey is not vegan. Please update your menu to correctly label items.  If you offer a vegan alternative, it should be listed as “vegan option available” instead of straight up labelled as vegan."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Ellie, we have agave as a substitute as vegan alternative. We have vegan options available, you just have to ask! 😄"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"The establishment has a very limited / nearly no selection of vegan items and, unfortunately charges extra for vegan milk (but not less if you want to make the single dish available — umami bomb —, vegan).  It does call out vegan items on the menu, which is appreciated."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Shelly, the price for our umami bomb is set and not up for negotiation. If you want to take out the ikura salmon roe, it will not reduce the price. Similarly if you eat at a restaurant, asking the restaurant to take out the ingredient doesn't make the menu cheaper. I hope you find better luck elsewhere.  Additionally, we have vegan burgers, almond butter toast, sandwiches that can be vegan including vegan buns. We are not a vegan restaurant but will accommodate as best as we can. Leaving a poor review because we didn't have enough options or because the pricing wasn't to your liking doesn't reflect on our high standards and quality of food. We stand firmly behind our menu, regardless of harassment."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"At 8am, there were quite a bit of people there (three were waiting for their order and two were in front of us in line). I called them 30min ahead for the pickup order but still had to wait 15 minutes before they had my order ready. I picked up coco de mer and a strawberry guava pillow. My friends got a few brown butter chocolate sea salt cookies to share.The drink was definitely on the bitter side and quite rich. Not sure if they omitted the condensed milk too since I chose the oat milk option... The pastries were definitely the stars of the show. The pillow had just the right amount of tart and it felt like a warm embrace but with buttery crunchy texture. The cookie was sweet but balanced out with the sea salt. Super buttery as well. If I do swing by again, will be trying other pastries for sure and maybe a different drink."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Was at Spark in SF and tried their coffee. I ordered a Island Ube or something like that and it was extraordinary.  It doesn't taste artificial at all so I assume they must use real ube. The espresso itself was quite flavorful and intense with the ube added sure brought out a different experience.  Loved it.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"It was my first time going there and I didn't have time to ask about they're story, but it's a curious food truck. They make delicious coffee and food. The food didn't seem to match the coffee part (to me) which is why I'll ask next time. I had yummiest crab cake with spicy sauce and my husband had a perfectly prepared espresso. I look forward to my next visit!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I've ordered from here for delivery over 5 times since October! This strawberry guava pillow pastry is super tasty and unique. I love their mocha - one of my favorites in the city, despite being a bit pricey."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Can't believe this place has so few reviews! The red velvet latte is SO good. This area is super cool, with tons of food trucks, and a double decker bus you can eat in! Easy walk from muni too."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Have you ever had a gibby?  I stopped by because I was looking for a decent espresso and my friends from UCSF suggested going by the Starbucks here near mission bay.  After watching a few other people order ahead of me I took a chance and copied what they had done.  Highly recommended!   No sugar needed.  Exactly what the doctor ordered and totally hit the spot.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,I love their toasts and all their savory bites. The non alcoholic drinks are just the perfect refreshments for hot weather! Try their Sangria and umami bomb toast!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I am so glad I came across SPRO. If you are in mission bay this is a must! So far, this is the best coffee I’ve had in the area.  The 5 stars is based off of the service and coffee only as I have not had the food.  I usually order the Mardi•gras. If you like strong coffee, I would highly recommend this. It’s a cold brew coffee. It’s rich in flavor, strong, and a subtle sweetness to it.  The staff is great. Super friendly and easy to talk to.  The cherry on top, is that SPRO is located inside of spark social. If you’re unfamiliar, spark social is a food truck park with picnic tables, fireplaces, unique decor, board games etc...  Something to note, they actually open at 7am on weekdays and 8am in weekends. I wish I knew this earlier, but so glad I know this now :)"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Amazing coffee, possibly the best in the city. Staff is super nice as well."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Definitely enjoyed this unexpected stop on a bike ride down the water... in addition to their “secret” black swan cappuccino, ask for their “umami” toast which is a vegan alternative to their lox + avo. Unique, aesthetically beautiful, and delicious."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Great coffee complimented by a bunch of delicious small café bites. Plus excellent music and super chill surroundings at the food park.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,I tried the Pixie Dust coffee and the cinnamon cookies and I loved them!!! So delicious 🤤 The staff is super friendly too ☺️ …
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Our absolute favorite spot. Great food and drinks. Not a single item that we didn't like.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Fanciest lattes in SF!! I love the Tea Thyme and butter croissant.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"$8 coffee... nuff said.  [EDIT: owner posted a pretty agro response. I'm adding a photo of the menu -- they cover the prices with tape. So you wait 15 mins, get to the front, order, and... then discover you're in it $8.75 for an iced coffee. Also weirdly both in-person and again in ""Response from the owner"" they recommended going to Starbucks instead. Idk boutique coffee feels like it should be a positive experience.]"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Attacking a small business on how much they charge in a city with the highest rent in the country. We shouldn't have to explain how our trailer has higher rent than any apartment in San Francisco. But we shouldn't have to teach you economics. You'll find green apron wearing cheaper coffee conglomerates a block away.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Get the food here, it's good. I ordered the SPRO burger, which was ~very~ fresh, and the flavors were vibrant. The meat was springy and tasty, the bread was soft and comforting. I was missing fries with my meal at first (which isn't included, it isn't offered if I'm not mistaken) but then I quickly forgot about it and just enjoyed the food. I also ordered an iced coffee drink, the cold fashioned, which was not bad, but not my favorite. It didn't particularly go with my burger, so I decided to have burger over coffee, that's how good the burger was. One potential drawback: the wait. And wait and wait and wait. Waited over 30 minutes for our order of 3 entrees and 2 drinks. But I quickly forgot about it once I was biting into my food. Go there. Get it."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"SPRO is one of my favorite coffee places on earth. The coffee and tea drinks are phenomenal. Try the Cat’s Pajamas, Geisha, Orange Blossom. The overnight oats are absolutely heavenly - try them hot!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Some of the best pourover coffee I have ever had. There's a wide selection of coffee/non-coffee beverages.  It's one of the permanent food trucks inside the SparkSocial park. Great place to grab a beverage and then wander the food trucks for a bite to eat.  Update: This place has become a brunch tradition for me. The pour over blend includes anaerobically processed beans which gives the coffee an almost berry-like aroma. The fennel sausage is delicious and makes for a filling brunch with toast and eggs.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Ube coffee - like Whaaaa? I can't even imagine what that would be like so obviously I had to try it! And OMG it works! I don't know what alchemy went on behind the scenes but the flavor was outstanding ! I then tried the pixie dust - which has a whole host of flavors that sound exactly like the name suggests. The coffee had orange peels in it. Sounds weird ? But tastes phenomenal ! I don't know how but they do and that's the magic of their coffee. I am yet to try all their flavors ( I'm dying to try th activated charcoal one)  Hands down one of the most unique coffee places I've been to including that one place in Denver that I had a chagachino - chaga mushrooms or some thing ? That was great too!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I was in SF for two weeks for work, and was so glad to find this food truck with amazing coffee and healthy breakfast food options a short walk from the Mission Bay UCSF campus. The oat milk lattes were phenomenal, the food was high quality and the service was incredible. By the end of the two week period I was on a first-name basis with the co-ower, Liza, who remembered my order pretty much to the T every morning I called in ahead for pickup! The fact that a food truck offers perfectly cooked sous-vide eggs was such a pleasant surprise. Also the hot overnight oats and blueberry waffles were incredible. Can't recommend this place enough!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Hands down the best coffee and service in San Francisco. This place is so good and has such unique but tasty coffee recipes. They have excellent service. I’ve never been disappointed by Spro coffee lab
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Perhaps the best coffee I’ve ever had
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,A bit longer of a wait than normal yesterday morning but the same lovely food and coffee as always. Missed this place once the pandemic started.  Highly recommend the Mash-Up for those that want a nice twist on the traditional eggs on toast.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"SPRO is just the best. Spark social is such a great place to come and hang out, but even better is to spot an unsuspecting surprise of a shop. The staff are kind, astute, and helpful. Not only are the prices a bargain for the high quality ingredients, but the food is fantastic! I don't think I've had such great food at a coffee shop, yet they manage to maintain high quality products consistently. Being a regular here really draws from these things, and I'd easily say it's the best shop in San Francisco!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Try blue bottle right infront better usual coffee varieties. SPRO is only good if you are trying one of their custom drinks.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"A really great place for some extraordinary coffee made by great people who have an incredible passion for what they're doing.  Definitely try their coffee cocktails for a new take on your favorite drink.  The Cold Fashioned and their version of Japanese matcha green tea are highly recommended.  Check them out if you're in the Bay area, it'll be worth it."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Don't let the coffee truck aspect fool you! This place serves a great selection of lattes, pour overs, and non-coffee options. I love their elder flower cold brew as well as the orange blossom latte, I know it sounds weird but it actually works really well.  P. S. They also offer a 10% discount to UCSF employees so don't forget your badge!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Why aren't you already here? Phenomenal tasty coffee, and really good food. Makes the NY'r side of me cry over the nostalgia of good cafe food."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Excellent espresso drinks and tasty breakfast treats make this a great option for your morning coffee and sweet breakfast. I'm sure they have savory options as well, but when you are standing at the counter and you see their cookies or pancakes or waffles, it's hard to imagine ordering anything else!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Saw the amazing video of Rich hunting down that car. I also see the website needs work (like no SSL for example). Would love to do a project free of charge. Love owners that stick up for their workers ~Cohen Web Design, Binghamton NY"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I just spent $8 on a single slice of toast. It has almond butter and berry jam on it. Yummy but not $8 worth of yummy. When I saw the price I was expecting maybe a good hearty couple slices of bread but no... One slice. One. Single. Slice. Cut diagonally. One slice. Really?! Wow! Don't get the almond toast guys, it's so very not worth the $$$.  Cost of living in SF and paying enough for people who serve you to live near here, trust me I get it and I support it within reason, hence why I came here rather than stop at Safeway for a quick bite, but putting ONE slice of bread (that constitutes as maybe a side item, or a snack, not a meal) in a toaster and then slathering on some almond butter and jam takes someone *maybe* 3 minutes to do.  Advice to you if you're eating at this food truck, get something for a couple bucks more that has more of a meal quality to it. This is ridiculous, what should be a lovely experience in my city has turned into a sour one."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Emily,  Thanks for your feedback and we're sorry to hear that you did not enjoy our price point. We value quality over quantity. Our bread is freshly baked by our rather than purchased from a grocery store. We make our own triple berry jam, marcona almond butter, then top it off with French maldon sea salt. We're in the business of making food taste great, not cheap. If we can get our products from Safeway and serve them to our guests, we'd rather not be in business. Like everyone else in this San Francisco, we have high rent and jobs to support the higher cost of living. Hopefully you can understand our perspective and your experience in the city will improve.  Rich"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,I ordered the gibby but didn't like it because it was sour.  The guy who took my order appeared prejudiced.  It was an outside  atmosphere with good music.  Coming from Oakland I believe I'd rather stick closer to downtown.  It's located with other trucks and may be a nice space for group fun.  Prices range from $$-$$$.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Such a great place for coffee in the mornings on your way to work. by no means am I a coffee drinker but I definitely enjoy the cup that I had here. For those of you who also like milk in your coffee I definitely did not feel judged at this coffee lovers coffee shop.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"We've been here 6 or 7 times, the coffee is good, the food is good, but the wait is mind-blowing. Every time we go here, there are about 5 or 6 people in line, which is totally fine, it's the morning, I get it. But it takes about 20 minutes to get through the line to order, and then another 20-30 minutes to actually receive a coffee or two. I love the outdoor space and the vibes, but I'm really over the 30-50 minute total wait for coffee. It's a shame, this place is nice and the staff are really nice. :(  As for the Finca Kilimanjaro, I don't think it was worth the $8. It was a little bland for my taste, I prefer the Sipacapa after comparing the two. But, if I hadn't tried it I wouldn't have known. :)"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Kelsey, Hopefully you can provide us with some feedback to improve our service? I believe you had ordered a Finca Kilimanjaro. Did you not enjoy it? Finca coffees are a world recognized prized coffee, we'd like to make you another cup if that wasn't to your expectations. We also have a lengthier process to quality control and monitor the way the coffee brews, freshly made pourovers are usually 6-8 minutes long from start to finish. We hope that the wait was not too long, we move as quickly as we can, so we can focus on a higher quality product. Please let us know what we could work on, our very passionate crew would love to keep working hard at delivering our best. Thanks for understanding. -Rich"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"SPRO has all the makings of the happiest morning and mid-day you need. Their drink selection is exciting. Small bites and snacks are exactly what you’re looking for and their service is spot on. Bravo SPRO, we love you guys!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Lots of great food trucks to choose from after vigorous round of miniature golf. Plenty of good seating for mix of weather too
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"We waited a while for our order, and when they finally called out my name they brought out two items, only one of which was mine. I asked for clarification and the employee was rude. Also, the salmon sandwich was extremely expensive for what it was; I've ordered the same thing (but with more salmon) at Gus' down the street for less than half the price. My chicken teriyaki (daily special) was tasty, but also quite expensive. Overall disappointed with the experience."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Wendy, sorry to see that you weren't completely satisfied. Could you let us know how we can improve to make your experience better?"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,My husband ordered me a drink knowing I cannot have sugar. The drink description made no mention of having sugar in it.  There is tons of sugar in The drink.  Shame on you for not disclosing your ingredients.  This is a health issue for many (including myself) and is it really that difficult to include?  I don’t think so.   Huge fail and I will not be getting anything here again.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi there, sorry this happened. All of our drinks lists clearly the sweeteners. We do not use syrups or cane sugar and use only natural ingredients. Perhaps he misunderstood the ingredients? Could you please let us know what drink he ordered?  If you have a health issue, it would be best if you disclose them so the food and beverages can be properly prepared. A safe suggestion for your husband if he orders for you, instead of ordering our mocktails, order a cold brew."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,This is by far the best coffee shop in mission bay. Possibly SF err California. There aren’t a more talented or kind staff in all of cafe history. Everything is done with consideration and meaning but within the powers of magician baristas. This coffee truck has an aesthetic of simple but powerful. Your tips are worth the investment in such amazing baristas and coffee.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"LOOOOOVE it. Well crafted espresso and the added water rinse/blueberries sent it over the top. Plus the design at the bottom of the cup felt like a little present. Also, really enjoyed my time with Riesling 🐶  – thanks, I'll be back …"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Best coffee I've had in SF, which puts it in the running for best coffee worldwide.  I've lived here since 2007, through all the coffee wars initiated by Blue Bottle, then Four Barrel, Sightglass, etc.  Some say there's a really serious coffee scene in Japan, now, but haven't been recently to compare."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"1. Wait time was too long for a small coffee. My friend had to wait 15 min for a cold coffee. 2. Did'nt have a choice for light/medium/dark roast coffee, only one kind of 'pour over' 3. Coffee was okay but close to 4 bucks for a small coffee after waiting for 10 minutes was not worth it. Bit on the expensive side especially when you are not offerring different roasts and flavors. Sorry for a negative review."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Sorry to see your experience wasn't perfect. Hope you can provide some feedback as how we can provide a better experience for you for next time.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Thanks to the awesome barista (you rock girl!) I had the best flat white! I went to Spro last Monday but I also went back the day after. Looks like I’m a new regular at this coffee shop!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Employees are so nice. The coffee is amazing. You can really tell they make sure everything tastes good before they serve your drink. The food always surprises me.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"In a sea of snobby craft coffee shops that only serve standard coffee & espresso fare, SPRO is a massive breath of fresh air! Sometimes homegirl just wants an outrageous, over-the-top flavored latte, OK?!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Good food and good matcha! Previously had their umami bomb toast and it was amazing! Truly an umami party in your mouth! This time had their special vegan bolognese spaghetti and it was excellent! Surprising deliciousness from a “coffee shop”!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,The Orange Blossom latte is amazing and the coffee cake was delicious!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"For every Starbucks and $5 latte on every block, you can't go wrong with a place that makes you feel like your money is going to the right place. After a cheerful conversation with the barista at this coffee shop truck, I spotted my eye on the coco de mer, coconut and condensed milk, tcho chocolate, somehome I picked the most popular, and I can see why! You know a cup of coffee is good when it leaves a thick ring of foam around the cup as you drink it. You'd be suprised with the charm a little truck has to offer. Can't go wrong! 10/10"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I really like spro, yes they have drinks, but the food is where it is at especially their specials. They used to have a lot of Asian fusion specials, but these days it's pretty normal boring American food stuff not really too excited about that, keeps me from going as often."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"I have come to this place for the third time today and I have not been able to eat the hokkaido crepe cake. I went there right (Saturday)when they open and they said it's all sold out. How is that even possible???? I went there (Sunday)in the afternoon the second time and they told me the same thing that it is sold out. I went there specifically to eat the hokkaido crepe cake but I have not been able to even see it. I went there today(Friday) again during lunch time and again I heard the same thing that it's sold out. They say there is a limited amount of the cake but when I went the first time when it open, they say it's sold out. Is that even an excuse??? On their menu if something is sold out they would put a tape saying sold out next to the item but there was no tape seen next to the line saying hokkaido crepe cake. This is just lying to customers saying they have it but never being able to even see it."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Yuen, it's a popular cake and only made in small quantities. While we would love to have the cake available anytime, it can difficult to supply when we do not make it. In the meantime, we have an amazing pastry chef onsite. Her creations are tremendously popular, a classic French creme bruleé and an incredible New Orleans style bread pudding. It's not to be missed!! If you're only looking for the crepe cake, we hope you have better luck again in the future. Please remember to come early on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays! Cheers! =)"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Been coming here since they opened. Amazing drinks, food and staff. Always consistent in food and service. They offer a unique drink selection and quality food menu inspired by the wonderful owners."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Just saw a video on YouTube of the owner of this businesa Chasing down a thief that stole one of his employees cars. This is the kind of business that deserves your support
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Variety coffee (mind that I’d say their beans are of an acquired taste), and variety of breakfast / brunch options. Always open. Great spot to chill out"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,These coffee drinks are so good. Interesting variety of different inspirations and flavors. Nice to get a hot drink and chill in one of the swings!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Great coffee and tasty food in a great open air environment
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Love coming here, being outside at the spark social and enjoying a delicious SPRO coffee! They have so many fancy and yummy flavors to choose from!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Very interesting coffee cocktails. it's basically a alcoholic cocktail, but with caffeine instead of booze. Equally interesting."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Eventually I will try all of their drinks~ my fav now is fifty shade and orange latte and the cakes. Delicious ~ yummy yum ~~
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,The Iced matcha latte is good but not special. The cookie pb&j sandwich really tastes better than expected.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,This place is the bees knees. Coffee drinks are perfectly made and inventive and the food is really well made. Looks like someone really put thought and love into this little food truck.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Liked the pour overs here. Good single origin light blend grains.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Really great place, even with small kids! There is a large, out of service truck, that our 4 year olds played on for over an hour! Not to mention yummy food and drinks!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,So much more than coffee!  The food is excellent.  Definitely get the grilled cheese sandwich.  Highly recommended!

SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"saw an epic video where rich trailed a car thief in the city, you're obviously going to get amazing service here"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Probably the best green tea I've ever had. The coffee lab makes some unique coffee, but they also take tea seriously"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Perfect morning coffee place with delicious bites, almost always beautiful weather in Mission Bay to sit outside & enjoy with your dog"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Owner chased down a car thief and got the car back.  5/5  Coffee's good too.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,The man with the red tesla that saved your bakers car is a champion!!! Good job!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Tasty coffee drinks, but sometimes service is really slow for taking orders and serving the drinks. Also it's pretty expensive for food truck coffee."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Super awesome selection of coffee and tea drinks, my go-to spot to grab something when at 4th and King Caltrain stop"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Better than blue bottle, and their food menu is top notch."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Large variety of amazing espresso drinks. Spice island and red velvet never disappoint.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Well crafted expressos! Coco de mer is one of my favorite drinks here. A tad bit expensive!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Inventive coffee concoctions with wonderfully personal staff. Cold fashioned and Fifty Shades are the front runner.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Kind people here let me take my coffee even though my card was declined. When I sort that I will be back to spend some $
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Coffee so good I put their pin on my backpack. That's coming from someone who has un-ironically tried using the BeanHunter app.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Nice
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Really good quality food and drink. It's amazing that they can cook like that out of a shack. Delicious!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Food is really good, love the mash up And they sweeten their drinks just right"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,The almond butter toast and mashup breakfast choices were excellent!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Great espresso, creative menu, and caring staff :)"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Just incredible. Ask them for recommendations! I usually get the black swan
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Incredible food and drink with every nuance considered and executed brilliantly.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"This place is good, even if a little extra. Don't be afraid to stick to the basics, which they do well."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Wonderful selection of coffee and tea, plus delicious food!"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Food is good it's different and you got to try to Orange Blossom coffee. It's, it's the bomb"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,The best coffee ever!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,Love coming here! Very unique drinks
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Opens early, great smoothies, breakfast items and pour over coffee"
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Friendly baristas, amazing coffee, and good food options."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,The staff here are very friendly and know how to make a good pour over!
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,15-20 mins for an average cup of coffee is not justified.
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Hi Shubham, your order came in at 3:33pm and your CAP was handed to you at 3:44pm according to the security footage. The party before you had 6 drinks, which cause a little delay in getting your drink in a timelier manner. We do make things to order but perhaps it would be best to order ahead through Postmates and Doordash next time to avoid the line. We're sorry that your experience was sub-par, given the limited staffing restrictions, this is expected. Hopefully, we can see you again soon in the future."
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,One of the best breakfast options in the neighborhood
SPRO - Mission Bay/SOMA,"Delicious food and drink, friendly people, very relaxing environment :)"
