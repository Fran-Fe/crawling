Peet's Coffee,Absolutely gorgeous place for breakfast or lunch!!! Amazing coffee and kind service there ))) Thanks a lot and c U soon 🙌🏻👍🏻✌🏻👌🏻💪🏻🇺🇦✊🏻🙏🏻
Peet's Coffee,"Absolutely the worst coffee house experience we have yet to endure. My husband and myself decided to try this location instead of the one off of 16th Street. We almost always ask for hot water for the purpose of my special dietary coffee and a treat or two. The man rudely said no that we had to buy something'. I asked for the manager and asked her, informing her that we've been getting free hot water from all the other Peets for a couple year's. She rudely filled up 2 small cups and basically threw them at me, stating, she would do it this one time but ""they"" wouldn't do it again. My husband was so upset he could barely speak. First off who is they? We know it's not Peets because after this interaction we were given a lengthy apology, 2 free drinks and a guarantee a manager or 2 would be speaking to these successfully customer angering pair. So this lady who was basically saying she wouldn't give us free water because she thought we were homeless and broke; more of a reason to give free water but did not have the backbone to stand up for her personal rules. I mean no company is going to openly deny water to hungry and thirsty people in the Bay Area. FYI Peets Coffee always hands out free water just not the socially profiling one on Van Ness. Maybe she forgot what it was like to be hungry. Karma has it, she very well might be."
Peet's Coffee,Good coffee and a great selection of baked goods and sandwiches for breakfast.
Peet's Coffee,"My experience at Peet's on Van Ness for the most part was positive. I particularly appreciated the indoor seating. The cafe was visibly well managed and very clean. I appreciated the fact that Peet's offers self serving condiments unlike it's competition. The staff was good natured and very efficient. During my visit, i ordered a Medium Latte with Almond milk. The price advertised was $4.30 for a Medium Latte, but at the register the charge was $5.70. i asked if the charge was an error and i was informed that Almond milk was an extra charge. $1.40 extra. Aside from the unexpected charge. I will return to this location."
Peet's Coffee,"When I grab my mobile order the clerk says ""your not stealing that are you?"" So I showed him my app and he didn't apologize.  Then I order a cookie and brownie and the cookies not in order.  Then they give me a cookie and it's the wrong kind.  God awful experience."
Peet's Coffee,"It's a Peet's location, if you've been to one you've been to them all pretty much. Sure some are bigger, fancier, etc but they all serve coffee and snacks."
Peet's Coffee,"Really good brewed coffee, friendly staff, super clean restroom. There was a decent amount of electrical outlets, too."
Peet's Coffee,"The staff here are friendly and cheerful. Makes a delish mocha frappé!  I come here for my caffeine and sugar fix, and always leave with a smile. 😁  Just discovered the Peet's Coffee app. So far I've redeemed two free drinks of my choice. Definitely recommend downloading the app and getting coffee here! ☕"
Peet's Coffee,"Cheryl, thank you for taking the time to share your experience about our coffeebar. We're grateful to hear you enjoyed your time with our team."
Peet's Coffee,The new chicken waffle sandwich is pretty good.
Peet's Coffee,"Christine, we love hearing you enjoyed our chicken waffle sandwich and that our team took good care of you. We can't wait to serve you again soon."
Peet's Coffee,"Coffee is good, however service has been inconsisent. Staff are friendly but from the numerous times I've gone here, the coffee has taken quite a while to be made."
Peet's Coffee,"I don’t usually review chains but this Peet’s is one of the best I’ve been to. Menu and drinks as ordinary however the staff is extraordinarily friendly - not just one or two, but uniformly lovely. It’s that’s warmth that has me going here instead of the Starbucks and Philz in close proximity."
Peet's Coffee,"Perfect atmosphere for a coffee shop in the city. Kind, aware staff... key-code combo locking restroom... plentiful seating and power outlets; all making it the perfect spot to become emersed whilst reading and enjoying the best coffee in the world ... ... All of a sudden nature calls - And, oh no! - What's that? There's a total of zero (0) sleeping dirt bags in the restroom!? AND it's clean?! Where are?... Is this?.... Hey!? Did we leave SF..."
Peet's Coffee,"Daytime generally excellent, over the top excellent service, evenings, however, employees tend to be super young and there to party with each other, not work. Super loud, inappropriate conversations, belly laughter, and they start cleaning and moving furniture, sweeping, dusting, 2hrs before closing. I felt like I was in the way this evening and that I should lift my feet for the girl who started sweeping under my table. I kindly suggested it was not appropriate. She said, ""well I have to clean, so might as well get it done now."" Instead of apologizing, she said, ""well, the customer could always ask me to stop."" I suggested she ask permission before disrupting the customer, so not to make them uncomfortable in complaining.  She became defensive, failing to apologize, and acting completely dumb founded by my constructive criticisms. Again, day time service is ALL about the customers and wonderful! But, this kinda sucked."
Peet's Coffee,"Although there are few well trained barista, most of the (baristas) working for a long time on this location has not been trained to steam milk properly; they overheat the milk and burn it. I stopped buying any lattes from them after again getting the same thing for the nth time… I’ve gave them feedback, but no improvement; therefore, I thought, it’s a good idea to leave them a review here in hope of a change…"
Peet's Coffee,"This is the first time I have been here, I had called first because I received some Coffee, Beans.  As a gift. And not having a grinder didn't know what to do. Somebody said ""Peets"" would do it for Free. They were very polite and helpful.  And I after I made some, and loved it, very good coffee!☕ Thanx."
Peet's Coffee,"We entered and were immediately greeted by one of the most friendly and up beat associates, Rico. He made our experience and encouraged us to try some new or different things. I ended up getting a latte with tumeric in it. Very good !!"
Peet's Coffee,"I've been coming here for the past three years and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  The staff is really friendly, especially Jon who always has a smile on his face. Most of the baristas know how to make a tasty cup of coffee. There have been times when they fell short, but it's usually with the newbies. After some experience, they get it right.  It can get really crowded, especially on Friday mornings. But it's difficult to be impatient because service is quick.  This Peet's has an entrance to the bookstore next door.  So you can buy that book that's been on your Good Reads list and get coffee afterwards."
Peet's Coffee,"No matter which location this loyal Peetnik goes to, I am NEVER let down. Always, absolutely amazing, respectful, attentive, and awesome workers. The cleanliness is always at a high standard. I am always so impressed with every Peet's I visit. I will forever come to Peet's over any other coffee and tea place. As an avid tea drinker, I have a special appreciation for the option of loose leaf tea. I looooooove Peet's coffee!!! Thank you!"
Peet's Coffee,"Prompt, courteous service. 6-feet social distancing for the queue. Today's whole bean purchase was fairly straightforward. The Espresso Forte Dark Roasted beans have a hazelnut nuance, bright tang, and smooth crema. Free, small coffee with every bean purchase. ☕ Wish I could sit in the cafe, but alas."
Peet's Coffee,Just came in for breakfast with my family. Staff were mildly busy but were grumpy. Manager was screeching. My 10 year old made an error ordering and although we apologised you would have thought we burnt the store down. Expected better.
Peet's Coffee,I luv Pete's coffee. It has been my second time into this particular one. I ordered my drink. I had to use the W/C (restroom). They handed me a slip of paper w/scan code. It said number 43. There was a lady in line here number was 42. The counter person got upset with me because 42 number expired.  He points at the column. I had no clue what he was pointing at. I let the lady go ahead of me after all she had number 42.  Counter told me with a harsh tone her number expired. Then he realized how he was talking to me. He gave me a new number number 44. He then explained how to use the scan code and the restroom. All computerized bathroom. Would I go back yes. I like the book store next door!
Peet's Coffee,Great coffee & seasonal specials. Professional staff. Join Peet's club & earn points towards free drinks with every purchase.
Peet's Coffee,"Always a friendly staff, rich, creamy hot chocolate and no lines for the most part! Stop by Books Inc. next door, grab a book or a card and  stop for coffee. Both used to be bustling at lunchtime.  No longer."
Peet's Coffee,"Gets a bit crowded with the only coffee specialists in the area. BofA machine outside. Links to the bookstore next door. But close comfort for seating. wifi of course, and types and tastes of coffees and teas are different from the starbucks. Closes at 7pm"
Peet's Coffee,"I like Peet's because it has a very distinct aroma & flavor, but too strong or bitter. Kind'a like Star Buck's used to be!The food there is closer to ""home cooked"", or like @ a bakery."
Peet's Coffee,"I've only been to this Peet's 3 times. 2 times they have got my order wrong. One of those two times they got it wrong again even after asking them to correct the order.  Time 1: Ordered a cappuccino. Got an Americano. They were nice enough to give me a free drink voucher.  Time 2: ordered a cappuccino. Got a cappuccino, although it was a medium when I asked for small (wasn't gonna complain)  Time 3: ordered a cappuccino and an iced green tea with no sweetener. Got a cappuccino and a hot green tea latte (some matcha thing?). I asked them for what I ordered. An iced green tea with no sweetener. They came back with the same matcha latte drink but over ice. It was sweetened as well... I gave up and left."
Peet's Coffee,"I am partial to the peets on mission and 11th in San Francisco- but any one of them is excellant- I should know, I've had coffee in just about all of them: Oakland, Seattle, Portland. Ironically, all but the very first, in Berkley. See, Peet? He started the whole artisan coffee shop thing, back in the early sixties... and while the man has been dead now for a decade and a half, he still spent about two decades training a master roaster to replace himself with once he retired/died. Truly, you can tell. Of all the chain artisan coffee shops out west (which, in America, is all we have), peet's coffee and tea is second place, only to be out-roasted by stumptown roasters in rose city (Portland, Oregon, for those who don't already know.) So far as a menu I item? Try the African or Ethiopian, organic-single-source. Really, it's best to stick to what they are already brewing, which in my store is about three different kinds. That change daily. Peru is another wonderful place to grow coffee... and, of course, columbian. Peets regularly stocks all of these plus a French roast that is absolutely to die for. No Italian coffee, which is odd, since cafe is the Italian word for coffee. I suspect they just don't export, preferring to make stellar coffee a reason to visit the Mediterranean. The other thing I really appreciate about peets is how they choose to treat the folks that are homeless. From their perspective, this is always always bad for business, and yet, they choose to do it anyway. As long as you behave and don't smell bad, peets will always welcome you with open arms. Truly, that is astonishing- really, there are not adjectives that could effectively communicate just how cool they are for choosing to deal with this tragic social issue as they do. Heartwarming..."
Peet's Coffee,Good strong coffee.  Starbucks is too mild for my wife and me.  Latte quality is spotty.  Staff is very helpful.
Peet's Coffee,"This location is sub-par. Came in in the evening, ordered a coffee, asked for the bathroom and the barista (little asian guy with glasses) laughed and said it was out of order indefinitely. Non-appoligetic and flippant about it. When I commented on it (politely mind you) he said ""Well its a hard knock life"" and walked away. Couple days later I stopped in on my way to work and ordered a Breve, Batista argued with me that there was no such thing as a Breve and that ""I probably wanted a Latte"". Had to explain to her what a Breve is. Where are you getting your Batista's for this location Peet? There are much better locations than this one. The one in the Castro is super great. Avoid this one on Van Ness."
Peet's Coffee,"could've been any Peet's Coffee experience... EXCEPT that the staff at this location is super friendly, inviting, energetic and provide stellar service, especially Rico -- keep him happy and don't let go of him!"
Peet's Coffee,"Standard Pete's coffee on Van Ness with indoor seating and close location to Civic Center.  Connected to a book store, this location is nice but can get very crowded at peak times.  Worth grabbing a cup of coffee and wandering the bookstore is there isn't seating.  Prices are in line with any other Pete's Coffee."
Peet's Coffee,"I often pass this place on my way to work, so I decided to stop in. The atmosphere is nice however the cashier was kind of pushy and my white mocha was exteremly hot even after 10 minutes it was also 3/4 foam. I was very disapointed and will not return"
Peet's Coffee,Manager is an unpleasant man with racist tendencies.  It’s astounding that in this day and age people like him are allowed to get away with behavior like not allowing people of color (paying customers) to use the restroom.
Peet's Coffee,This morning a Peet's Coffee employee falsely and publicly accused a man of stealing while frightening that man's 4 year old child.  Another patron who witnessed this whole incident stood up for the falsely accused and proved that the employee was incorrect.  It was a simple mistake.  What I hated most of this ugly incident is that the employee did not accept his mistake nor did he offer any apology to this man and his son.  I guess that Peet's Coffee has a policy of racial profiling.  I'm never going to patronize this awful place again.
Peet's Coffee,"I was really disappointed. Bad and rude service. I didn't remember his name, but looks like Mexican man.why do people like this work in the service industry?!"
Peet's Coffee,Love there coffee and the lady that helped me had awsome customer service and offer me a pastry which I wasn't even thinking about getting so i glad she suggested kause i didn't realize i was hungry
Peet's Coffee,Bad customer service! The cashier (young female ) gives you an attitude when you buy something. Weirdos!
Peet's Coffee,"Saif, thanks for visiting our San Francisco coffeebar and sharing this feedback. We are sorry to hear about your negative experience with our team. Please connect with us at customerservice@peets.com so we can follow up with you directly."

Peet's Coffee,"Wren, thanks for sharing your feedback on your order of cup min tea with honey and milk! We're thrilled to hear you enjoy our coffee as much as we do ☕ We hope to see you again soon!"
Peet's Coffee,"Fast, funny, easy to use our app to pay."
Peet's Coffee,Thank you. 4 stars because the wait to order (with no customers) took way too long. The quality was great.
Peet's Coffee,"Enrique, we love seeing this! We appreciate you leaving us this rating. Check out our signature Havana Cappuccino next time!"
Peet's Coffee,Just ok.
Peet's Coffee,Absolutely love this store. The employees always greet you with a smile. A nice way to start your workday.
Peet's Coffee,Sign said store open until 9:00pm on Thursdays.  Clerk had already started cleaning decaf urn at 8:35pm and therefore couldn't / wouldn't serve a cup of brewed decaf.

Peet's Coffee,Better than the other place...I'm just wondering when the customer will have access to the restrooms

Peet's Coffee,"Well managed in rush hour crowd, and of course since it's Peet's some of the best coffee around!"
