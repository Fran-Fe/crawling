All Star Cafe,"Exceptional Philly Cheesesteak, great prices.  I saw that they had sandwiches, so I chose the Philly Cheesesteak. After about seven minutes, my sandwich was ready. I also bought a bottle of water. I don't remember the total, but it was about $12. I opened the bag to find the sandwich, a decent amount of napkins, and a bag of chips. I wasn't expecting chips and I had no idea that I had chips until I opened the bag, so I'm not sure if chips are included or if they gave them to me for free.  The Philly Cheesesteak was absolutely fantastic. The beef was tender, there was a good amount of cheese, and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. The sandwich didn't drip and didn't fall apart easily. I haven't had very many Philly Cheesesteaks, but this was the best one I've ever had.  There's no seating here, but you could sit at Market Square, which is where Twitter's HQ is at. If you're in the area and you want something delicious and inexpensive, consider visiting this place."
All Star Cafe,"From the outside this place doesn’t look like anything special, but the food and staff are really great. They serve fresh sandwiches and donuts/pastries! Donuts are moist and soft & their sandwiches are big and very affordable!"
All Star Cafe,🥰🥰🥰🥰
All Star Cafe,"One of the best Cafés I've ever been to, I came here at 11:30pm at night & Got a coffee that was really good and the guy taking the orders at the front desk was probably one of the most genuine & kind people I met in all of San Francisco. 10/10 Would highly recommend to try their Food Menu as well, For locals & especially for travelers/tourists!"
All Star Cafe,i work graveyard so my options to food are minimal. saw this place was open & tried the philly cheese steak + thai iced tea. i love thai iced tea cant go wrong there but i never really order a philly cheese steak anywhere but im glad i took a shot on it here. sandwich was totally bomb. love that theyre open 24 hrs!
All Star Cafe,😇
All Star Cafe,"This place is a hidden gem! Super straight forward donut shop, the donuts are surprisingly quality and fresh! Very affordable by SF standards, nice employees"
All Star Cafe,🥰
All Star Cafe,"Wow, what a fantastic order that was quickly delivered, at a difficult hour of 5:30am. The options were simple and exactly what I wanted: breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon and cheese on sourdough bread. And a bagel with avocado and egg. I wish you had some sauce options, but at the same time respect the simplicity. And I had a fun time adding the sauces from my own fridge to both sandwiches. On the egg, cheese, and bacon on sourdough bread, I added classic hot sauce and Dijon mustard. On the egg and avocado on a bagel, I added champagne mustard and Sriracha. I recommend both order x sauce combinations for anyone interested. #Yummers  Wow, and then the donut! Do not get me started. That was an insanely delicious delight! More like a fritter, beautifully moist on the inside and almost cake like but JN donut form. With a fun textured, tasty sugar glaze.  They also added in a complimentary bag of Lays potato chips, classic flavor. #Hospitality makes the world go round!"
All Star Cafe,"I was mistreated and discriminated against by this Hispanic young male there are photos attached. A nice and professional Asian male helped me order a cold ham and cheese sandwich to go. 3 minutes later the young Hispanic male asked was this a grilled ham and cheese I said no. He Responded in a loud tone!! I was talk to him referring to the nice Asian man. I responded back citing I was merely trying to confirm my order. I thought nothing at first, I asked if he could ring up my order he said that he was off the clock. He walked away and continued to help customers who were not black. I decided to take his photo to report him and walked out after I paid for my sandwich. Note: the nice Asian male helped me. As I exited the building the young Hispanic male ran behind me and said I dropped something and took my photo. This further supports my claim of mistreatment and discrimination."
All Star Cafe,Wonderfully good hearty food and intense sweet sweet donuts but not necessarily a great place to eat as it has clientele coming and going you may not want to sit next to you.  I usually order of the chicken teriyaki and always get it to go. It’s an excellent place for a late night early morning quick grab and go
All Star Cafe,"This place will not only hook you up with some great donuts, they'll make sure you get some good food in you as well.  First off, I just have to say that the fries here are out of this world good. Perfectly crunchy, slightly seasoned, and piping hot every single time. I would highly recommend them! In terms of food, they have french toast, spam and eggs (with rice), burgers, hash browns, etc. I've heard great things about the spam and eggs from my friends and have seen how generous the portions are myself. I think it's something like 5-6 large slabs of spam with your eggs and rice. I'm happy that this place has some vegetarian options in terms of food -- ahem veggie burger :D Although, even if they didn't have veggie options, I would basically live here for the fries.  Service is quick and food typically seems to come out quickly. If you're the area and need more than just donuts, hit this place up and grab a filling meal."
All Star Cafe,"One of the few establishments open 24/7 in San Francisco. Tonight I ordered a Chi Tea Latte, it came premixed and ran through Some sort of single serve espresso type machine. The drink was nice and hot and did taste as expected it is nothing I would rave about in either taste no quality but given the options at 3:00 in the morning this is great."
All Star Cafe,"The donuts, pastries coffee, and latte's are all absolutely DELICIOUS! Aside from the heavyset younger man with glasses, the rest of the staff are always friendly and welcoming!"
All Star Cafe,"Love the ""overload fries"" I think thats what they're called. It's like a Torta but a French fry version. I recommend trying them."
All Star Cafe,Only 24 hour business you'll find in the city. Excellent donuts excellent coffee. We need more of these places around.
All Star Cafe,"If you’re looking for bougie brunch, this isn’t it but the food is simple and good and cheap. Good ownership that also feeds the needy"
All Star Cafe,Absolutely love the bridge I did take the exit fifth street and all star cafe is right there but these photos are suppose to be under “the bay bridge”
All Star Cafe,The donuts are so good. I used to go here after school a lot. It's really close to the muni station too which is very nice.
All Star Cafe,I called around 7:30 p.m. to make an order and whoever answered the phone hung up on me
All Star Cafe,Our apologies. We get alot of phone calls from uber grubhub and doordash automated services. Which makes the phone ring nonstop sometimes. Someone working may have thought it was a automated messages. Please do call us back if that happens.
All Star Cafe,"We were visiting San Francisco due to YAGP and was looking for a place to eat lunch before my daughter attended master classes at the dance studio near by…. Found this “ Diamond in the rough”! 😎 Delicious food( I had the egg salad), friendly service… loved their apple fritter so much that I’m going to try and see if they can ship to South Dakota!"
All Star Cafe,The best Pecan Squares.  Period I drive from Oakland just for these.
All Star Cafe,..Not the way it used to look.   Market & Van Ness use to be alot worse....  M.W
All Star Cafe,"This place is wonderful! The ladies who work here phenomenal. I know it's a bit pricey. But out of the thousands of people they serve a day, she remembered me, my order and gave me a little extra meat too for coming back again! If I lived close by I would go in this place every day. The ham and cheese melt is wonderful. Nothing else just meat and cheese. I had to start getting 2 because they are so tasty. Thank you ladies when I return to the city, I will come by and say hi! Oh and get another sandwich too of course."
All Star Cafe,"There are not many places in San Francisco that are open 24 hours a day. They have a fairly extensive menu. And they make great doughnuts that are always fresh and in stock. The place looks a bit beat up, but the service is good. They have another location with the same menu at 9th and Mission that is a lot newer, but it is only open during the day but that location is where they make the doughnuts)."
All Star Cafe,"I love the $3.00 maple and chocolate custar bar donuts! Finding these is difficult. Many stores put in the custard, but never give the value of custard. At All Stars, the bar is heavily laden with custard!! Wow! I find them comforting, yet surprisingly Not a sugar bomb. Another favorite priced item is donut holes- fluffy n fresh-half a dozen, under $2.00!! If you need a snack or an inexpensive fast meal, head to All Stars, which is open 24 hours!!"
All Star Cafe,It's a small little cafe in a rough spot but the donuts and pastries are actually quite good. The employees who work in the morning are always super nice. Coffee is not great but also cheap. One of the only places in the area open before 7 AM too
All Star Cafe,Looks shady from the outside but its decent inside. The family running the place was nice and fast. We got the breakfast specials with bread +2items (bacon and egg) for $4.50. And a coffee for $2. There are some tables to eat there. Donuts and pastries available too.
All Star Cafe,Just stupidly paid $15 for a BLT and double espresso. Needless to say all pretty terrible and could have walked 5min to Hayes Valley for a much better experience
All Star Cafe,"Good sandwiches, good donuts, and they're open all night - what more can I ask for? It's not super fancy, nor is the front of the shop spotless, but that's not the point of a place like this. Also, the service is quick and the prices are low."
All Star Cafe,"Classic donut, breakfast sandwich and lunch spot! Great location, always open and great donuts/breakfast/lunch/all night food!  Has been around for a long time. Excellent philly cheese steak sandwich, fried egg sandwich, prepared salads and classic donuts.  Don't be discouraged by the 'dive' looks, that's what makes this place what it is. Unfortunately, they have fallen victim to the gentrification of the city and are being forced out to make room for yet another new, high rent building."
All Star Cafe,Solid dough! Nice people!
All Star Cafe,"We needed to get something to eat and this was open early in the morning and closeby. Wasn't really feeling what the donuts looked like, and must have stood there looking lost because guy at the register let us know that they had a full menu of other stuff too, and there was no real breakfast/lunch hours, whatever they served was all day.  I asked the same guy whether he preferred the Hawaiian BBQ chicken or the Teriyaki Chicken. He recommended the Hawaiian BBQ, and spoke pretty highly of it. And it was good, really good. They gave us the good parts of the chicken and it was well seasoned/sauced. Came with a macaroni salad and rice that I am kind of whatever about but the chicken itself is good enough for me to still recommend it.  Strictly speaking, for what you can order and  how ridiculously early you can order it, I have to give it a strong recommendation. Plus I have to give credit to the service for being able to give me a good suggestion on what to get. ,"
All Star Cafe,I love All Star Cafe the donuts seem a little pricey at first but if you can walk out with a fresh donut and a fresh cup of coffee for five bucks it's a win-win in San Francisco and the regular menu for sandwiches and so on is priced very reasonably excellent place to eat on the go truly an  icon in San Francisco. You earn all the stars...cause you all are superstars at All Star Cafe
All Star Cafe,"The young man who made me coffee on Chinese new year day was extremely cool for some poor guy who was working alone on New years day. And the coffee was great, thanks!"
All Star Cafe,Great place. Open into the wee hours. Just my type of place...lol
All Star Cafe,Over $7 for a croissant with egg and cheese. The same one at Gateway is $4.50. When I said no way she tried to lower the price as I walked out. They don’t have the prices for everything on the menu.  I hate having to haggle for my food and I do not appreciate being taken advantage of.
All Star Cafe,"You know, it's no gourmet coffee, but for a small cafe in a rough spot they always greet you with a smile and incredible service. And wherever they bring in their baked goods from must be doing something right cuz they're decadent. Don't go out of your way to try this place, but for a quick coffee/snack on your way to work, it's got everything you need."
All Star Cafe,Teriyaki beef plate is delicious 😋. I was able to eat half for lunch & half for dinner. …
All Star Cafe,"Was surprised to find out they had a lot more than just donuts. There is a reasonably large Asian menu  (pad Thai, Mongolian beef, chicken teriyaki, rice bowls, etc). They also have omelettes.  That being said, donuts are a focus here and the donuts here are fantastic. The frosted ones taste very light on the inside. They are also not on the skimpy side in terms of size. If you are a dunkin donut kind of person you'll enjoy them a lot.  The Mongolian chicken here is awesome. The chicken bits have skin on them and are super juicy, and the sauce is spicy sweet."
All Star Cafe,I love that this place is open 24 hours. Just be aware of your surroundings.  Seedy characters lurk all around. Shoot its near Market Street. Lol
All Star Cafe,"It,s one of the survivor breakfast and coffee shop chains in San Francisco. You can get a cup of ""old Joe"", as well as good old regular American breakfasts and sandwiches. I recommend strongly."
All Star Cafe,"This is my favorite place for breakfast and coffee.  The people there are wonderful, the food is great and you cannot beat their prices. Dinners are very good too."
All Star Cafe,"Not the flashest place, but, my good has been consistently great, and, theyve shown me nothing but love there. Always greeted and felt welcomed. You got to go there if you want a REAL breakfast."
All Star Cafe,One of the best 24 hour doughnut shops around! Also love the chicken and beef teriyaki over rice plate! So delicious!
All Star Cafe,Thanks so much!
All Star Cafe,"This place is decent! Ended up here by accident, had an egg sandwich which was quite tasty. Donuts look good, will try again if I end up near the conservatory again."
All Star Cafe,"Assisted a person with breakfast the cashier was rude and didnt think i should buy breakfast for that person. Before she accepted the money she made the person agree that they would take the food to go.  The shop is run down, with broken chairs, dirty walls and floor the counter glass could use some heavy duty cleaning. The fly situation is also hard to miss."
All Star Cafe,Great grab and go breakfast sandwiches.
All Star Cafe,"Definitely get the food to go, but it's delicious! I got the beef teriyaki and enjoyed it. The portions are good and the employees were nice."
All Star Cafe,"Heavy vibe and fairly sketchy but pretty good donuts, pastries, cookies & coffee 24hrs a day makes for a solid dive cafe and my go to for late night munchies (in hayes valley).  *I get munchies a lot of places*"
All Star Cafe,"Really comfortable, at best. The service was limited but nice. And I really appreciated getting a cup of hot chocolate and old fashioned donut this time of night!"
All Star Cafe,"I go for the avacado and fried egg sandwich, it's a convenient shop with Chinese serving staff. Great for a quick donut. But you'll meet the occasional crazies out on Market Street."
All Star Cafe,Excellent customer service by the one front of restaurant guy on duty running around and chef with all their orders.
All Star Cafe,Open 24hrs. Nothing terribly special about the donuts/food. I wish they hadn't disabled the A/C outlets because I frequently find myself without much charge in my phone!
All Star Cafe,"Avoid early mornings specially if you love Lattes like I do.  Great for quick breakfast sandwich and regular coffee on the go, but expect to do some waiting for your Latte."
All Star Cafe,Really fluffy and soft raised donuts here! Apple fritters are HUGE and filled with apple but too sweet and oily.
All Star Cafe,It was nice. The coffee and doughnuts are the perfect way to start the morning. It is a 24 hour place. Perfect stopover in between destinations.
All Star Cafe,Affordable yummy and nice people.
All Star Cafe,Best place is a ripoff they took my money and told me to leave after 20 minutes because I went to the bathroom and they claimed I stunk up the place
All Star Cafe,"This place is  one of the only places in the SoMa area open past midnight. If you're looking for cheap, after drinking food, this is your spot. Keep an eye out for the wondering homeless."
All Star Cafe,"Unfortunately we were very disappointed by both the food we were given, and the fact there were 3 homeless people inside that had a certain smell to them that did not help digest the already horrible food. The floor and tables too were very dirty."
All Star Cafe,All Star Cafe needs a top to bottom cleaning. It's difficult to sit in the café because there are non paying customers sitting around taking seating space. This is a very typical old school market Street business.
All Star Cafe,"If you need coffee at a late hour, I’m the downtown area, these folks are reliably open + via Uber App."
All Star Cafe,"Great friendly staff, excellent donuts especially the bear claws and apple fritters. Great breakfast and lunch menus at reasonable prices."
All Star Cafe,I always get the ham and cheese croissant heated up!
All Star Cafe,"Found a good friend here haven't seen in years when my chic and I had to post up after a show at the DNA lounge, Bart wasn't open lol, now going back tonight to find him his family misses him pray for him and that we find him"
All Star Cafe,Staff is always cool and sometimes busy. But the place is a nice little donut and coffee spot if your the area of Market and Van Ness.
All Star Cafe,Awesome teriyaki chicken and rice and they make a mean Philly cheese steak as well
All Star Cafe,My most visited spot.  Great doughnuts and food.  Hella close to a bunch of wifi hotdpots
All Star Cafe,Employee was high and said the place is closed. I asked what time they close (24 hours) and he said he's on his break. 7pm on June 26.  Changing rating due to response from business.
All Star Cafe,Sorry! thanks for letting us know. Wont happen again. He is new. As you know it is hard to find employees at the moment we are trying our best! Thanks for understanding!
All Star Cafe,"Very bad experience, we ordered two coffees and asked for the receipt of payment. The server refused to provide a receipt, very rudely refunded the money and then refused to serve us."
All Star Cafe,Super delicious donuts! Service is quick and nice people. Love it!
All Star Cafe,"Love this place, they are always so nice and friendly. They reserved a bunch of doughnuts for me to bring to work."
All Star Cafe,3rd time in a row they got my order wrong. I shouldn't have to check before I leave. I'll never go there again!
All Star Cafe,"The sandwiches are good, the donuts aren't overpriced, and the crazy street people aren't allowed inside unless they're buying something."
All Star Cafe,"Open 24hrs. Good food, good selection of various types of food, friendly staff, clean and sanitary conditions, fresh ingredients and fast."
All Star Cafe,Excellent coffee...and we really appreciate attention of Lucas when we are lost and he help us to find our street. Thanks again. (Paulo e Larissa do Brasil)
All Star Cafe,"Good food, fair prices, good service. This place is awesome!"
All Star Cafe,The bartender didn't know how to make an item on their menu (mocha) and when he made an attempt it turned out horribly.  The store itself is also very cramped
All Star Cafe,"Great food to go or eat there enjoying the view of two of the main streets of San Fransisco ,Market st and Vann Ness."
All Star Cafe,Dodgy place. Visited quarter before 11 in the evening on a Wednesday.  Guy at the counter tried to cheat us by telling us we gave smaller amount not giving proper change.
All Star Cafe,Great little shop for donuts on the way to the office. Get some here before start time and your co-workers will think the world of you.

All Star Cafe,"If you're in a rush, you can grab a coffee and donut at a great price."
All Star Cafe,Love the freshly made old-fashioned glazed donuts ... Yum!
All Star Cafe,"This is an extremely horrible place. Be careful with one rude guy there, very bad attitude and charge higher than it suppose to be."
All Star Cafe,Place looked dingy an dirty.Apple fritter wasn't fresh and over priced.
All Star Cafe,All Star Cafe is great late night food. Best in the city
All Star Cafe,This place has alot of homeless people that hang out and they occassionally harass custoners and beg for everything.
All Star Cafe,"Great donuts, but a lot of homeless people around."
