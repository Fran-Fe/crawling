Sammie Cafe,"The staff here is absolutely lovely and they make a *solid* sandwich. You can also get them on gluten-free bread or ask for any sandwich done as a salad! They do breakfast Sandwiches all day and a nice fresh made smoothie selection. Also, the chocolate chip cookies are 🤤"
Sammie Cafe,MilkBean cafe rebranded. All your favorites are still on the menu with some slight name changes. The sandwiches are fantastic. My favorite the Sam is great! Perfect spot for brunch and a coffee!
