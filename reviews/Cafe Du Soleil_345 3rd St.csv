Cafe Du Soleil,"Very unassuming place but impressed a diner like me. This place is underrated in my opinion. Owner is warm and friendly from France. Popped by while waiting for my car rental nearby. I ordered Mushroom sandwich (add chicken) which I thought was perfect. One of the best breakfast around the corner. Latte was no ordinary latte, very good!"
Cafe Du Soleil,"fresh, delicious, healthy, with wonderful service. a real soma gem!! i love the nicoise salad and egg salad sandwich."
Cafe Du Soleil,"Just incredible! I was the only one present and walked right in and ordered the Turkey Avocado, OJ, and an Espresso so I could do some work. Everything was made to perfection. Bravo!"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Would rate more than 5 stars if possible. Stopped at this unassuming place for a quick brunch and were blown away by the staff's friendliness and care in preparation of our brunch. Food was phenomenal, bread was superb, avocados were perfect, fruit salad was delicious, and mango smoothie was exacting in fruit and spinach ratio. When asked for salt and pepper with our to-go order the staff hand ground some black pepper and pink sea salt into tiny takeout containers for us! Perfect!"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Incredible chicken sandwich. Also try the apple butter! Best sandwich I’ve had in SF. Fantastic customer service, even ran down the road to find me when I left my bag in the shop. Complete legend."
Cafe Du Soleil,"I must say my pictures don’t do justice to this place. I am a petit person of 5’2 but this place def serves big portions. The owner is such an amazing pop with culinary career in France and Italy, so the sandwiches are the European ciabatta sandwich which I haven’t seen much in SF. I got the Brie prosciutto sandwich and my friend got the mango salad—first day of serving the salad according to the owner. The portion is HUGE  with chicken tossed in herb/aioli(?) sauce, super flavorful. I am def coming back to try the rest of the menu. The food does take a bit of time to come out since it’s run by two lovely people but its def worth the wait."
Cafe Du Soleil,Bright Shiny sandwich place to look forward to between tall buildings. The owner is very welcoming and the food is wonderful. Fresh ingredients put together on a warm crunch bread. I can't wait to go back!
Cafe Du Soleil,"This place is absolutely amazing. So cute and comforting, food is all so good. Big portions for a great price. We had a big group and tried the chicken tarragon sandwich, the Caesar salad, and the poki bowl. I highly recommend all of it! We’ll be back :)"
Cafe Du Soleil,"The chicken sandwich is without a doubt one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Full stop.  The owner (presumably, maybe he's a manager or just seems to be in charge) is one of the nicest people you'll come across in the business.  Oh, and it's super affordable with large portion sizes."
Cafe Du Soleil,Small restaurant that I think does mainly take out but my husband and I sat out by the sidewalk and enjoyed brunch. The Croque Madam was delicious and the staff was great.
Cafe Du Soleil,"We had lunch here, and it was exquisite! The service was really warm and authentic as well. I was visiting from the UK, but I will remember this place when I visit San Francisco again."
Cafe Du Soleil,"Cosy little cafe by the road. Good food , good prices and friendly staffs."
Cafe Du Soleil,"It's the best breakfast I have had in California, it's delicious"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Incredibly quaint, cute place.  delicious food.  The best turkey avocado sandwich I have ever had!  I had a sandwich/salad combination and it was fantastic.  I am in town for the week and would definitely come back again."
Cafe Du Soleil,"Found this restaurant on Google and super happy we did.  This was definitely a good find today. We had their soup squash curry special today.  I had salad & portobello, brie, & red pepper sandwich on crusty bread.  Hubby  had omelette ham, cheese, spinach, & ham.  With a cup of “fresh” mango.  Michael was a delight.  Everything was so clean.  We will be coming back soon."
Cafe Du Soleil,"WOW!!  A little bit of France right here in San Francisco. Great place for a group of 3 that wanted both pastries and’real breakfast’. The almond croissant was just like Paris. The eggs and bacon were superb and came with delicious, fresh homemade toast. The owner waited on us, and was cheerful, fun and helpful"
Cafe Du Soleil,Terrible service. Just need a coffee to go. The guy at the register was babbling on the phone without taking my order. Waited for a good 3-4 mins and he shushed me when I tried to order
Cafe Du Soleil,Great salads and sandwiches made fresh. The small salad portion is more like a large so come hungry or save half for later. Whether or not you have to wait in line depends on the day.
Cafe Du Soleil,"Such a positive experience. Fresh delicious sandwiches, genuine and kind service, cute place. 5/5"
Cafe Du Soleil,"My experience here felt intimate because the owner is very hands on, insuring a great meal at a great location. I recommend the chicken Tarragon sandwich which was amazing. This place has something special going on."
Cafe Du Soleil,One of the best sandwiches I've ever experienced. A little slice of Paris in San Francisco.
Cafe Du Soleil,"Got the chicken, avo, mango salad and it’s soooo yummy!"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Absolute favorite go to spot for brunch, coffee and pastry. Hands down the best quality food and coffee in the neighborhood and reasonably priced relative to other places. Owner and staff are exceptionally welcoming. Place is incredibly cozy and well kept with European flair. Highly recommend it for locals and visitors!"
Cafe Du Soleil,"I had a caffe latte on each of two occasions last week at Cafe Du Soleil.  The drinks were outstanding.  We enjoyed great seating on the sidewalk.  Service inside was very pleasant and the operator/owner even spoke French (!) consistent with the name of the venue.  On my second visit, late in the afternoon, I ordered two caffe lattes and asked that they be decaf.  When they arrived at the table, I asked for confirmation that they were decaf and the server (owner?) realized they were not.  Without prompting, he graciously took back the drinks and a few minutes later returned with decaf replacements.  That's great service."
Cafe Du Soleil,Perfect place. The best you can get. Don't miss out! The owner is so nice and friendly. The food is amazing and made by the best ingredients with much love.
Cafe Du Soleil,Very good place for sandwiches. My favorite is roasted chicken warm sandwich in french baguette (with tomatoes in it - it becomes so juicy and nice!)
Cafe Du Soleil,Fantastic french cafe - their salads are the best you can find in the area. Sandwiches are always delicious.  It’s a bit of a walk for me to get there at lunch between meetings when I WFH or else I’d be there a lot more often!
Cafe Du Soleil,"Really good salads and sandwiches here. The salads are a really good value as the large salad is huge and can honestly be split into two meals. My favorite is the Turkey sandwich. The owner is very friendly and talkative. The one downside is that they are really slow. However, if you call ahead or order online, you won't have to wait in line and can just pick it up when its ready which is what I do 95% of the time."
Cafe Du Soleil,Get the smoked salmon tartine. So yummy
Cafe Du Soleil,"Great food. I'm especially fond of the Chicken Mango Avocado salad, probably the only salad in the city that actually fills me up. Michael (owner) is tremendously polite.  It gets busy during weekday lunches, especially 12:00 to 12:30pm. Not a lot of seating, so mostly a pickup place. Recommend calling ahead or ordering online."
Cafe Du Soleil,"So happy to be the first to review Cafe Du Soleil. It's a little cafe that has a few tables for seating, but during lunch hours it seemed like a lot of people were ordering to-go. The food is very worth the value, and the shop itself is neighborly. The owner is so kind to his customers, and clearly has friendships and relationships with regular visitors.  I'd gone two times in one week, first getting the nicoise salad (which was full of healthy ingredients and flavor) as well as the ham and cheese sandwich. Both were great, but what really impacted me was that the owner never rushed me as a customer. When I went with my friend, he welcomed us to stay as long as we needed to catch up, and even served us free pastries since we had finished our meal. It was a kind gesture and made us feel welcomed and wanted. I'd definitely come here whether its to have a good conversation, or a quick to-go meal."
Cafe Du Soleil,Here with friends on a trip and we happened to come here because it was near our hotel. It must have been fate because this place was absolutely incredible! Great place to come and incredible food/ coffee. Recommend to anyone local or visiting!
Cafe Du Soleil,Awesome staff creating some of the best sandwiches in SF! The salads are phenomenal as well and come in very generous portions. Great take-out option for lunch meetings or a picnic in Yerba Buena. Highly recommend!!
Cafe Du Soleil,Michael and his team are fantastic! Accommodated a party of 10 with excellent food & service. Highly recommended. Thanks again!
Cafe Du Soleil,Quaint little place for some nice brunch or lunch.
Cafe Du Soleil,Excellent food and service! The smoked salmon was tasty and the baggette roll it was on was very soft and fresh . The capers added to the saltiness of the dish. A cup of bueno Joe and I was set .
Cafe Du Soleil,"Amazing, fresh ingredients, great bread, attention to detail.  I can recommend literally anything here, though my favorite is the Pastrami, Cheddar, and Apple.  If you're going for lunch, make sure to call and put your order in ahead of time, as the lunch rush may keep you waiting for an extended period of time."
Cafe Du Soleil,so delicious! came here twice over my four day visit in San Francisco. Got the half sandwich and half salad and was given very large portions! the fruits were so fresh and tasty and the bread was delicious.
Cafe Du Soleil,"I really like the roasted chicken sandwich here, I would recommend it."
Cafe Du Soleil,"The turkey and avocado sandwich is an experience not to be missed.  Honey chutney provides the perfect amount of organic sweetness to an ordinarily neutral sandwich that takes this to a new level.  Mated with the amazing bread - satisfyingly crunchy crust while still being perfectly tender inside, this sandwich delivers!  I matched this with the petite asparagus and Scottish smoked salmon salad (sandwich and salad combo), which is a meal in and of itself!  The salmon has no fishiness to it, and the  the asparagus, roasted red peppers and red onions are complemented by the light dressing.  There is plenty of food in this combo - you could easily satisfy yourself with half and save the other half for later!  :-)  Finally, you can't help but be impressed by the owner:  gracious, friendly and polite, he and his creations provide an experience that merits the long line outside Cafe du Soleil during the lunch hour."
Cafe Du Soleil,"Good ingredients and friendly if overworked staff. The place is popular at noon. A friend and I got sandwiches. Tough, chewy (in a good way) baguettes with squishy fillings (egg salad and the portobello mushroom). They were really messy to eat and by the time we were halfway through, everything had squeezed out and there was nothing left inside but mayo. I'd come back, but get a salad next time."
Cafe Du Soleil,"Small place but with big flavour. Cafe du Soleil is near my work so I come here for lunch from time to time. It's a small place that can get really busy during lunchtime (but not always) - I'm talking like wait for 30+ min to line up and then get your food. (I just learned from their website today that you can actually call in to place a pickup order - good to know). Once you do get your order, you'll be lucky if you get a table to sit at since there are only about a handful available indoors and outside. That all being said, the food is on point. Among other things, I've had the chicken and orzo salad (petite was more than enough for me), cheddar apple and pastrami sandwich, and prosciutto and brie sandwich. Since they're on ciabatta bread, the sandwiches feel almost ""too bready"" sometimes. During my last visit, I was with my cousin and she had the turkey and brie sandwich as well as the nutella mascarpone strawberry croissant, both of which she enjoyed. Overall, it's a good place to get a bite to eat so I'm sure I'll continue coming by :)"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Parisian exactness meets NoCal chill. The strongest espresso, the butteriest croissants. The first time I walked in it was raining out and Sun Ra was playing on the speakers. RIP to a legend, thanks for letting me use your WiFi when I was a broke student. When I become a billionaire I will reopen and give out free dog treats and donate all unsold pastries."
Cafe Du Soleil,"Great lunch spot which impressed in 3 areas oftentimes not experienced together: quickness, proportions, and quality. Had the half and half with egg salad sandwich and nicoise salad. Really enjoyed this place!"
Cafe Du Soleil,I was just passing through the city making pickups going back east when I stumbled across this joint. Very nice people running the place and the ham n swiss croissant is outstanding. Keeping this place on my radar fo sho 👍 …
Cafe Du Soleil,Super duper salad place! You should try big size salad and you can share it with 3-4 people. You can save plenty of money in SF expensive lunch culture haha :)
Cafe Du Soleil,"Go here if you like  staff more focused on their phones than the customers, long lines, long waits, and over-priced sandwiches.  I would not recommend the ahi tuna unless you enjoy sticking wasabi up your nose; really over did it with the sauce. Less is more , guys!  For preorders or luncheons I've had relatively good experiences, although expensive"
Cafe Du Soleil,"The ham sandwich was simply amazing, totally recommend this place!"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Wonderful friendly owner who always has a smile. Delicious fresh salads big enough to share with fresh cut avocado, tomato, strawberries and more!"
Cafe Du Soleil,Best coffee beans ever used here. There food is superb as well. The owner runs this establishment daily and sourced the coffee himself and has been using it for over 20 years and I can see why.
Cafe Du Soleil,"Despite being short staffed with a convention happening right around the corner, Cafe du Soleil was able to provide me with wonderful customer service and a delicious croque monsieur for lunch"
Cafe Du Soleil,"Came by here for lunch the Nicoise salad was very good, and I got a large by mistake. It was huge. Get the small for 1 person. The place is very small, and the lunch crowd overwhelms the place pretty quickly."
Cafe Du Soleil,"PROPER cappuccino is made here, period. I mean, we're talking about consistent foam, good espresso, and affordable price point? Oh boy, what is Blue Bottle? Don't even compare!"
Cafe Du Soleil,Best place to get salad and baguette with HUGE portions of salad and reasonably price points that put other places to shame. Every time I do a takeout here I'm always surprised how heavy my salad are.
Cafe Du Soleil,Best prosciutto sandwich anywhere!  We had one last February and are looking forward to coming back to SF next week (from the east coast) and getting another.
Cafe Du Soleil,"The food is outstanding!  Great care is taken with the preparation of each meal.  Ingredients were fresh, and well balanced."
