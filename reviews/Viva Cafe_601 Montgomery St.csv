Viva Cafe,"This lunchspot is a hidden gem in the financial district - everyone comes back after eating - truly customized and delicious meal, generous portion, and a great chef and owner known as “V”!  7/14/23 update: they now serve breakfast from 7:30-11:30am. They cater and customize your breakfast and lunch even when you order on the fly! Five stars!!!"
Viva Cafe,Clean and we'll run hole-in-the-wall cafe in downtown San Francisco (Union Square).  Pros:  1. Delicious and flavorful food. 2. Doesn't skimp on the meats. Lots of veggies too. 3. Friendly owner and staff. 4. Great pricing.  Pretty much just grabbed my lunch there the 8/14 days I stayed in San Francisco.
Viva Cafe,"oh my goodness --- this is the most amazing flavor, lunch spot, food, and DEAL in the SF area!  The food is amazingly delicious and the portions are humongous --- and so reasonably priced!  Home-cooked gourmet meals, all freshly prepared.  Just point to what you want.  Fresh every day.  The head chef/owner can whip up whatever else you'd like and add it all into your box, all for the same price.  Amazing food and wonderful mom-and-pop vibe.  Extra bonus points that this place is hidden toward the back of the hotel lobby too -- what a gem of a find!"
Viva Cafe,"Came here for a TGTG pickup - the food is delicious and so well seasoned, staff is wonderfully friendly, and I'm so full!! 😊😊"
Viva Cafe,"Viva Cafe, a perfect little ""hole in the wall"" coffee shop tucked in a hot tech firm building.  My office is located on the top floor of this building and it's only natural that this beautiful cafe becomes your ""home away from home"". The food is amazingly fresh and organic with plenty of flavors to go around. Daily specials are always a treat and a surprise. Especially when Italian Sausage Sandwiches, Chicken Tamales and BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches are on the menu that day (they run out quick)! Your daily picks in the mini fridge are chicken salads, fruit salads, acai bowls, parfait bowls, meaty sandwiches, artisan pastries and a wide variety of coffees and drinks! Believe me when I say that this building runs on coffee... the employees that work in this building are powered by none other than Viva Cafe.  The owner and chef, Vadim is a genuine badass! If he notices you're becoming a regular at his spot, the cafe's prices get hacked just for you. He takes detailed care and talented craftsmanship to your orders, almost as if he makes it a goal to get it perfectly tailored to your taste each time!  *Ask for catering details, if you're interested. Ask for wifi password."
Viva Cafe,"I’m so sorry to post half eaten food, but I just couldn’t help digging before I can do this, it smelled and looked too good.  Not sure how this place was unnoticed by me, for all these years working in this area, this place is hiding in the HSBC building, you need to enter the building on Montgomery st. And go kind of behind the elevator.  While I was waiting for the food, I asked about the pastry that looked really yummy, he explained it’s called Napoleon. I told him ill try next time when I bring my wallet me.  He cut up 2 big Napoleons for me and said whenever next time if/when I’m back.  This just warmed up my heart so much.  This, reminds me of old San Francisco, when the bus driver tells me that when I didn’t have enough coins… made my day, the food is amazing, thank you thank you thank you I will be back there!!"
Viva Cafe,"We loved their food! Tried once last week and came back yesterday. :-) It’s 10 min drive from us but definitely worth it since they are very nice and provide delicious meals. If you are around and hungry, just go there! You won’t regret. :-)"
Viva Cafe,Just tried the place from Too Good Togo app and friendly staff and chef. Food was excellent and fresh very good. Will order a full entree next time since I live close by. Support your local business and restaurant keep it alive yall. Also as you can tell excellent portion size for a carry out order
Viva Cafe,Food is fresh and delicious. The man working the counter is kind and friendly. Definitely recommend checking out if you’re in the area!
Viva Cafe,"I tried this place with the Too Good To go app and I was very happy with my discovery. The chef was very friendly and he made me a custom vegetarian salad with lemon rice, beans, fresh vegetables and polenta, it was delicious! I will definitely go back!"
Viva Cafe,"Taste food, the best small hidden place in the area. Food made with armenian soul. Delicious, highly recommend"
Viva Cafe,"Such a good deal, amazing food! I travel for work so wanted to try this on Too Good to Go, but would come here more often if I lived/worked here. Every component so flavorful, so rich, and filling—especially the chicken with the green sauce!"
Viva Cafe,"Tiny store but AMAZING food!!! I bought a box of rice and a good variety of meats and veggies & fruit under #TooGoodToGo for only $5.99. Super yummy and big portion! Too bad it’s far from where I live, or I’ll visit this place everyday!"
Viva Cafe,"Wow, what a gem! The food is DELICIOUS. The people running the cafe are so kind. The sauces are to die for. Everything is seasoned perfectly. I came with the too good to go app and asked if they could make a vegan bowl (usually customizations are not allowed) and the lovely chef made a delicious bowl for me. I would give 6 stars if I could."
Viva Cafe,The best food on the TooGood to go! And the service is excellent
Viva Cafe,simple food made amazing with flavor and sauces. don’t underestimate this tiny lunch counter!!!
Viva Cafe,"Absolute hidden gem tucked away inside a large building on Montgomery. The food is phenomenal. Brought tears to my eyes. Today was Lebanese chicken, rice and beans, and vegetarian polenta with Chimichurri and hot sauce. Everything is made fresh. Tastes like the homemade meals of ones' childhood. I'll be going back every week."
Viva Cafe,"Viva is the best lunch spot, I’m vegetarian and am always super happy with the portions and fresh ingredients!"
Viva Cafe,I got the chicken burrito bowl and I was not disappointed! The flavors were all amazing. Down to the rice and roasted vegetables. Good portion and variety of meals to choose from. It is tucked past the elevators in the HSBC building. I’ll be trying the breakfast bowl next!
Viva Cafe,"Glorious breakfast! Fresh, wholesome food, not-greasy"
Viva Cafe,It was not what we've expected (little Cafe to sit) but it was so surprising good. We made a good deal: salmon with Rice for the two of us (Not really hungry) for $5 :))
Viva Cafe,"I seriously loved this place! The food was absolutely delicious!! They had different rice varieties to choose from, salmon, teriyaki style chicken, and the potatoes were cooked to perfection!"
Viva Cafe,Posting this review is hard because this place is my secret lunch spot but it's too good not to share. V takes great care of his customers and does not skimp on the portions! Great homemade food in an unassuming office lobby - you have to try it!
Viva Cafe,Hidden gem! Discovered through the app “Too good too go”.
Viva Cafe,"A gem in the city. Don't be fooled by the fact it's set in an alcove behind the building security officer. The owner made me a custom breakfast bowl that was equal parts healthy, tasty, and filing. Two cups of black coffee needed no cream or sugar. I told him I'd see him the next morning. He recommended to come in before 8 if i wanted to sample the pastries - they're made in house in small batches and are usually snatched up by the local business peeps on their way into the office."
Viva Cafe,Awesome food! Best kept secret in FiDi for lunch
Viva Cafe,"Great, tasty, and healthy food with a generous portion. This is one of my most favorite places to go for lunch in downtown San Francisco."
Viva Cafe,"Incredibly friendly chef, delicious and healthy food with great mix of legumes, grains, proteins, veggies all marinated and spiced for a memorable and no nonsense grab and go experience"
Viva Cafe,"Edit:  I would no longer recommend this spot.  The menu is the same but the staff has changed and don’t give you the same experience.  The owner has moved on to another location.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<  An excellent little coffee shop is hidden inside 550 Kearny@Sacramento.  Amazing fresh and huge salads and really good Philz coffee. You've got to understand that for me to praise coffee says a lot.  Also, breakfast croissant sandwiches and muffins.  Enormous sandwiches for lunch made fresh to order and toasty, if you want.  Give it a try. The owner, Chef Vadim, is a very nice guy and knows what it takes.  *Bonus for FREE WI-FI and tons of quite seating. The clean new bathrooms, that are open to the public, are the cherry on top.  TV with sports too!"
Viva Cafe,"Amazing little cafe, great food!"
Viva Cafe,Great guys! Very friendly owner who gives you more food than you asked for. Food tasted amazing and cost was honestly ridiculously small compared to the amount of food I got from them. 10/10 would recommend.
Viva Cafe,Wasnt expecting the food to be amazing! We came right as he opened and he didn’t have anything but he still served us. He whipped together an amazing breakfast and he had a good personality. Definetly check this place out.
Viva Cafe,"Unfortunately, the service is not the best as I did not feel welcomed. I heard some judgements and assumptions made towards me and that did not feel right. The food was okay but with little vegetarian options."
Viva Cafe,Insane breakfast burritos. So good.
Viva Cafe,Best cash value I ever got on too good to go! Super friendly staff and delicious food

Viva Cafe,"As an Asian who is very particular about food, you can come to this exotic cuisine for dinner! It is very recommended to come to this restaurant to eat. The portion size and taste are very ideal. A man with a large appetite can eat very full. It is suitable for students and people who want to eat food other than gluten. One serving is quite enough for my husband and I! It’s really a restaurant in Chaofo in San Francisco. The food is not processed food. You can see that it’s all real ingredients, and the taste is acceptable to Asians♥️  The boss is very nice, I hope the business is booming ^ - ^"
Viva Cafe,They participate with Too Good to Go and the Mediterranean dishes are superb for 6$
