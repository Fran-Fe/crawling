Nina's Cafe,"I discovered this breakfast place only in one of my last days in San Francisco, unfortunately. After that, I have been there twice.  If you want a cheap and tasty breakfast, you should come to Nina’s cafe, Nina is also super friendly!  Will be my regular breakfast place next time I come to San Francisco."
Nina's Cafe,"Awesome value for the money, blows Subway out of the water with a similar menu.  The sandwiches are large, fresh, and delicious.  There is also a rotating selection of lunch-sized portions of lasagna, chicken salad, and other sides.  I highly recommend the mozzarella+tomato+basil sandwich which comes with a huge portion of mozzarella."
Nina's Cafe,"This place has been all over my Instagram feed for a while now, and since I've been living in NYC, I haven't been able to try it until now. I went today with a friend, and luckily caught them right before they were about to close (Heads up - this place is a truck! Their hours are pretty reliable, though!) The guy working was super friendly and welcoming, which I always appreciate!  My friend and I both got the original acai bowl ($10.50 including acai, granola, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, shaved coconut, and honey), but it was so hard to choose what to get! They have 3 different acai bowl flavors, but they also have smoothies, fresh juices, and even poke bowls! I want to go back and try more! The acai bowl was very good - lots of fresh veggies and granola. The acai mixture itself was a bit icy, but not too sweet, which I liked.  So glad I was able to try this place out! I highly recommend it!"
Nina's Cafe,"Terrible breakfast burrito. More of a breakfast wrap, no salsa, jack cheese, avacado, nothing. Just some bright orange american cheese and some hot sauce. Saw it being made and asked if they could put some salsa or spicy cheese on there to make it more like a burrito I got a rude no."
Nina's Cafe,"So let's say you're in Berkeley, and the thought of yet another vegan tofu seitan ""delight"" on a baked-in-the-moonlight roll with sprouts served to you by a ponytail-waving middle-aged ex-stock broker leaves you cold, what do you do?  Hie on over to Nina's Café, where Nina her own self will charmingly proffer the usual café kit and kaboodle, along with truly satisfying alternatives like the chicken curit with rice and salad that I just enjoyed. Not spicy, but properly spiced.  Free WiFi; she'll hand you the login info upon request.  Sidewalk seating too. A must-repeat."
