Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Hard to get good coffee in SF, and this place is no exception. Don't come here if you want light roast delight. Sextant Roasters knows a good deal about coffee, but not the folks who serve the brew here. It was a challenge to get tasting notes. They only offer one medium roast as espresso… and that one turned out to be bitter… Milk alternatives are normally here - but not today. They ran out.. too bad. the backyard is nice though. Overall... Don't bother to come."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Solid coffee with great gluten free pastries!  I recently hosted an event and I bought a large container of coffee. Their service was super fast and they had it ready in 15 min.  They have a variety of Asian flavored desserts as well as the usually croissants and cookies. They also have a few gluten free options, I recommend the banana walnut cookie"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Spacious coffee shop with your standard load out of coffee/espresso drinks. I had the drip coffee, which today was the Connoisseur blend. It was served at perfect drinking temperature (I feel like typically places will serve it hotter than drinkable).  Connoisseur - blend from columbian beans. Had sour notes+aftertaste and a bit zesty. Slightest hint of cherry. Did not taste the apple or honey cocoa as suggested in the flavor profile."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Great quality of third-wave roaster and coffee shop directly working with farmers across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Colombia. My favorite coffee here are Americano and Cappuccino. Their pastries from local shops are really good too."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Really good coffee and probably one of the best Kouign-amann I never tried . The only downside of this coffee place is that they don’t have outlet near the seating area
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This coffee shop will receive my five-star rating. Everything went smoothly and without any issues. They always gave it their all and have a high level of customer satisfaction. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend this location! Thank you all so much for your generous assistance. Excellent work!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Very unique roasting and tastes very good.  I believe it's because their source of the bean with onsite roast makes the coffee fresh.  They also have a back yard area for customers to sit and enjoy their coffee.  Their cold brew is a must to try.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you  very much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Recently moved to the neighborhood and stopped by this place after hearing good things. I can say it lives up to its good reputation. The cold brew was one of the best I’ve had in the city and Amber & Isobel were super friendly and welcoming.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"My favorite cafe in the neighborhood, and possibly in the city as well.  Love the light-filled space and the brick walls, but I think the best part is the patio in the back.  Very friendly staff, and what tops the experience?  They give out **amazing** 🐶 treats 🐾"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Despite the grey exterior, this is a relaxing spot with earthy vibes inside. Great place to sit down and do some work. Good coffee and croissant too."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Brilliant independent coffee roastery in San Francisco - worth the hype! I had heard good things about Sextant and it definitely lived up to expectations.  Great range of brewing methods,  delicious Ethiopian pour-over, and really helpful and knowledgeable staff."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,You are so kind. Thank you so very much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"One of the best coffee roasters and coffee shops in the SoMa area of SF. They have not just good coffee, but GREAT coffee here! It’s a lovely space inside and out, with a nice quiet garden area out the back with a few tables and benches. Staff are friendly and helpful. There’s a good selection of coffees and other merch, which is well designed and reasonably priced."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I think I might have gone on an unusually bad day based on the other reviews. We think that the machine or something was not clean or properly working. 3/4 people in our group, took one drink and threw it away….the 4th person is just to stubborn to throw away food or drink. We each had different drinks from espresso to drip, mocha and latte so we think it was fundamental with the beans going through the machine.  I ordered a mocha and I think the barista forgot to add chocolate? If that’s possible.  Anyway, we had to write a review because it was as bad as it can get. From expense to not a human taking our order to no descriptions of the items in the case, no cream or sugar stand, and they were out of brown sugar. All that being said, we would have forgotten all of that if at first sip, we were “ahhed” and satisfied. It wasn’t even drinkable….we dropped them at the first trash can and went to 711 and drove home.  The employees today did seem very nice and were helpful us with our questions and desires for brown sugar. They apologized for that.  The presentation was good, the guy poured it and it looked cool but it just tasted so terrible.  4 hungover people about to drive back to San Jose and we threw the coffee out! Do you know how bad it has to be for that to happen!?  $14 for quad shot espresso."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,I am sorry for your experience that was not what we strive for our customers. Usually people are very happy with the quality of our drinks and service.  Hopefully you can give us a second chance and we can make it happen.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Possibly the best espresso I have ever had.  There aren't many coffee places that I would go out of the way to visit, but this is definitely one of them.  Just amazing."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,You are so very much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very nice cafe ambiance. Very good coffee - if you like unflavored lattes, this place will not disappoint you. Good pastries. Friendly and good baristas. Music can get a little loud."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank You Very Much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Vertical coffee at its best. This is a Black owned business. The owner has relationships with coffee farmers in Ethiopia and roasts his beans fresh in the back. Sometimes if a particular bean isn’t available up front you can ask if they have any in the back that haven’t been bagged yet. They charge extra to use a credit card so if you buy beans pay with cash to save a buck. I love the low acidity and smoothness of The Windsor, but Maiden Voyage is great for espresso. Their website is frustrating because it says pick up in person is possible but it doesn’t always allow it, and if you want subscription there’s no way to have it be picked up rather than shipped."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,I ordered a mocha and the barista accidently forgot the chocolate. It was super busy or the barista had a lot on their mind—all of which are valid.  I told the barista and they quickly made me one w chocolate. Ace customer service if you ask me.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This was always my favorite hidden SOMA gem, and after getting to know the owner Kinani, it is now my go-to spot for beans in the city as well. He's a passionate first generation Ethiopian who truly knows his stuff, if you want to geek out on 🫘.  Other pluses: big beautiful space that always smells like coffee (they roast on site,) a relatively quiet back patio (for SOMA), and my favorite perk: a free trip coffee when you buy a bag of beans ;)  Wishing Kinani all the best"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very mediocre and disappointing. The coffee was fine, but nothing special for a $8 price tag (with 20% default tip) and below average service. The barista was very aloof and mildly unfriendly and so as the guy grinding coffee who seemed to be a manager. The outdoor patio is nice but the place itself is pretty small and not as vibey as it looks in the pictures. Nothing to come back to."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Come here and get the Wired Gandhi (dirty chai) because it is to die for! We love that this coffee shop is dog-friendly and has WiFi and tables for working. The baristas are always so friendly and sometimes give Calli treats!  We’ve tried an almond croissant, peanut butter chocolate cookie, and a blueberry scone (my favorite of the three being the scone) and they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  Will definitely be coming back here again and again!! Highly recommend"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Super cute cafe, friendly staff and good cappuccino. Although it's not my ultimate favourite coffee in SF it's pretty good. (Everyone has different tastes so it's never comparing apples to apples) Coffee well made and milk was steamed well for a cappuccino."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 😊
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Amazing, light-soaked interior - brick walls and wooden ceiling. You sit next to the roasting machine. Very friendly staff. Delicious coffee. An inspiring founder story (see their website).  Ample space to sit and strong wifi, so this feels like a good place to get some work done. Note that there are no power outlets though.  For breakfast, they have some pastries but not otherwise much food selection."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"The most expensive pour over i have ever had. It was yirgacheffe and ok. It didn't blew my mind. It had to for a $10+ coffee with tip. Nice open area, great to work/study/chat."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Coffee room temperature, turkey sandwich was a ham croissant and cold in the center, coffee steamed to end up being ambient temperature within zero seconds. The piece of cake ended up being a corner store muffin.  First place award to recommend looting when the fabric of society unravels goes to ...... One word to describe service: piddliwink."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Wow, I'm blown away. I ordered an americano and now I can safely say that this cafe KNOWS espresso. Some places will give you something very sour or astringent, but this was heaven. They used their Maiden Voyage beans and frankly I think it was the best americano I've ever had. The barista was great and he answered some questions I had. The atmosphere is very inviting. Also, they roast their beans right in the back of the shop. I can't wait to go back!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Great experience. The guys working were really helpful and really friendly. The “Da G.O.A.T.” beans are fantastic - we took some back to Boston with us.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you we are glad you enjoyed coffee with us 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very nice ambiance, good coffee, vegan cookies, bizarrely amazing bathroom. Also, has a balcony and is great for laptopwork."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,They sold me 6 month expired seeped coffee and when I pointed it out they told me that the expiration date was only a suggestion and it was still good. I was really disappointed as I enjoy getting coffee from here but their reaction was unacceptable. If they think this is ok then what else are they doing behind the scenes to cut corners at the expense of the quality. The guy told me that the coffee is actually good for one year and the expiration date is actually a suggestion. Stay away from here if you want quality products.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Lovely coffee shop! This place has it all, friendly staff, lovely interior, a nice outdoor patio, and most importantly, delicious coffee. Highly recommended!."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I love coming here in the mornings, their team is genuine and kind and the coffee is great. I love the calm interior and sweet patio too. Lots of healthy snack options, rather than just pastries. But really I come back for the people. The owner always remembers me and makes time to chat"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much for your business! Our staff is dedicated and always happy to give the best service.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee and a nice brick-lined space to enjoy it. The staff is also friendly and efficient, and the place has a great atmosphere as well as wifi to get a little work done if you need to."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much for your review You are awesome
Sextant Coffee Roasters,A Truly amazing cup of Ethiopian coffee in such a beautiful environment with some of the most sincere and friendly staff that makes me want to come back every single day with a welcoming and warm environment. I really love calling this place a second home / office
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Cozy spot with delicious in house coffee and friendly staff. Wish there is bigger choice of pastries and sweets.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Excellent pour overs, in-house Probat coffee roaster. Cozy atmosphere and fair price for both a cup of coffee and beans!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you for supporting us 😀
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"At the San Francisco Coffee Festival today. The Sextant Coffee people were rude and condescending. They give me a sample that wouldn't be enough for a 2 year old. Asked for a tiny drop of cream, guy puts about 3 ounces in my micro sample. Gives me a super sarcastic phoney apology. Are they trying to sell coffee or annoy people? Based on this experience I won't even bother setting foot in Sextant Coffee Shop."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This coffee shop will receive my five-star rating. Everything went smoothly and without any issues. They always gave it their all and have a high level of customer satisfaction. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend this location! Thank you all so much for your generous assistance. Excellent work!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Best coffee in folsom district
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"- such a cute cafe with great drinks - got the flat white (my usual order) and it was a solid cup of coffee, no latte art though - got one of the pastries, it was decent but forgettable"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank your
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Lovely spot with good in house coffee, friendly staff, plenty of seating and a cool patio."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you Em
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"The café has a nice area atmosphere and very neutral, calming decor."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very cool spot with amazing coffee, fast service, and during Wi-Fi. pretty quiet space, a little dark, but a good place to work. Didn't look for outlets so I don't know about that. I had an Americano and it was flavourful but not aggressive in flavor."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Their coffee quality is amazing. However, there are a few things which have me conflicted about rating the business higher. 1. The cost of a fairly small cup of joe will go about $7 or so. Kinda steep. 2. They open late weekdays (usually 8am; more below). 3. Sometimes they don’t open on time and customers are waiting outside. If you open at 8am you should actually open at 8am.  When I come for coffee I have it planned during my workday, and when you don’t open on time it really sucks. I have had to leave without getting coffee sometimes due to this issue."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Most delicious coffee in San Francisco by far. Excellent!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank so so much
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Semi-regular now at Sextant Coffee, but it’s really hit-or-miss quality. Quality beans and roasting. But ~50% of time I get burnt or scolding hot milk, and bitter/ poor quality espresso. Real shame.  Nice warehouse-style interiors + wifi if you’re looking for a spot to sit with a coffee or do some work."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks for your honest review Nathan. Happy that you still come by and show us love
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This place makes a great 8oz cap. One of my favorites in San Francisco! Highly recommended, its got a cute space as well.  If you are coming up to it northbound on Folsom, it's easy to miss!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Pour over is muddy and $9. Worst 3rd wave coffee in sf
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I drink a lot of coffee, unfortunately I have never come across a latte with such a strange taste. including the excessive price. I will not return…  I also just read the comments of the owner here and it sounds like someone without respect for customers who doesn't take responsibility for mistakes, an excellent recipe for a failed business."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Really well pulled cortado/Gibraltar - barista did a fantastic job getting the milk temp right. Awesome fruity bean made for a heavenly start to Sunday.  The decor/vibe is also great. Def a favorite of mine
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Daniele. Thank you for the great review! So excited that you love our Gibraltar's, It's a in-house favorite for us to."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I like this place but they make you place your own order on a tablet, like McDonalds. It's not quite as annoying as I thought it would be, but it sort of creates an awkward gap between the customer and the server. Do I talk to them? Hard to say. It also makes me want to tip less because I feel like I'm doing work I used to not have to. I wish they would go back to the way it used to be."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Self kiosks were implemented during the pandemic due to labor shortage. We are continuing to use them to let our staff focus on making drinks in addition to adapting to these changing times.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Delicious espresso, Yirgacheffe coffee"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you. You are very kind.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I have tasted many coffees and visited my fair share of Cafes around the world. This one is one of the best! absolute perfection! place is modern, very clean and casual. very comfortable atmosphere. Staff is extremely knowledgeable and very skilled. the coffee is to kill for. Highly recommend!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻 You’re awesome
Sextant Coffee Roasters,The coffee is great and the pretzel sticky buns are killer!  The shop manager runs a good crew.  I highly recommend this coffee shop if ever your in the area.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Not bad coffee. Maybe a bit weak. Nice environment and lots of seating.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Delicious latte and mocha. A bit on the pricey end, but quality of the coffee is there."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you so much
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee and delicious pastries.  Friendly and professional staff.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,They charge an extra dollar for any cream in your coffee. This is the only coffee shop in the city I've ever been to that charges for cream
Sextant Coffee Roasters,We don’t change for cream
Sextant Coffee Roasters,I'll definitely be back. Sextant has delicious coffee with an excellent fruity almost citrusy tang. Friendly service at the counter and nice tables and space to hang out or work.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Glad you enjoy our coffee and space Anthony! Definite confirmation that we are on the right track.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very friendly staff. We could smell the coffee before entering the place. No outlets to plug your computer tho, so if your planning to do some work, be sure to have your computer charged. This is also a great place to read your favorite book."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very good coffee & pain chocolat, also had a brief chat with the owner."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Great industrial space with fresh roasted coffee. Simple coffee menu. Great iced tea.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Thank you so much for the positive review, we appreciate your business!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"If I could post a 0 star review , I would. I came here once and was hoping to use their WiFi which I had called to confirm that they offered earlier . They said they had wi fi so I made my way over. Once I got there , I charged my laptop at an available outlet and was rudely told by an employee that I couldn’t use it and they asked me to unplug while I was on my laptop doing a meeting. I abruptly closed my laptop and ran down the street to find another place to work. Sextant is awful and what is wrong with SF coffee shops ."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Next time you should find a place that rent off space for a day, and so you know we sale coffee not electricity."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Latte was ok. I’m reviewing the whole experience. It’s not personal as you order on a kiosk screen. The bathroom here is awful. It tries to be techy, but it is so annoying to flush, dispense soap and wash your hands."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Lovely neighborhood coffee spot. Old school brick building.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Kenani adamant that his coffee is the best anywhere. On two occasions I tasted a distinct charcoal, burned taste in the Yirgacheff. I mentioned it the first time, however the second time I returned to coffee for another batch. He is very defensive about his coffee. He was accusing me of something being wrong with my taste. The replacemnet batch is okay. However, I will not return to his shop."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,You should not mix our coffee with some cheep coffee so you can reduce your cost may be that Why do you think it’s print
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"OMG..  their ICED MOCHA 😍 Do you like dark chocolate? Do you like good quality coffee? Do you like great service from nice people? Then duh - head straight here! I really can't recommend the mocha enough - we also really like the pizza danish. We love having this coffee shop in the neighborhood and we really commend the the courage, grit and resilience of the owner to continue operating during difficult times such as now (with Covid, vandalism and lack of support for small businesses)."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you Very Much.  This means a lot to me. Tank you For the kind words and the Support!😀
Sextant Coffee Roasters,The shop roast in house with an open toaster that allows bean developing fresh and smooth taste with wonderful nose. This is the finest coffee you will find in the city if you want to feel the taste rather than burn.  Always excellent pull and great pastries. Love it!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 😊
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"It's just a lovely place to have a java. This place really deserved better than five-star stars. All from their employees, interior designers and even facilities was excellent. A spot to keep going back to more and more every time. I strongly recommend this coffee shop to all of you."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Smoothest, most delicious iced Americano I have ever had. If only I weren’t an hour away! Inviting brick interior as well."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Delicious coffee and amazing staff.  This local coffee shop has been my favorite place to safely pick up coffee during the pandemic. I really appreciate the contactless ordering and payment options.  The staff is very helpful and the coffee is delicious as always. I highly recommend the Iced Wired Gandhi.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻 Thank you 😊 you’re awesome
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"They have everything that you need! I highly recommend this shop to all of my friends and family who enjoy coffee as well. Yesterday, I came here and I was so pleased and happy with the overall service. You guys deserve an award indeed! Thanks, guys, for your kindness! Cheers for your accomplishment! The coffee shop is highly recommended!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Gibraltar was foamy, and closer to a cappuccino than a cortado. Wired gandhi was sweeter, and colder."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,thanks 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Top of the line equipment - Black Eagle, Nuova Simoneli. Directly sourced Ethiopian beans. Kinani is humble, passionate about his craft, and cares deeply about his product. I'll definitely be back for more."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks for the kind word=]  Glad to see the appreciation of our equipment and product. Please com back for more!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Best place in the city to find quality, fresh-roasted Ethiopian coffees. Friendly staff is always helping me tweak my coffee recipe. Definitely recommend for someone looking to get into specialty coffee. The Maiden Voyage roast is my personal favorite. It has a sweetness to it that I have yet to find anywhere else in SF."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I have to say these guys are a step-around, as I have witnessed the team members. Good to be around and unpretentious. It's a small shop that grows organically through good service, hard work, and delicious coffee. As well as the Pistachio croissant, the flavor of the Espresso was excellent. We will soon be coming back here again!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"if you're looking for smooth espresso drinks, a couple of delicious light-roast pour overs or tasty pastries, this is the spot. the atmosphere is solid and there is a good amount of seating. the staff have always been friendly with me and their positive attitude shines through in their work. the yirgacheffe pour over is worth the wait."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Devo, thank you for spending your time at our shop and for the great review. You are always welcome here! P.s the espresso really is smooth=]"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"GREAT service. These are nice people who make a great cup of coffee. It may not be dirt cheap, but the atmosphere is nice and you know what, they care about your experience. They are very friendly. The coffee tastes good and the people make me want to come back. I'll glady pay an extra buck for a latte if it means the people look like they're enjoying themselves and happy that you are there. Thanks Sextant, I'll be returning."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"The Cappuccino or the Flat White or the Quick drip coffee or the Wired Gandhi paired with the chocolate croissant – pure joy! It doesn’t really matter what you get, its all excellent. Sextant is definitely one of my all time favorite coffee roasters in San Francisco."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻 you are awesome
Sextant Coffee Roasters,I came here to work during a weekday and the place has really good work vibes since it’s a little bit dimly lit but quiet and comfy! It gives off homey vibes to me and is a good place to chill with your work in a group or alone! I couldn’t find any outlets so that’s my one complaint. They also have amazing bathrooms that are so high tech you need a receipt to enter and use a QR code to get in!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Glad you enjoyed your experience and were able to get work done in our space:)
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Rona, Miguel and Sophia were working at the counter.  I have been getting my favorite drink(Gibraltar) daily for a while.  Sextant is my best artisan coffee joint in the neighborhood!  Thank you so much!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextant is an absolute treasure, and I hesitated before giving it a review because I feel like it’s a closely guarded San Francisco secret.   Then I realized almost 500 other people have given it a review, so I figured the secret's out already.  We’ve frequently visited Sightglass, The Mill, David Rio, and a bunch of other spots, but we ALWAYS find ourselves coming back to Sextant, even when it’s out of the way. From their drip coffee to their cappuccinos and lattes, nothing compares. We've also started stocking their in-house roasted beans in our office and at home.  They offer the traditional range of beverages, but they focus on coffee FIRST — not overly sweetened coffee products you’d expect at Starbucks that often mask the the burnt flavor of other beans.  Our current favorite is a flat white with oat milk with one of their carrot cake muffins. It’s only a matter of time before the FDA officially declares this unbeatable combination as chemically addictive, but until then, I’m going as much as I can.  If you’re into high quality coffee, or you’re interested in tasting the difference between “okay” and “mind-blowingly good”, check out Sextant Coffee Roasters."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻 You are awesome 😎
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"If you're driving, there's parking around here for 1 hour.  The vibe here was great, and I would say that their coffee and baked goods were awesome too! If you're deciding to work here, I would say that it's not the best place just because the outside noise seeps in the coffee shop easily and the music was playing quite loud. It's a great place for socializing, though!  Oh, and the baristas were friendly and engaging to the customers!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"HI Aj, next time we will try to to earn more stars from your by providing you even better Experience thank you for the review"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"When I bought packets of coffee to carry around, he even helped out. The members of the team were both polite and accommodative. While waiting for my ground coffee, I enjoyed looking at their award plaques, which reminded me of my barista years a long time ago. I so love it! It's worth the money!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Good Ethiopian coffee featured here for their delicious coffees and coffee blends. Now only takeout or delivery but when it's good again definitely linger by one of the tables and enjoy your favorites along one of the pastries while you work on your laptop.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This cute coffee shop doesn't have all the displays, snacks, and pastries of a Starbucks.  They make a good cup of coffee and I had a really delicious chocolate croissant here.  I like that my coffee was served in a real cup and my pastry on a plate.  They have their big roaster in the back, giving this place a really homey feel."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,The iced latte is nice! Made with the Maiden Voyage coffee beans. I can taste the caramel sweetness and the slight fruity notes.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Their coffee is so on point!  These guys have state-of-the-art brewing technology and devices, so every espresso pull comes out perfectly.   The staff are amazingly passionate about their craft, and highly knowledgeable.  Spark up a conversation with them and you'll find a demeanor far from snooty and uptight.  They also roast in this small location.  The outside sitting area is a plus, given most cafes don't seem to have one.  The inside seating is inviting, and seems like an okay place to post up for a short-while and work.  Never too busy there, from the times I went."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"The basics on Sextant Coffee Roasters: 1. It's not the most exciting coffee shop, but that might be exactly what you're looking for. 2. The place serves exclusively Ethiopian Coffee, which is great by me. 3. The beans are roasted on site. 4. A bag of beans to go is extremely reasonable. 5. The pour overs are outstanding, the lattes above average. 6. There's plenty of street parking. 7. It's a fine place to get some work done, not a whole lot of action. 8. It's your basic 3rd wave shop serving really good coffee."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"No clue how to make a Mocha,Maybe they do some other drink better? Maybe I just don't like Ethiopian coffee?  I rarely leave a bad/fair  review  because It's not cool,  but it was really bad and over priced.  I would still say to check them out and see what you think."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,We are serving the community in a pandemic putting our life in the line and bing short staffed. We do know how to make an amazing Mocha! Have a great day
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Stumbled across this coffee shop while in the area and it’s by far one of the best cafes in SF! Coffee was delicious, lots of seating, good vibes, and the baristas were so friendly & kind!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Best coffee ever. Incredibly easy to place your order when you get there with the self ordering and checkout system.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I had an excellent latte here early on a Friday morning. The cafe is vast and has a lot of character, with beautiful red brick walls. They seem to have an outdoor patio at the back. Service was super friendly too."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,We passed thru SF on our way to LA and chose this place because it had good reviews. Unfortunately my partner’s latte tasted like hot water and we were left scratching our heads as to why someone would charge $8-$10 for watered down 12 ounce coffee. Was disappointed to say the least.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"The absolute best Ethiopian roasts I’ve had in the Bay Area, beautiful espresso and great care as well. Excellent customer service, a true hidden gem."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you! We greatly appreciate your words of positivity! you are awesome 👏
Sextant Coffee Roasters,A horrible customer service employee was rude and said he wanted to close early while hours showed open until 3:00 pm.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Sorry about your experience but we had emergency with one of our staff and for safety of our customers and our staff we had to close earlier.  Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Today was my first time at Sextant. The screaming hot weather asked for a cool coffee refreshment. I chose the iced mocha and I was astounded. This was without a doubt the best I've ever had! Chapeau :) Can't wait to taste their other coffees!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextant is a diamond in the rough! This is my favorite spot in SoMa for coffee - the layout and atmosphere of the spot is relaxing and the coffee is delicious. Everyone working here is so polite and professional, and know their craft. Personally love the Yirgacheffe and their espresso as well."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Thank you for the kind words, and we appreciate you."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextant is a beautiful little coffee shop with delicious award winning coffee. When I go home I like to bring it back with me for my parents because they really like it, and also like to laugh at me for how much I paid for it. It's worth it, though. This place is also great to hang out in, and they generally have some good pastries. Some of the drink such as the dirty chai (I think they call it a Wired Ghandi here) tea/espresso drinks are uniquely delicious. There's a little back patio also in case you want to catch some sun."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Rebecca we are so happy that you love our coffee just as much as we do. I'm sure you know but we take great pride In roasting our coffee, And the fact that you not only drink our coffee but actually take time out of your day to buy and share it with your loved ones Is what keeps us going forward. Thank you for the kind review we truly appreciated.=]"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Great cafe with a well-balanced decor, vibe and busy-ness. The atmosphere is open and bright. There's an outdoor area in the back, well suited for SF's consistently moderate weather. The coffee is roasted in-house and the results are evident to the palate. Wifi connection is strong even during primetime. And there's a somewhat automated bathroom to remind you you're still in SF."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I just got a cup of latte from this place (around 3 pm on sat 03/06). I walked back to the car (parked 10 seconds away), put it in the secured cup holder, got home in less than 10 min, opened the lid, and there was absolutely no foam in the cup!!! I’ve gotten latte from various places and took more than 10 minutes for me to get home and never opened the cup with absolutely no foam in it. I could have made a better cup myself and I’ve only made one in my life!  **In response to the owner's response below: Maybe I don't know the proper word for the stuff on top of latte (maybe it's frothed milk), but it doesn't look like the frothed milk was made properly if that's the correct term. If I just look at ALL the latte pictures of your shop posted on Google review, I don't see one picture that looks like mine! I would have asked for another cup but it was given to me with the lid already on it."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Just for your information latte is made with no foam. If foam is what you wanted you could have ordered cappuccino. And also if you wanted foam in your cup you could have easily asked for it and we would have been glad to make it for you Hope you have a great day!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Overpriced coffee. The place seems it is still under construction. Music is too high to work there and 5 minutes after taking a sit, we were told the shop had to close and we were asked to leave at noon."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,We hade an emergency with one of our staff and for the safety of our customers and our staff we hade to close early  Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I am one of this coffee shop's faithful clients. And I'm not only a fan of coffee, but I especially enjoy their coffee and facilities. I will stay with my coffee and laptop for a whole day, and all this is permitted there. And that made me more at ease!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Tried this coffee place at the SF coffee festival, it was so good I had to drive to the city and have it again. I tried a Gibraltar (cant remember the exact and it was so delicious! If you are feeling indulgent, get the affagato. Sooooo yummy combined with the richness of the espresso."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This is the best coffee in San Francisco. I’ve been to Ethiopia and it’s the only place with coffee that actually tastes like you’re there. Plus, the owner is amazing - super kind and welcoming!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much. You are Mach appreciated.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"You were the oasis to my parched desert, A shelter in the dry land, A covert from the wild beasts, A crimson flower in the arid landscape, A blanket in the icy nights, A chill in the sweltering heat, A shining star in the endless night sky.  - Poem I found online but I'm pretty sure it's about Sextant Coffee Roasters"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Ha ha  that was amazing 😀 Thank you very much You are awesome
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"This place has great coffee, the place is well lit and clean. The employees are always very nice. I think I have had to form a line one time. I've never been there during those early morning rushes."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Sextant Coffee is another coffee spot in the SOMA area of San Francisco. The best thing about Sextant is their atmosphere. Just an awesome space overall to enjoy a coffee and possible get some work done (or just people watch). The prices are average for the area and the coffee is decent.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Best latte in the city! The wired Gandhi (dirty chai) is also delicious. Friendly staff and great apparel, really can’t go wrong here!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,I got an iced latte. The coffee was top notch. The folks working were really fantastic and handled the massive lines from Folsom street fair with poise and professionalism.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextant is great for a quiet conversation on the back patio in good weather. Mainly I go for the espresso drinks. The roasting quality is very high, compare with Sightglass and Four Barrel. The ambiance is quite pleasant, too, with wood tables and pleasant unobtrusive background music. My only quibble: the wifi is somewhat weak on the back patio."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Best tasting gourmet coffee I’ve had in San Francisco. There are many overpriced overhyped coffee places such as st frank and blue bottle but in my view this is best in Bay Area. Nothing matches the coffees of Europe and South America but in sf Bay Area this is best I’ve tasted !
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks a million 🙏🏻
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee, free wifi, and lot's of seating space to have a meeting or plant yourself for a few hours of solo work. Very pleasant outdoor patio space in the back for warm days. Only one bathroom though, so can be a bit awkward when it's crowded."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Came here on the suggestion of a friend, after a group of us grabbed brunch nearby at Azucar, and ordered myself an ice latte, which, if you can trust the taste of a man who only drinks coffee once every couple months, was enjoyable.  The space itself was pretty empty, but neat in that modern warehouse-ish way that SoMa often is. Nice place to chill and lounge with friends or to get some work done, if you're in the area.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - Super spacious, plenty of seating, with nothing that should pose an accessibility issue.  Bathroom - From what I remember, their bathrooms were down a flight of steps, which is not the best thing when you're at a venue that's meant to fill your bladder!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Hey Johnny Wang, thanks for your review! We can assure you however that our bathrooms are at ground level. No accessibility issues here!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Great coffee and great place! Also try their roasts for home, esp. Love Dancing Goat 🐐🐐 …"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,The best latte I ever had.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextan Coffee Roasters is by far the best tasting coffee in San Francisco. It’s specialty coffee at its best and the owner is a very nice and friendly person. The vibe inside Sextan is trendy, yet very comfortable and welcoming . Once you try their capuchinos, Mocha or Ethiopian drip, you will be hooked!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much Robert
Sextant Coffee Roasters,coffee is good but their menu is weird and not intuitive to understand what’s what
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Nice hipster style coffee shop.  My only complaint is that while sitting at the bar counter they brought my coffee (a nice pour over) to their ""come pick up your coffee"" area instead of directly to me.  Not a big deal but it wasn't busy and they seemed to recognize me."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Not always the friendliest service (though often it's good). Espresso drinks are decent. Not sure why an almond milk latte is $6, though. Sightglass is better and less expensive."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Thanks for the review Eric, always good to get feedback from customers like you. Our almond milk cost more because of the brand we carry, its pricier than the competitors milk choice if that helps clarify things. You are always welcome here =]"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Great coffee shop on Folsom. They have an outdoor patio which is great on a warm day. Coffee is pretty good as well. I would place it in the top tier of coffee roasters in San Francisco.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Love this place.  Friendly staff, great coffee, excellent cappuccinos/lattes and always observes safety and social distancing protocols. Has been oasis in the pandemic!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you 🙏🏻 we appreciate you!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Reasonable prices for the area. Some of the best extracted espresso I've had. Supplying sparkling water with espresso based drink is a classy touch and the decor is rustic and friendly.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Second time to visit for important meetings. Space for private conversations. Great location on Folsom st. Don't miss the high tech bathroom. And lastly great coffee.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks for the great review Philip!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I went there twice, and definitely will go there more. The owner and the staff are amazing and their coffee is really good"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I ordered a drip coffee. 10 people ordered espresso drinks after me. They didn't begin to make my drink until after they served all 10 of the espresso customers that arrived after me. The coffee tasted good, on par with Philz but unfortunately it was only luke warm."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextant Roasters is Good2Go! Delicious coffee, cool cafe and patio, great staff and they are committed to a great customer experience.  Check out their cool high-tech restroom."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Tried making me sign a touch screen in order to complete a transaction. Was rude when I wanted another option after realizing the Barista was going to make me touch a hard surface people had been putting their hands on all day long... hundreds of people. Not the best practice when trying to mitigate risk of infectious disease spread.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"It is unfortunate, time like this we should work together. Here at Sextant Coffee Roasting, we are taking all the safety Majors including providing sanitizer to our customers, and sanitizing surfaces every 30 minutes Unfortunately with square pos system if you are paying with a credit card you have to finish the transaction. Then you can use the had sinister."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Their iced lattes are very good!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"As a coffee addict, this is the perfect place to spend time with friends talking over a cup of coffee. All had a strong and enjoyable flavor. I recommend this position quite highly."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Fabulous neighborhood gem featuring exceptionally delicious coffees, hot chocolate & other beverages made with highest quality ingredients and professional, attentive service. My friends and I are looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Good vibes here and really like their Jostel Ghandi (dirty chai). The baristas are all great at latte art. Coffee tends to get sour if it sits for too long and can be pricey for a small cup
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Great coffee and amazing service. Such a wholesome neighborhood coffee place. My favorite order is their mocha and a danish. Their mocha is to die for.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Thank you Pranav, you are awesome!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Fresh roasted coffee beans suffuse Sextant Coffee Roasters. The owner is from the land of coffee and imports the finest coffee beans to make a most delectable brew. If you desire uncompromised quality coffee, you will find it here."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Mark! Thank you for the kind words! We like to pride ourselves on the coffee selection we carry.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,They have the strangest bathroom arrangement that requires either a phone app or a QR code.  Talk of living in the SV bubble!  The coffee was good.  Washing your hands was more complicated than it needs to be.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Sextant's a quiet craft coffeehouse. They know their way around an espresso machine. If you're in the neighborhood and need your fix, I don't think you'll be disappointed by a stop at Sextant."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"I got both Ethiopian whole beans Yirgacheffe Heirloom and Kochere. Both are amazing but if you are making your own coffee,  I would go with Yirgacheffe Heirloom  + Friendly staff"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much 👍🏼
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"A hidden coffee shop in Soma, that you're lucky to stumble across. Incredibly good coffee. Decent amount of seating for two people. The snack / pastry options are limited."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Great coffee here. Not in the best of places but worth the trip. Nice spot to sit inside or out. Near Costco and other  grocery stores.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,My go to spot for my cup of Joe! This place provides one of the most incredible coffee in the city!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you Joe

Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Really good coffee. Nice owner and staff. Sometimes has prepared food bowls that have made my day.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Excellent coffee in the area without the long wait of sightglass coffee or blue bottle. The inside seems like a really nice place to set up your laptop and work
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, hilarious touch-free bathroom (only in SF). This is yet another wonderful local small batch roaster, if you are into that sort of thing, which I am."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Nice place Awesome seating But shy on outlets Good wifi Exemplary staff Small roaster of premium beans that you pay a premium price on ( I'd stick with sipping a fine cup of espresso and purchase beans elsewhere as they're a little higher than market price, but a lot of boutique roasters are falling in line with high priced small roast coffees) Definitely try and check it out if you're wandering around SoMa"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,One of the best coffees in the area. Very friendly baristas.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Fantastic atmosphere. Easy to find. Killer coffee and reasonable prices for the quality of coffee.  Solid spot, worth visiting."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Airy spot to read without distraction. A back patio for those sunny days. Not fantastic for people watching as the storefront is sort of compact, it's much more long than wide."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"swung by this shop this morning for a latte -- super friendly service and a delicious drink. very nice, 10/10."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Great place with friendly staff!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks 
Sextant Coffee Roasters,The barista was a great personality and easy to talk to. She helped us find what we wanted and set the tone of what Sextant wants their culture to be.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Very well poured lates and amazing beans. The Yirgacheffe beans make it basically impossible to say no to a second cup in the afternoon. So gooooood!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very Much!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,This place has the best coffee I have ever had and the place itself has so much character.the owner was one of the most generous people I have ever met and so were the employees.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"A very SF coffee place with quality drinks, nice stuff and a comfortable atmosphere. If you don't mind a $3.00 espresso shot you'll be comfortable here!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Normally very good coffee. I've only not enjoyed my cup a couple times. It's a joy to work from there every Friday.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Stopped in at random, as I happened to be walking past. Delicious espresso, with a bright clean taste and a lovely sweet finish. Nice clean interior."

Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you very much just FYI San Francisco is a very costly city and we want to make sure  we can take care of our team.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Fantastic. The pastries made at home are also fantastic. I LOVE it here. You can't wait to get back soon.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"The coffee was good but the barista was rude, impolite and full of attitudes. Tried to ask her about the WiFi and she was extremely unhelpful."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,We apologize for your experience. We hope your next visit will be 10x better!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee, but not as good as Sightglass down the street. The place is very clean and updated though, which was nice."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Best Chai tea I've every tasted. The wired Ghandi adds a kick with a shot of espresso.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Good coffee and snacks, and very nice service. Parking is tricky, though."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thank you

Sextant Coffee Roasters,"Very bad experience with this cafe. We ordered 2 drinks 10 minutes before the establishment closed. The waitress did not mention it before placing an order... then pressure from the staff to empty the premises. So, I advise against it."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Our hours of operation is posted and also it is online and the staff need to finish and closing shop. may be next time should plan on coming earlier to have a more pleasant experience.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,"There are many people, need to wait. But still quite tasty. I ordered a hot latte and the ratio of milk to coffee was just right. Some pastries, but not many items when I came. There are also some indoor and outdoor seats, where you can sit and enjoy coffee time."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Coffee was a unique taste that seems to be divided. It feels sour.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,Thanks
