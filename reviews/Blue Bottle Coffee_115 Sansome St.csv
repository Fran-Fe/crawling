Blue Bottle Coffee,blue bottle 🔛🔝! coffee was as good as i expected :>> would drink again even in other  bb branches :>>
Blue Bottle Coffee,I would like to start by saying that Saturday is really busy in the Ferry building. But the thing with this location is that on saturdays you can also enjoy the farmers market here. So the staff here is very kind. You can order ahead on your phone. I ordered latte and waffle. The latte was very good and they use oatly oat milk. They also sell merchandise. In terms of seating you can find locations to sit around the ferry building.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Still a great place for coffee, but the main branch is the most delicious. Go to the main branch!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I had the hot chocolate with regular milk. It was delicious, perfect for a crisp SF evening. Delicious 😋 The staff is very quick with the turnaround. You will get your beverage quickly. The range of milk options is awesome. I will be going back for more !!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, great staff. I often grab a cup of coffee here before I start my pleasant walk towards Fisherman's Wharf."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Came here for quick coffee to enjoy the sunny outdoors. Ordered the coffee float and it was absolutely delicious. For $6.50, the size was def small even though they call it large. I know this is SF but come on. Maybe they only looking for specific clientele. Apart from the size issue, the coffee was perfectly cold and ice cream (butterscotch) was creamy and nutty. Will def come back if ever in the area."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best to use app to order. Very busy location. Always delicious. Don’t forget about the location at the entrance to the ferry building. Fantastic staff!
Blue Bottle Coffee,You gotta try the hot Nola at Blue Bottle Coffee at The Ferry Building!! My wife got the Cafe Mocha (pictured) and the barista made a pretty cool design with the froth. Excellent place to grab a cup!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Pricey but delicious cardamom latte. A nice spot to grab a beverage as you explore the ferry building.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, came back here just to grab a cup a coffee and enjoy the outdoor view"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Service was top notch with great recommendations! Fast moving and courteous staff,  a smile really goes a long way!  Great coffee!! Ask for the, Soy Gibraltar!! It's a vegan coffee that will blow your socks off! It's not on the menu but they'll gladly make it for you and it is delicious!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The treats were most with the right consistency and sugar. No GF options here.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Fast friendly service! Strong, cold iced coffees! It's also a great location, and the staff do a good job keeping their area clean. Definitely a good stop. Blue Bottle, made dad hats with your signature blue bottle logo front and center! That's all 😌 …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,New Orleans coffee wasn't not that great though I liked their styles.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Ok. So they have this ""drink"" called affogato - it's basically ice cream with espresso poured over it served in a bowl. I have dreams about it still!! It was the most delicious coffee ""drink"" I have ever had. Brown butter ice cream with blue bottles espresso which is amazing on its own and it was just the most interesting bowl of ice cream/espresso I have tasted."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"First Blue bottle shop I've visited and still my favorite.  Many great memories coming here, such a solid staff that make great cups of coffee consistently."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Update: Great and improved service, I not sure what they did, but the speed of service has improved and the quality is consistent for the past several months. I am pretty much here every weekend.  Old review:  The service is a little slow at this location due to high traffic, and I do think that the quality does suffer. I got the waffle and it’s like half of the waffle is gone ... the coffee isn’t as strong and consistent as other bluebottle location."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Dan, thanks for leaving this review! We would love to get more information about your visit, feel free to email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com if we can help!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I had the winter seasonal blend, great fruity taste. Drip takes a bit of time so patience is necessary when lines are long. There are two blue bottles at the ferry terminal, the one inside is bigger."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Baristas were super friendly and helpful even with a long line. We went during lunchtime so while it was busy, it’s nothing like Saturday morning market. They didn’t seem to rush anyone with ordering. We got our coffee pretty quickly and it was great."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle was introduced to me in NYC, but I knew them as an Oakland company. The coffee did not disappoint. Delicious cortado that I forgot to get a picture of the prefect pour because I sipped it first."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"We tried the Cafe Latte here and found it significantly superior to the Latte at Starbucks. The coffee is slightly expensive though. You get only one size for $5, other local charges add another 20 cents to the bill.  If you are like me, and buy coffee from a cafe once in a while, then the price hike justifies the experience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,$8 for a 8 Oz cup of mocha with almond milk is the most I've paid so far in SF.  Went to this place because at 5pm on a sunday all the other places at the Ferry building were shut. So if you want a coffee after 3pm this is one place you can go.  Nice to sit in the seating area nearby and enjoy the view of the bay. Or if you're brave enough you can sit outside with the wind.  The coffee tastes OK.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Small Blue Bottle stand with all the usuals. Great place to grab a coffee to go 🙏🏼 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I absolutely love the coffee here. It's nice and simple, but so creamy and not bitter at all. Their cold brew is nice and strong, not to bitter, and their ice latte was very creamy, and not bitter at all, but the coffee taste was still there. Honestly I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but the coffee here is always amazing."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"More on the expensive side, however the coffee wasnt bad."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Super helpful staff! I dropped my coffee and Connor, a helpful barista, resent my order free of charge! Thanks team!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"very good coffee… but, you know…… there’s just somethin’…… hmmmmm….🧐"
Blue Bottle Coffee,As delicious as ever. I recommend a pour over but friend tell me their espresso is also great and when it’s too hot to even consider hot coffee there’s great iced or cold brew to enjoy.
Blue Bottle Coffee,no place to sit but plenty of standing areas or sit outside along the benches. coffee's standard.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"fantastic barista! He gave me a sample of the new menu item as I wasn't sure if I would like it, I'm glad I got the sample as I didn't like it. I ended up getting the Louisiana iced coffee and it tasted delicious."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Top 3 spots for coffee in San Francisco! Whenever I'm around at embarcadero, I make sure I grab a cup!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really nice coffee spot in the Ferry terminal, but $6+ for a Latte or Cap is a bit ridiculous. It’s not THAT good.  The foam art might be the best part!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Pretty good coffee but small portions, no sugar free syrup options, and the staff were unwelcoming. Good spot if you want a bright space with natural light and decent espresso, but if you're looking for a warm/kind/welcoming vibe, this isn't the place."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I’ve been coming here since they opened and have always had great experiences. I moved away a 7 years ago and have been back a handful of times since—still great. This time however, quality control and customer service have clearly gone awry.  Two days ago my partner got a tea and it was great. Came back the next day and got the same tea, but the water was lukewarm at best. When we asked if we could have a new tea that was hot, I was told the water that is dispensed is always the same temperature. I said, regardless, the tea was still just warm at best, and the cashier said “I can’t explain the water temperature beyond how I just did.” Zero effort to make it right.  Sad to see a once great institution fall by the wayside."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your tea, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,My hobbie the SF trip was to rate Blue bottle coffee because we do not have any at home lol. I can't get enough of this place everything they make is great. We had a match and a latte the first stop and on the second stop we had Louisiana style ice coffe and and omg all times this place had a line and everything time it was great.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"We wanted to see if they had affogato (ice cream in a shot of espresso) and even though the menu didn't list it, they had it. It came with two scoops of ice cream and was delicious. They even went out of their way to get us buttons."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I ordered one cup of latte coffee, ohh my god, put 4/5 milk inside latte coffee, unbelievable! So you can imagine when you taste, absolutely just like milk. I am very very upset. No more order again!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,a busy place for blue bottle coffee as same as the others locations in the bay area. cold brew here is very authentic as just perfect as its other hot brews. lemon yuzu fizz is refreshing but this time tastes a little over sour.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The $7.80 cup of New Orleans coffee wasn’t made well, asked for almond milk in drink and literally just tasted like a cup of almond milk. Caffeine was one of the lowest I’ve ever had in a coffee, still felt tired after. Also no prices listed at all for their whole menu. Blue bottle truly destroys the SF experience, was a very unhappy person drinking my $7.80 16oz of coffee. Blue bottle brought a frown to my face. Please avoid this awful company if you would like to have a nice time in SF."

Blue Bottle Coffee,"After more than a decade living in Melbourne, AU I really appreciate great coffee. And great coffee is actually hard to find in the US. But lattes served at Blue Bottle can rival the best Richmond coffee shops in Melbourne. Yes, quite expensive - around $5 for a latte (and it looks like they only have cup size) but it's worth it. Additionally Blue Bottle makes amazing Belgium waffles - also highly recommended. It is network, so you can find them in multiple locations. I have seen the ones in Alameda, Palo Alto, Stanford and Santana Row and they all served high quality coffee"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Hit or miss in the quality. Revising review after having a terrible cappuccino
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Thanks for sharing this, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com "
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I don’t know if the coffee is good or the waffles are to die for. And most likely never will. What I do know is if you’re going to charge me over 4 bucks for a water you could at least hand it to me instead of telling me to get it myself and call me boss and then smirk when I don’t tip you a dollar…but maybe Im a crank, you can go find out for yourself."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Jack, sorry to hear you had such an experience at our cafe. Please reach out to support@bluebottlecoffee.com for further assistance. Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,It was crowded but the staff works pretty fast. The waffle was really delicious!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Very bold flavour with smooth taste! Excellent pairing with the cupcakes at the bakery across the way.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Best decaf lattes and mochas ever. You might pause to wonder: Is my hard work, kind heart or simply living in this universe worth a $5 latte? A $6 mocha? Blue Bottle believes so --- and consistently delivers. Today's latte made my week."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Barista is really friendly and coffee is okay but not my type.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The coffee taste great, and also the clerks are very friendly too. When you went to San Francisco , must buy coffee in here ~"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle never seems to disappoint. We first had it down in Venice and since then we've been hooked. The staff was super friendly, the place was super clean and the coffee tasted amazing. I would like to emphasize that I absolutely love their choice of cow's milk, hands down I think it's the best I've had in a while. I'm not sure if they source it locally or not, but it tasted awesome"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This cafe chain is pretty much over hyped. I was extremely disappointed with an espresso which was very bitter, acidic and had no aroma at all. We also got a cappuccino and it tasted as if the barista covered the quality of the coffee beans with a frothy milk. And I saw Blue Bottle featured in the documentary about coffee! Unbelievable."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving a review! We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Service was quick and coffee was also really good. Would recommend a stop if you’re in the ferry building!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Coffee is average, but what was more troubling was the way they served us water. Server had no gloves and had fingers in cup where water was poured. I saw them use the tap and switch it to hot to fill up the hot water cup, instead of using the kettle... not impressed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The Barista is not friendly here. The coffee was good. But not the best.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Linda, thanks for your feedback. We'd love to get more information about your experience, please feel free to reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com for further assistance."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Not as good as it used to be. The coffee is burnt and mediocre, despite costing $9. Bring back the Slocombe + Single Origin Affogato!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"My favorite coffee place in the world has an awesome SF location right in the ferry terminal on the water. The location is small, but is easily accessible to the great space out on the pier with great views. The lattes are just as good here as larger locations and service is quick and friendly. For a quick coffee, this is the perfect spot."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The coffee is very delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Reasonable wait for a coffee shop. The prices feel like a lot, but as somebody who is used to getting a non-dairy up charge, it was nice to have that included in the price instead :) Thank you to the baristas!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle is a great place to visit because they truly care about each cup of coffee that they make.  It takes a pretty long time for them to make each cup, but for coffee lovers, the quality definitely shines through.  My fiance got a latte and I got a hot chocolate (I'm not a huge coffee fan except for Philz Coffee!) and both were great.  I love the attention they pay to the details.  My hot chocolate had the most beautiful milk heart ""drawn"" on it.  I recommend stopping by if you are looking for a coffee experience that deviates from the typical Starbucks experience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The most amazing coffee I have ever had. I absolutely love Blue Bottle's coffee. Their coffee is sensational. Very delicious. Even though there is usually a long line here, I think their coffee is always worth the wait.  The Ferry Building always has the best of SF's finest. This location is also the best I have had so far.  Their New Orleans Iced Coffee is my favorite, but all of their drinks are amazing."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee as usual. However, the customer service experience has significantly decreased. Is not what it once was. It used to be attentive, correct in the orders, friendly. I understand is more of a tourist location which for that reason should be even better than was it was back in 2011!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Let me preface this review by saying one thing: I am not a coffee drinker. I never drink coffee. Like ever. I don't mind the aromas and flavors of coffee, but I'd much rather have iced tea instead.  With that said, I was absolutely amazed at how awesome Blue Bottle's New Orleans iced coffee was. I was able to have it nearly every single day, for about a week, for breakfast after getting off the Larkspur ferry and looked forward to it every single time.  With that said, the lines are very long and the service is a bit slow. But then again the reason the line is so long is because it's so good. I'm definitely a fan and can only hope that this small chain expands into Boston at some point in my lifetime so I can get more of that delicious drink.  As far as service goes, they're friendly and pretty quick. The stand itself doesn't offer much besides coffee and a few coffee-themed knick knacks. There's a few pastries available but nothing that great or worthwhile. There's no seating on the premise either, but you should be able to snag a spot around the Ferry Building if you walk around."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee spot. Well worth the lines that form. They have 3 locations in the ferry building. 1 outside in front and 2 together inside. Coffees are tasty. Hot chocolate is made from chocolate you can purchase melted Ruth hot milk. Pricier then Starbucks but well worth it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Expensive, long wait.  One of my colleagues was really into this place, so we'd go once in a while.  The coffee was usually pretty good, but not worth all the hassle for me.  He really liked these single-origin beans that had notes of lemon and tobacco and all this crazy stuff, so if that's your bag you might be really into this place!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"A wonderful little coffee shop. It is one of the places I miss in San Francisco where we would grab coffee on the weekend (pre pandemic) before enjoying a stroll down the promenade. The staff friendly, efficient and never made you felt rushed. The wait is worthwhile!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I went to Blue Bottle Coffee a couple of weeks ago, and I experienced horrible service.  First off, the cashier told me they only accept credit cards and then was surprised that I had a credit card.  I know it was because I am African American.   Then I had to wait for a long time for my order that tasted like garbage. I know that a couple of decent people left once they heard me complain to the manager.  I will never go there again nor will I spend my money at THAT horrible ferry building."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Peggy, thanks for leaving a review, we're so sorry to hear this. We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nevers go back again. First and last Time . We  were waiting twenty minute , and we didn'r recieve our order . Their only excuse was :  our machine IS broken . And they can't telle us if somebedy took our order by mistake. We regret to Lost 10 dollars with 2 dollars tips . Satisfactions's  Customers are their last intest"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! Thanks for leaving this review -- we'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I went there right after a very long trip and was exhausted but the guys there were very patient with me and helpful. Oh and the cappuccino was pretty good too.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Is the coffee good? I do not know. What I know is that first I had to wait ages to order. Then ordered sparkling water, two croissants, one latte and one cappuccino. Then waited for the coffee. Guess what? They did not take the order correctly. Just asked us to wait until they’d solve the problem. Solving the problem for them is having one wait until he dies.... never ever am I going to buy something from them. That was unprofessionnal  and rude."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Olivier-Antoine, thanks for leaving a review. We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nah, nearly $6 for a quad shot? Big chain with big prices. Coffee is meh. Also owned by the Nestle brand which is cool if you're into killing babies. Just go to Red Bay or project diaz around the corner for something locally owned"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for sharing this feedback about your quad shot. We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I am from out of town and have a very interesting view on coffee. This place is located in a tourist trap with very long lines. In addition to that if you aren't listening you can miss your coffee order. That being said the coffee at this place was fantastic!!! Great full rich smooth flavor. In addition to that a very attractive and attentive staff. Helpful tip there is a full service window around the corner so if there is a long wait step around the corner and order. Overall very, very good well worth the hassle."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I give it a 5 star for customer service and a two star for taste. This was my first time trying blue bottle coffee and it may have just been a fluke, but the espresso was really bad. It had no crema, was really thin in texture, was only bitter and was less intense than what I can make at home with a mokapot or pressurized porta filter. Maybe I just had bad luck"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Lucas, thanks for leaving a review! We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Small but meaningful Because it is 1st blue bottle
Blue Bottle Coffee,"1. Came over to a front, got “onesec” answer from barista and then she turned her back to me for 2 minutes until she finished whatever she was doing. 2. Ordered medium size poor-over with(!) milk, paid $5.72(including tips I think) 3. Waited for about 7 minutes(!) to pick up a coffee. 4. Once I’ve got far enough and made a first sip, I discovered the coffee with no(!) milk :) 5. I counted at least 3 people who is doing coffee in the spot + 1 cleaning person.  Try to be objective in description, so people can judge themselves.  But my 2 stars are obviously subjective. No more Blue Bottle Coffee for me."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Roman, thanks for leaving a review! We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This is absolutely the best coffee I've ever had in my life.  If you've been deterred by the length of the line, I STRONGLY recommend trying it at least once.  Also, during the Saturday Farmer's Market they sell at two additional locations outside.  You can try one of those if the indoor line is too intimidating.  My favorite drink is the New Orleans iced coffee.  Get it with whole milk like they recommend and soy makes it awful, just warning you.  The plain drip is awesome too.  As far as beans, I buy ""Three Africans"".  Everything I've had has been excellent.  This stuff is definitely expensive, but worth it.  EDIT:  There are no longer two additional farmer's market stands outside but there is now an additional permanent store in the front of the building."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"From the moment we got here the vibe was sad. And The service was terrible. We tried to ask questions about their different menu and they were ignorant and rude not wanting to answer. We finally got our drinks and the cup was a little over half way full. They forgot one of our drinks and the drinks we got were flavorless. It’s sad because we could of just walked to Starbucks and got better service, better drinks in a happier atmosphere. Point blank just do your job and if your unhappy with your life don’t take it out on other people and do something about it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Thanks for sharing this - we'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I have to admit, this coffee is amazing!  I personally do not like the hype that this coffee spot gets but if I was just to rate the coffee it would be a 8.5/10.  A major downside is that this place is located in the Ferry building so it is always packed!!!! I am not the biggest fan of waiting in line for coffee so I rarely go here.  But if you want a quality cup of joe and have never experienced blue bottle, stop by."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Probably the best coffee in town. You can't go wrong with an americano or latte. Their waffles are great too, and don't forget to pick up some freshly roasted beans.  This location is always busy. Tip, there are two windows! If you want faster service it's always worth checking the one on the side, as the line there is often much, much shorter."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The coffee was phenomenal. We got the New Orleans, espresso, and mocha. All were lovely."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Wonderful location. Delicious coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,As cool as coffee gets. If you get the chance actually speak with the baristas and get them to recommend a good pour over. These guys are passionate about it so let them lead you. I still think that the BB Coffee book is my all time favourite book on coffee. You can buy it there!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Blue bottle coffee is great. Definitely stop by for a flat white here. Love the branding too.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The queue here can get rather long, especially since it's located at a tourist / local attraction. Saturday mornings can be especially bad given that the local farmer's market is also ongoing. They have 2 counters (and a side pop up on weekends) with separate queues. That said, you should still queue up, and do try their drip coffee at least once. Latte is amazing, which I personally still prefer. But they sure know how to do their drips properly."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Forget the coffee, the waffles here are amazing. They come fresh off the griddle and are heavy on the butter. Granted, the drip coffee and the latte were both very good as well. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is that the wait was a bit excessive for a coffee house. Still, I will definitely go back for more waffles!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"When I first heard the hype about Blue Bottle, I wasn't sure. One taste of the chicory laden New Orleans style iced coffee and I was in love. The waffles are mouth watering as well. Even though the place is constantly busy, the staff is friendly and enjoyable. You need to try this coffee, if only once in your life."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"How I love thee, let me count the ways.... such great consistent coffee that is absolutely worth the wait. I used to go to the location below my old office in 30 Rock and it's great to finally have it closer to the source (the flagship is in Oakland). You can't go wrong with their drip or lattes here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Excellent local coffee. I always go there and get fresh roasted coffee beans. I always order a cup of latte whenever I pass the place. They make very good quality of latte art. Not only are they delicious but they're also great looking. The beans are a little pricy but definitely worth it!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, friendly service, expect a wait. The ferry building is a fun place to nosh and window shop. It's a well known tourist spot which means it's usually crowded. Blue bottle coffee is always excellent."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops in San Francisco, although I wish they have a place to sit inside too."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle just isn’t that good. It’s got a lotta hype, and not a lotta quality to back it up.  They’re corporate now! They’ve got a billion products in grocery stores across the US. This whole niche coffee shop vibe doesn’t work anymore, y’all might as well be a Starbucks.  Start making good coffee and maybe we can talk, but for now your beans are all under roasted and your baristas burn everything."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Jake, thanks for leaving a review! We appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback, and we'd love to hear more about your visit. Please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Ordered a cappuccino and waited about 15mins in line on a Saturday morning which I found to be reasonable for the cup I was about to enjoy. As we turned the corner to keep walking through the building I saw an enormous line and I had to ask what everyone was waiting for. It turned out to be for another window for Blue Bottle! I felt bad for those that had already been waiting in line for a while when the line I left had less than 10 people. There should be a better way for patrons to order their drinks. Overall the coffee was not worth all the hype. It was a good cup, but not worthy of standing in line for more than 10-15mins. They also sell bags of beans or books if that's your thing."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Being new to San Francisco and being a coffee drinker, everyone told me that I had to try Blue Bottle.  So a few weeks ago I walked right into the Ferry Building and looked for the longest line.  Just a half hour later,  I managed to get a cup of Blue Bottle Coffee.  It's a good coffee, don't get me wrong, but if you go to a more public Blue Bottle, such as at the Ferry Building or at SFMOMA be ready to wait for a least a half hour.  Blue Bottle is a double edged sword. The coffee is really good and it is very popular but the reason it is very popular is because each cup of coffee is individually brewed. Which makes for a very fresh cup of coffee but perfection takes time.  I'm glad I finally waited and got a cup but I would never wait in that line again.  If I came across a Blue Bottle where the line wasn't insane I would have myself another cup, but I have been all over the city and the lines at Blue Bottle are always out the door."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee beans, friendly service, decent but not overlong wait time.  However, take note: do not expect a proper shot of espresso on Labor Day weekend.  I like espresso.  Not lattes, cappuccinos, not anything flavored, diluted, or sweetened.  Just a straight shot.  I own a relatively modest setup at home, a grinder plus a compact espresso machine with a PID.  I'm nowhere near an expert, but I know what a bad shot tastes like because I have made many, many of them on the journey to pulling a decent one.  So I ordered a decaf espresso.  That's right, you heard me.  Decaf.  It's super difficult to find good decaf, but I know Blue Bottle's bean quality is alright because I've shopped around, tasted, and finally settled on subscribing to a weekly 1 lb delivery.  (Which is awesome, by the way.)  I pull my own shots at home and am pretty satisfied.  So when I was served a very sour shot at this location, I was disappointed.  The color didn't look too bad, but I admit I didn't examine it very closely as we had an appointment, and quite simply, I expected better.  Maybe the didn't dose properly, or maybe the temperature was too low.  Can't say.  To be fair, I didn't complain and ask them to try again.  They might've done a better job the second time around.  As I said earlier, however, the servers were very friendly.  While we waited for our (delicious) caramelized waffle, they mistakenly made a decaf latte for the next person in line.  They offered it to me, and I took two or three sips to wash out the nasty taste of the espresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Delicious cold brew! They had three different kinds on tap - so choose whichever. Its a deep, dark, nutty flavor - very earthy and robust. Love their coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"There's so many craft coffee places in this city. For a while, when I'd have the hankering for a cup, I would try a new place every time. I stopped going to other coffee joints after I experienced Blue Bottle. I'm so sold on this coffee. If you could be in love with a coffee, I'd wanna share my pillow with it. I wouldn't even mind if it never clipped it's toenails. It's better than an infinite dose of oxytocin. So friggin' good! Best Cappo I've ever had."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great spot to go after eating lunch at the ferry building. The lines can be kinda long but the coffee is always good and strong. I like getting their americano and latte. Skip the mocha and the baked goods, they're only okay."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Certainly the people who were serving were very nice. Unfortunately let down by the coffee. I ordered a 6oz Gibraltar (essentially a double shot flat white with less milk). It somehow still tasted like warm milk, no coffee flavor, no grunt."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Waited 15 minutes for a $7 coffee after using the self order kiosk with no line.  Finally asked the cashier about it and he apologized and said he’d take the machine offline.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh no! We'd love to hear more about your visit, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Though potentially swamped, quite attentive and rapid espresso production. I ordered a mocha this morning. It took less than five minutes from order to pick-up. I haven’t seen the side window open early in the morning lately. I only stop by every month or two in the morning. Hack for locals: Affogato on your way past in the afternoon because who gets coffee after 3:00 PM? Not tourists. Lines aren’t super nuts later in the day. Trivia: KWD Expression espresso machine on the secret approach."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Maybe I’m not a coffee connoisseur but I really don’t think it tastes much different from Starbucks.  The staff was friendly and received the coffe fast but it was just OK. I had the iced coffee which was good but had to add some simple syrup for it to taste better.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I had just ordered my cappuccino from the main counter, when I saw a little window open on the side! Could it be I had stood in line for no reason!?  I've been following Blue Bottle LA on Instagram, so had to try this when I spotted it in the ferry building. Excellent coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The baristas here are friendly, fantastic, and fast! Go with the drip coffees for authenticity. The breakfast selections (yogurt, pastries) are also delicious, but do not include cooked selections like the Mint Plaza location."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"If you see a really long line in the Ferry building, you know its for Blue Bottle Coffee. This place has risen to become one of the best coffee places and the fans claim their coffee is better than all of Starbucks & Peets out there.  There is a secret menu here so make sure you check that out instead of just ordering something off the menu. Most of the coffees are good but too bitter for me (an avid latte lover). If you think you will just grab a cup here and sit for hours using the free wifi then you will be disappointed as there is no seating at this location and no wifi (free or paid) offered."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"10 minutes wait for order and 15 for pick up and then they didn’t take the order right. We tell the lady and she tells us to wait. 10 minutes later she had forgotten the whole thing so yes, we leave with one coffee for two people after 35 minutes wait and not even a sorry from them.  We weren’t the only guys dealing with their poor service. While we waited, four other orders were wrong and one guy waited longer than us to get an expresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Ohno! We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Get your upscale, quality latte here. A little pricy, but delicious.  And best of all, try the Liege Waffle which is not available is all locations, and even here only part of the day. It's reminiscent of the waffles you can get on the streets in Belgium. Amazing, and not to be confused with the Americanized ""belgian waffle""."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The lines are always atrocious at this Ferry Building location of San Francisco favorite Blue Bottle Coffee. Their hot chocolate is quite good, but I was a bit disappointed by the waffle. They do have a decent selection of merchandise that you can stare at and/or purchase while you wait though, including branded items as well as crazy coffee making concoctions."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Been to this place twice this week. The machine for Credit cards are broken for 2 days straight. Only take swipe.  They are backed up and there is no one here.  I ordered a cold brew and i am waiting over 5 minutes for it. Literally no one is here!  Management needs to really step up  1 star
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving a review! We'd love to hear more about your visit, please reach out at support@bluebottlecoffee.com so we can assist. Thanks again!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Had the New Orleans coffee. Bean was either very strong or slightly burned. It wasn’t my favorite roast I’ve had but better than average. Personally I think Philz is comparable if not better and costs the same.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Located in the Ferry Building, Blue Bottle Coffee is always bumping. Always. There are always people lining up here: morning, afternoon, weekdays, weekends. Although the coffee is great, I'm always there in the morning to get the WAFFLES.  The delicious Belgian waffles with sugar in them (I am slowly salivating as I type this up).  I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the Ferry Building."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Visited this with a few friends, unfortunately the drip coffee could not be iced and we had to switch to cold brew. Still good coffee nonetheless! Try their Ethiopia before they change the blend mix!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Liege waffle + NOLA ice coffee are my go-to's here, or a mocha if it's chillier out. When I'm not in the mood for Starbucks and want to splurge on coffee, this Blue Bottle offers the quality and ambiance I'm looking for. This is a bustling location, so the wait can be long."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Was walking by when an elderly woman in a wheelchair asked me for help as the staff at Blue Bottle wouldn't serve her. She had a gift certificate but they wouldn't take her order. When I placed the order on her behalf, the staff member who served me had a really pretentious attitude and basically rolled his eyes at us. I'm sure the coffee is okay but how rude can you get? Would never ever visit again."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi Kathryn, we are very sorry to hear about this unpleasant experience at our Ferry Building cafe. We would love to continue the conversation at support@bluebottlecoffee.com if you're interested!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"If you haven't already visited the Blue Bottle stand in the ferry building, go. Seriously, just drop whatever you're doing and go there this very second. Blue Bottle is hands down my favorite Bay Area coffee and their locale in the Ferry Building stands right up there in quality with their Oakland location. Coffee is great, and the Waffles they serve will literally knock your socks off. I took my GRE exam at a testing center a block away, and I spent the half hour preceding the test drinking Blue Bottle coffee and eating their waffles to calm my nerves. Best start to a test ever."
Blue Bottle Coffee,One of my favorite coffee shops in the Bay Area. I personally enjoy their single origin iced coffee. This one is more of like a booth with no seatings. I enjoy the experience more at their Mint Plaza location.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I received some coffee last year, but end up very disappointed of the beans. I emailed the Blue Bottle and send me a bag of new beans a few weeks later. Service is slow and coffee is good. Just don't be in a hurry."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Over-priced coffee in the ferry building?  Gee, that's unusual.  Man, if you're gonna charge those prices, at least have some decent coffee, seriously.  I actually equate this to ferry coffee I endure sometimes, but $4 cheaper.  Do yourself a favor and walk a couple of shops further to Peet's Coffee.  Always taste."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Forget the name but I had the new iced coffee- it was VERY good... beautiful texture and flavor. The guy who served me, Rason, wAs extremely professional/friendly to myself and the people around me; he consicely explained differences between drinks and was very knowledgeable and caring about the product/customer. I actually wasn’t even going to get anything until I heard him talking about the coffee...my sister and I have both worked in the food industry (her even more so) and we both took note on what a great impression Rason left on us as customers and just people in general. I didn’t catch the other guys name but he was also very professional and thoughtful. Great experience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I didn't want to love Blue Bottle. But in a blind coffee taste, they won hands down. It is exquisite coffee, no bitterness, smooth, delightful, dark perfection. Go. I like embarcadero best -- it is the most efficient. Mint plaza line is insane."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee and offer tons of varieties to take home. It can be overwhelming if you don't know much about coffee, but the staff will help you out. Be prepared to wait because they get busy and some of the coffee takes longer to make."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Walking up to the window I had just planned on ordering my usual quad macchiato as a quick start on the day.  A waffle on a display caught my attention and I said - what the heck I'll try one.  I've been obsessing about this ever since - it's all-in-one and easy to eat.  No need for butter or syrup since it's all built in.  I'll have to head back to SFO soon; I made them at home this morning based on what was alleged to be the Blue Bottle recipe but it's not the same.  Save some calories for this one; and the coffee is great too.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Another location of Blue Bottle. Usually, there is a huge line at this place too but they do have two counters. A lot of people from out of town, just walk straight to the main entrance and wait in line but there is a side window as well where the line is usually shorter. Try their New Orleans style iced coffee or having a hot coffee with their waffle in the morning. Delicious!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I was led to this place by a friend who's showing me around SF. Thanks to him and Blue Bottle, a wonderful cup of latte (and a lovely cupcake from the nearby bakery) made my day. I know the long queue could be a killer to some, but thanks to the long wait I got the chance to have a bit of alone time 'chit chatting' with this friend. Would love to come back here when I'm in SF again."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"There isn't a lot of space to sit, but when you want a jolt of caffeine while you shop around the Ferry Building, this is the place to go. The line looks long, but it moves fast, and the coffee is sooooo good. I drink a lot of decaf and this place does a killer decaf latte."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Nice coffee, understands what a latte actually is. Coffee itself was nice and well prepared. Would have got five but disparity between quality of my coffee and friend's dropped a star. Fairly long wait in a queue."
Blue Bottle Coffee,This was the best cortado I’ve had in a very long time!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Friendly and knowledgeable staff! Coffee was amazing!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle takes their coffee seriously, really seriously. This particular location is always mayhem with the tourists overflowing the building, however knowing that the line is worth the wait makes it all okay. Especially once you get your fix of new orleans and a fennel shortbread cookie. Sip and nibble and go forth happy and caffeinated."
Blue Bottle Coffee,A very popular coffee shop inside of the Ferry Building.  I tried afogato and it was very good!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle I have heard of your fame Among the elite you're a household name Now what I'm about to say may get me persecuted And from coffee lovers I may be persecuted But your coffee is acidic and bitter So in terms of blue bottle call me a quitter  Ok I've tried to like it, but for some reason I really don't like blue bottle.  It's too acidic, and messes up my stomach.  I like philz a lot better. I even true to get their afogato (vanilla ice cream drenched in expresso) but even that I didn't like.  My two star review is purely on personal taste."
Blue Bottle Coffee,I came here early Saturday morning after just arriving in SF and running on one hour of sleep! I ordered the macchiato and was surprised. I'm used to caramel macchiatos at Starbucks but a macchiato comes in those little espresso mugs. The coffee was strong I got the caffeine I needed to get me through exploring the city. I love how they decorate your drink by adding in a little picture  on top of your drink.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Wow. 30 minutes wait for a small cup of cappuccino that you empty within 1 minute? Not including the 30 seconds for taking evidence for Instagram. People must be crazy.  II was crazy enough to line up there - what else would you do on a Sunday afternoon in the Ferry Building (nah, not really). No, I was in the mood for good coffee and 4 1/2 stars on Google Local don't lie.  After intensively studying the rest of the thirsty coffee enthusiasts behind or in front of me, and after wondering long enough why on earth they'd close the small, hidden take-out window on the side (without coming to a conclusion), it was my turn to order a $4 cappuccino.  As the ritual demands, upon receiving my nicely foamed cuppa coffee I immediately made a top shot for Instagram, and Google Local. I also made sure everyone around me notices how much I enjoy my $4 cup by making a loud ""ahhh, hmmmmm"" noise.  Blue Bottle certainly knows what they do - great quality coffee, friendly baristas. It's up to you if you want to wait there for 30 minutes plus. Hey, but the Instagram afterwards is just worth it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I don't think I've ever had a coffee anywhere else as good as Blue Bottle. Let me get one thing clear after saying that. People, in general, loooove to rave about some popular option, and then that options gets raved about more and more, until what really set it aside in the first place is shadowed by this reputation. Pliny the Elder, the beer from Russian River, for instance. People just LOOOVE to tell you how awesome it is. Is it really awesome, though, or are you just repeating some opinion you heard, like you were back in college reading Pitchfork online and spouting off about Godspeed You! Black Emperor in the dining hall like you knew what you were talking about. Let's be fair, it's probably the latter. That said, this coffee ""lives up to the hype"". Love it. Would drink every single day and hate every other cup of coffee I had elsewhere."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee. A little citrusy. The customer service is good, line move decently quick, and with just a limited selection to order from, it makes it that much easier. Just like the location in Oakland, its homeplace, it is quaint, with trendy wood trimming.  Grab your coffee and go outside and look at the Embarcadero and enjoy the foggy sunny area."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"My favorite coffee in the city.  Better than Ritual, Peet's, and Philz.  I can't really describe it much more than that.  I'm a huge coffee nut and so I'm quite particular about my coffee.  My wife buys the cheap stuff.  I buy the gourmet stuff because I like to taste it.  But that's not what's important here.  What's imporant is the flavor of their cappuccino, because it's second to none.  Espresso shots taste like used motor oil (good thing) and the drip coffee is manually dripped old-school style (or coffee machine-less style).  The only reason I gave service a ""Very Good"" is because the line was really long due to their popularity.  Highly recommend it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Food: 4 Decor: 3 Service: 4  Waited 20 min in line Saturday morning around 10am.  Had a couple sips of the decaf soy mocha, which wasn't bad, and a Belgian waffle, which was pretty good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Excellent coffee, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and glad that I visited SF so I could stock up on their freshly roasted beans. My favorite: Giant Steps. Also got Three Africans blend to try."
Blue Bottle Coffee,♿️ = plentiful outdoor seating  The coffee here was well made well seasoned and fast
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This place is great . Great staff, service , and product . Glad it’s in the neighborhood. Highly recommend."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Oh how I was torn between an espresso drink from here vs. a scoop of ice cream from Humphrey Slocombe. After much deliberation, I decided to meet in the middle and go with the affogato, thinking it would be a mini scoop of sub-par ice cream with the espresso.  To my pleasant, surprise, however, it turned out to be a heaping ""single"" scoop of Humphrey's vanilla! Pour that delicious blue bottle espresso on top and you have a delightful concoction. The creaminess of the ice cream combined with the nuttiness of the espresso delighted my taste buds. The espresso began to mix with the ice cream, and even started created a creamy slushy combination which I loved.  To top it all off, the price of the affogato was cheaper than if you were to get a smaller single scoop from Humphrey! A win win, in my book."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Very good coffee and snacks
Blue Bottle Coffee,Really good coffee. Sit down out door and enjoy the bay-view in combination with sandwiches from acmebread-shop.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Bit pricey but happy there's a native coffee shop in the Ferry Building - it's fitting!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Other coffee beans have an oily almost waxy beans. Blue Bottle Coffe is dry roasted in Oakland packaged less than 2 weeks of roasting. Throw away your Kurig and any coffee machines and try the freshest drip coffee in the world!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Known throughout SF for good coffee. PROTIP: Avoid the lines and exit the ferry building and go around the smaller storefront they have right outside the door. Yes - there's a second one! Almost never a line there.
Blue Bottle Coffee,First coffee that I had in SF and it was great!
Blue Bottle Coffee,The coffee is average. The queue is massive and you have to wait for good 15 mins to pick your coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Don't be deterred by the queue! The coffee is worth the wait. This is a great place to take visitors for a San Francisco experience. The views from the Ferry Building are spectacular.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, friendly staff and historic ferry building"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"A beautifully kitted out little shop selling coffee and merch (coffee sack tote bags, beans, elaborate airpress machines) rather than the kiosk I was expecting. Lovely creamy latte, if *very* strong, for $3.75. Not immediately clear from the setup or service, though, why this is such a cult."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best drip coffee in SF!
Blue Bottle Coffee,The best coffee in SanFrancisco!  Their chocolate in the mocha is a delicious local creation and the very subtle sweet espresso in the latte does not punch you in the face like starbucks.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Amazing, freshly-brewed coffee and even better tasting liege waffles! If you stop by the Ferry Building, check them out!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great taste, the black cardamom latte is amazing 😍"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Coffee great and the waffles are yummy. Sometimes I find the lattes a little cooler than I would like, but the flavor is always good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Probably my favorite coffee spot in the city. Lattes with oat milk are an absolute game changer. Coffee is always fresh and won't let you down.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Phenomenal coffee. Everything is good here - drip, latte etc but I'm particularly fond of their New Orleans style ice coffee. Be ready for a long line, especially on market days."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Apparently I came across as frazzled when I asked for whatever coffee would be ready the fastest...and the cashier said it would be on the house. What a sweetie! That kindness helped me relax just a bit. 😘 And the coffee was fantastic! …
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Wow. Amazing drip coffee. I took one star away because they forgot about my order even though I saw my coffee sitting on the back counter,  none of the employees remembered to give it to me.  Didn't forget to take my money though.  :p"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Long line and you pay a bit more. But the taste is good. You also make the choice of going with something which is being hyped. Each cup is brewed individually which makes it great tasting.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Lines are always long and I'm not too big a fan of the coffee. Definitely go once just to say you've been. No seating- order, wait, get a move on."
Blue Bottle Coffee,I’m a needy guy - my go-to drink is a decaf oat milk cappuccino. These guys nailed it to perfection. The best I had in all of San Fran during my recent trip.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I'm not a coffee connoisseur, and if you're not either, then you probably won't find it ""worth it"" to stand in the long-ass line. I usually only go to Blue Bottle when I have friends in town, so if none of you really aren't all that into coffee, I'd go elsewhere and skip the wait."
Blue Bottle Coffee,San Francisco best coffer shop. Latte is art^^
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee and service. I love their pastries and small cakes. Get ready for a long queue but worth the wait! There are other locations in the city as well!
Blue Bottle Coffee,My friends swear by their coffee and I love the vibe here!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Love their goods and coffee as well
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Every time I'm at the Ferry Building, this is my go to place for coffee ;) Do expect long lines around lunch time but hey! it's part of the fun ;) Enjoy the coffee and people watching there! ;)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best cafe latte I’ve ever had in life!
Blue Bottle Coffee,This is hype and a half. Hipster crap ass coffee. I'm sure it was organically pulled out of something's butt and prepared by someone who never shaves but god I've never had a worse cup of coffee. Overpriced too. Why the hell was there a line for this crap?
Blue Bottle Coffee,Crazy long queue but worth the wait. The people here understand what good coffee is and they didnt disappoint. The coffee was amazing - the best Ive had.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"They have the best expresso here. Smooth and light. The iced coffee is good too, almost like vietnamese coffee. Definitely beats the kick in the nuts you get with a Pete's iced coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Mocha and blueberry lemon scone, the perfect combo to eat outside on the ocean patios and check out the scenery. Good service!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Coffee here was good. It's a San Francisco favourite, and admittedly, while I'm not an uber coffee junkie, I found their roast to be quite delightful. I even bought a bad of beans..."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Love the coffee. Consistent and good. This location has waffles too which are really good
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Inside pier 1, some of the best coffee you can get. Excellent pour over and espresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Amazing coffee - really enjoyed the cappuccino and the iced coffee is definitely worth trying! Might have to queue up a bit, but it doesn't take particularly long."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Always good coffee. Love their new self order system!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee joint today as it was 5 years ago when I first tried it out. It is a very SF experience though it is more mainstream, and still good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"If you manage to go when there isn't really a line, it's really worth it. Otherwise, just go to another one of Blue Bottle's locations and enjoy the amazing coffee in peace."
Blue Bottle Coffee,So crowded but so good. Espresso drinks and coffee. If there's ever a small-ish line I go. I can't help it. And the treats are so good. I'm a sucker for the absinthe cigar.
Blue Bottle Coffee,One of my favourite places for coffee!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great espresso latte with oak milk..
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great location for some excellent coffee when you've just stepped off a ferry in the San Francisco fog. There'll likely be a wait, but for good reason."
Blue Bottle Coffee,I don't know what the hype is all about with blue bottle. There's always a long line here. But I find their coffee to be bitter and burnt tasting. The coffee isn't cheap either. But it is no better than McDonald's $1 coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best coffee ever
Blue Bottle Coffee,Oh my! Best Coffee! Expertly made by very kind staff! Need a 6th Star to rate this place!  #sixthstar #sixstar #6star #6thstar
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The pace at the permanent location inside the Ferry Building is fortunately a little faster than glacial pace at other locations, but whatever you do avoid the Blue Bottle cart that they setup outside on Farmers' market days - you'll die of old age before you get a cup of coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Got a cortado to be safe, still milky and not tasting coffee. Not expecting lack of consistency when paying higher than else where."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, 3rd wave local roaster."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I came looking to be impressed, but found a normal coffee shop with above average prices. I'm sticking to the Blue Bottle I can buy in the carton at the grocery store."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Go in here for a cup of decaff coffee.  $5.00..!!  Tell the guy I want cream and splenda.. He says yes sir. I pay that.  Wait 10 mins for them to make it.  And then, SURPRISE!!!  NO SPLENDA NO REFUND."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The line was always long, you may need to wait about 15 minutes to get your coffee"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The location of the Blue bottle is great. It’s close to the water and a fun visit. The coffee is great too.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Best coffee in SF.  I always grab some to bring home.  May have to wait some during high traffic times and because coffee is pour over, but it's so good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Super nice guys, they saw me with a competitor coffee in my hand, the offered me to taste their cappuccino.. one word: amazing! Must try!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Refused to make an original Italian Cappuccino (1 shot espresso with steamed milk). More interested in keeping prices high with gratuitously huge drinks than serving real espresso drinks.
Blue Bottle Coffee,The best coffee I️ have ever drank in the US
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good coffee with lovely staffs
Blue Bottle Coffee,Be prepared for a line at the location's main hall checkout. Pro tip: Peek the side hallway window checkout or outdoor kiosk to expedite getting your Blue Bottle fix.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best coffee I've had in a while! Truly fantastic! The ginger molasses cookie was tasty!
Blue Bottle Coffee,My favorite blue bottle location because they have the liege waffles here which is a must try!! And obviously the coffee is amazing too!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Literally just fine
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hi there, thanks for leaving this review! We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,I simply love blue bottle coffee.  it's the best coffee on the planet. and the ferry building is just awesome.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Quick and prompt services. They were also very welcoming when you walk into the store. The vibe in there was really great and it made my day better.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best hot chocolate I have ever had!
Blue Bottle Coffee,The New Orleans iced latte is the best I’ve ever had. Great coffee!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"This spot is always bustling in the Ferry building. Top-notch coffee, but very limited seating and long lines. Order from the window instead."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really good coffee. This location is a bit short on the typical Blue Bottle eats, so check out the Mint or Sansome locations for that."
Blue Bottle Coffee,may have finally jumped the shark - matching the citywide cappuccino price raise is fine I guess - adding sales tax on top was less cool
Blue Bottle Coffee,"the waffle is amazing with coffee for breakfast. bold, strong coffee"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Super friendly staff, geeked out about their craft"
Blue Bottle Coffee,i have never had a memorable espresso based coffee where I taste a little sweetness in the milk !!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Bluebottle must be the only place to train their barristas properly. Hands-down the best cappuccino in SF.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Slow service but worth the wait. Mind you, coffee here is bit more acidic. Go for the almond milk cappuccino."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Fantastic coffee, friendly and knowledgable staff.  Be prepared for a wait though, this place can get busy!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Friendly staff at this counter-only shop.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee but how come places in SF don’t advertise flat whites?!? Get with the times!
Blue Bottle Coffee,The waffle is one of my new favs! Everything here is great! The affogato is a must try!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Best coffee in the world. Order the new orleans iced coffee. If you're in the mood for a nibble, try the olive oil shortbread."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Really good coffee! Sad you can't have bigger cups. And a little bit pricey!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"my favorite coffee supplier. I love getting the prepackage new orleans coffee, reminds me of drinking out of milk cartons."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good place to get a coffee before catching a ferry. I love their delicious coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,An enjoyable coffee anytime in the area. Got a latte and enjoyed every single bit of it. A good coffee with a meal or after a meal.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee, either expresso or drip. You will wait but it is very good coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Fun people, great coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Do the world a favor and avoid Blue Bottle as Nestle has acquired a majority stake in this company. Why support Nestle?
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Liked the Colombian roast coffee, I drink my coffee black but this one has a hint of sweetness that is just perfect"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"When passing by if I see there's no line, I'll stop by to grab one of their latte's which is perfect in all respects yet alas thanks to the queues I can't do that much which is great for my wallet!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great coffee stop in the ferry building, tasty drinks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great oat cappuccino and flat white. Nice service.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Pretty good coffee - getting a bit commercialized compared to Four Barrel or other local beaneries thought
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great coffee but snobby and rude staff. There are nicer places to get quality coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best latte I have tasted!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,This coffee rocks. You've got to try it. Anything you order will be great!!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Try the New Orleans iced coffee. Lines can be long and crowded waiting area. Coffee is great.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good coffee but not worth the long lines with Peets right around the corner!
Blue Bottle Coffee,They have really good expresso/lattes. The coffee tasted fruity.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Awesome coffee, friendly staff and the wait times aren't too bad at all. Thank you ☕️"
Blue Bottle Coffee,So good. Expensive. A little slow.
Blue Bottle Coffee,you can get your coffee inside the ferry building or outside and enjoy sun
Blue Bottle Coffee,Basic coffee joint. I usually just get the drip and I like how they make it to order using a filter. Line can get long though.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee, high expectations, but like my home coffee shop better, and better is available in San Francisco"
Blue Bottle Coffee,It was worth standing in line for a half hour. Absolutely great coffee. #coffee
Blue Bottle Coffee,Consistently the best latte I have ever had time and time again. Nuff said!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Nice coffee with the beautiful view.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Really good latte, absolutely love the coffee here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Good coffee. The Ferry Building is very cool and the views are great.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Nice coffee! Nice service!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Delicious single source coffee.  Two locations here, less wait outside."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The line is always long and sometimes it moves so, so slowly. But the coffee is always worth it!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I guess it was good for a quick pick me up before heading on the ferry but, not the best."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Very good coffee. On the expensive side and often a long line
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The best coffee I had in San Francisco, but as others said, loooooong wait!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Delicious latte. The same taste you can find in Italy.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Insanely slow service and super expensive prices which doesn’t stand to quality
Blue Bottle Coffee,"We'd love to hear more about your coffee, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Very good coffee, friendly service but too slow"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Loved the coffee the staff is very friendly and attentive, also the place is very clean"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Drip coffee takes longer than a cappuccino, but worth the wait!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Great place to sit or buy coffee to go, authentic espresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Best coffee I’ve had in San Fran, by far."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great tasting coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"If you want a cup of Joe and you want it fast, this is not your place- but if you have some time and scrill- get your drink on."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The best cappuccinos, espresso and affogato. Excellent service:"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"There are two things I always make sure to do when I visit San Francisco, see my father and drink Blue Bottle Coffee espresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Visiting from Sydney, this is what I've been looking for. Excellent coffee even by Sydney's standards."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Excellent coffe with an even greater staff!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Amazing coffee, staff are super friendly."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Everything here is a comfort, the drip keeps me warm and happy in a cold place"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Had a delicious affogato
Blue Bottle Coffee,Perfect combination!
Blue Bottle Coffee,One of the best spots in the area. Looking forward to coming back with my relatives.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Cool
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee, long lines. I prefer my coffee warmer though!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Baristas in this spot need to pick up there game. Bad espresso for bluebottle standards.
Blue Bottle Coffee,The most famous coffee in San Francisco. You should try.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Affogato! Rich, bittersweet, a better balance than having the Humphrey Slocombe alone!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Had their drip coffee and it was great!
Blue Bottle Coffee,Quintessential coffee spot. Long lines but great coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Best Affogato ever! The staff was extremely friendly as well!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Good coffee and friendly staff, worth a little wait"
Blue Bottle Coffee,Excellent latte and very good iced coffee!

Blue Bottle Coffee,"Place that sells coffee to go. It is very rich, there are different ones and it costs between 6 and 7 dollars with the tax. You can buy bags of coffee beans to grind. Delicious! I recommend!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,The branch of the famous Blue Bottle Coffee in the Ferry Building only has take-out and no seating area! It is always crowded no matter weekdays or holidays! 👍
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Located on the 1st floor of the Ferry Building I went around 4:00 on Monday, but there weren't many people, so I bought it right away. I went to buy ground coffee beans as a gift, but they only sell coffee beans as they are. Cold brew is sold. I tried the latte because it was good, but it was good because it didn't feel greasy. There are no chairs in the shop itself, so it's good to go behind the ferry building and drink while watching the sea from the bench."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The headquarters of Blue Bottle is here. He recommended a latte, so I ordered it despite liking Americano. Oh ~~ It's a good latte that feels like the first taste of milk foam spreads gently in your mouth. The foam follows until you finish drinking the latte. There are people who go to work downtown by ferry, so the line is long even in the early morning. Instead, on Sunday morning, as you can see in my photos, it's quiet.  You can also pick up the blue bottle badge for free."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle on Mint Street Visited during the day on a weekday and was a bit crowded! But it wasn't long enough to wait in line!  I drank espresso, but I failed because I chose something with strong acidity.. And I bought a few things such as beans and drippers, All were delicious!  11 dollars for 250 grams of beans! You can also buy a dripper as a souvenir for $25. It's called self-made!  There were high bar stools, wooden chairs, and outdoor seats in the store!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"They have many products to offer from coffee with several interesting recipes, chocolate, tea and waffle to accompany. Some brand products such as cups, coffee makers and whole or soluble coffee to go. The line is long and the chocolate normal. slightly expensive."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle Coffee located inside the Ferry Building. The store itself is not big, but I recommend taking it out and sitting on a bench outside and watching the sea!!  The line to order coffee is shorter than expected.  But there is no Kyoto-style coffee here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The Capucino is to die for. It's delicious. I recommand it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I went to the 3rd Army based on Market ST, and it would be nice to come to visit when you come to see the night view of Bay Bridge or the pier.  There is a ferry terminal right in front."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"I went because the latte was famous, but it didn't taste very special. Just when I brewed coffee, I felt honesty when I saw that the coffee powder was weighed and the coffee was made according to the amount."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Blue Bottle Headquarters. Latte is smooth and delicious It's good to have coffee on the terrace outside the ferry building Except for the cold...
Blue Bottle Coffee,I ordered a latte to drink and thought it tasted ordinary
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Hey there, thanks for this review! We'd love to hear more, can you email us at support@bluebottlecoffee.com? Thanks!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The coffee is very good, but from my point of view it is a bit expensive."
Blue Bottle Coffee,the staff was friendly Coffee tasted fresh Cappuccino is served in a small and cute cup rather than the original amount. I can't sleep because there's a lot of caffeine in it. I need to sleep...
Blue Bottle Coffee,This is the head office of Blue Bottle. There are two order slots. The cold brew I drank this time was fruity and very delicious!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue Bottle headquarters in Ferry Building, Latte and Lemonade! It wasn't even life latte The lemon curd wasn't enough, so I asked for more. I was scared because I had high expectations."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Gibraltar secret menu recommendation (a double shot of espresso mixed with latte/but I ordered it iced and the clerk changed it to a mocaccino iced latte because they said it was the same but didn't know): It tasted like a mixture of coffee with light grain flour! delicious!!  New Orleans + Oat Milk (not just milk): I ate it because an acquaintance recommended it. I recommend Gibraltar♥️ I was happy that the staff was so kind  Did you expect too much? The coffee I drank in South America tasted better..🥺 So 4 stars!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"You can stop by the Ferry Building before boarding the Sausalito Han Ferry. As one of the top 3 coffee chains you must visit in San Francisco, it strongly defines the brand color through the arrangement of two colors, white and blue. As it is called the Apple of coffee, this place has an unforgettable taste and color. Since it is inside the ferry building, there can be a lot of people, so there can be quite a waiting time, so check the ferry time carefully. It is good to take a coffee and take a sip after coming out of the Ferry Building and sitting on a bench near the dock. The menu recommends cafe latte, and there is no parking lot in the building, so use a nearby public parking lot."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Blue bottle near the ferry port. Hand drip uses beans with a strong acidity overall. Latte is recommended for those who are not good at it. The scenery is great, so go outside and enjoy a cup of coffee while gazing at the sea."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The famous coffee beans introduced in travel books have a mild taste.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"We lined up for a short while, but we were soon served delicious coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The staff is friendly, and the New Orleans coffee is delicious."

Blue Bottle Coffee,Little-known blue bottle. You can buy without lining up too much. The drip coffee was rich and had a berry scent and a good acidity.
Blue Bottle Coffee,Latte is really good👍👍👍
Blue Bottle Coffee,I can just drink latte the most comfortably.
Blue Bottle Coffee,"There are two stores in the Ferry Building, so use the one that is not crowded. There is also canned coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"Purchased beans and eco bags. The eco bag has the store here printed on it, so I think it's a good souvenir."
Blue Bottle Coffee,The coffee tastes fantastic here!
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The line is a bit long. Like other stores here, there are no seats and take-out only."
Blue Bottle Coffee,"It doesn't seem to have a special taste, but it was still good. There are a lot of people."
Blue Bottle Coffee,Great! Delicious~
Blue Bottle Coffee,"The latte is delicious, but it's zombie-cheap haha"
Blue Bottle Coffee,"You may have to wait in line, but it's well worth a cup of coffee."
