Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Can't beat the location! Loved bringing my dog to Dolores Park and can definitely see us eating at this cafe again. Got the Egg sandwich (it was just as pretty as the pictures! ) and the Pastrami on Rye. Both were good. Also got a chai latte because it was freezing outside, but next time would definitely opt for their smoothies and juices since they sound fun and delicious. Overall, a great find and nice spot to hang out with friends and your dog."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,I found this super cute cafe near the park. I ordered a drip coffee. I waited like 10 minutes and I was so confused why it was taking so long. Apparently they completely forgot about my coffee. If I didn't say something I would have waited all day. Lol!
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Went to this coffee shop for the very first time. Absolutely amazing coffee and great customer service. Most definitely will return. Employee who assisted us was Eli or Elijah.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,The lazy and indifferent employee forgot half of our order and then had an attitude with us when we reminded him. Also the coffee we ordered was one of the worst coffees I ever had. Tasted like the dirty water after cleaning a coffee machine. Avoid this place. They have a good location by the park but that is all they got going for them.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Cute and homey coffeeshop with WiFi and outdoor seating right on the park. Great place to spend an afternoon with a friend, a book or a laptop. I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"SF DISCLAIMER: it's expensive go figure  I will come back for the regular grilled cheese sandwich because it's probably alright!  At the recommendation, I had the *special* grilled cheese with a tomato bisque. It was good, but I suppose I prefer my grilled cheese to be just that... bread with cheese. No veggies or meat mucking things up!  Service nice; vibes cool."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Breakfast burrito while small was delish. As a whole this spot is expensive without a lot to show for it. Been here forever for good reason but now IMHO it skews more towards having a menu rich with items lending to good margins for the operator/ owner. Convenient across the st from the park/ Bi rite
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"My review is strictly about the coffee. IF YOU ARE THE TYPE THAT LIKES THE NEW LIGHT ROAST THEN THIS IS YOUR PLACE. I am not so convinced🤔 I prefer dark roast espresso similar to the Nespresso or what you would get in Italy, France or Switzerland, for example. Light roast coffee has a more acidic or fruity note and taste which just doesn't agree with me. If you are mixing your expresso into your frappuccino then it probably won't make much of a difference for you. Double espresso with a splash of soy, $4.20 But if you like to just sip a single or double expresso exactly the way it is then you have to consider all of this. Dark vs. Light...."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Mocha with soy - OK taste, good price. Wifi - 👍 Bright space with lots of seating inside and out - 👍 Variety of food on menu - 👍 Chill music - 👍 Plug to charge devices🔌- only one behind the fridge.  Good place to pull out the laptop to get some work done, catchup with a friend,  or chill with a book and people watch.  Visited on July 4 at 10.15 am."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Amazingly delicious and fresh sandwiches and a wonderful view of the park and street corner. I got a special chicken sandwich, the bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside to compliment the sauteed mushrooms, chicken, juicy tomato and more. Seriously healthy and fresh food."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Was really disappointed with my experience considering the reviews here. My food was great but my Golden Latte was lazily made and tasted of turmeric and milk. The staff were also very unhappy. It was a very busy day but it seems this place cracks under pressure. 4/5.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Beautiful and across the park from café. Enjoy, relax, and people watch."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Nice place by Dolores park. Had a vegan breakfast burrito and oat cappuccino. No complaints. I vaguely recall being disappointed as one of menu items I wanted was not available though.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great place for breakfast. Friendly staff, quick service and good variety. Everything we had was delicious: Homemade granola, French Toast, Dolores Egg Sandwich and Lox Scramble. Highly recommended!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Good coffee and good location! This cafe is right next to Dolores Park. However, they don’t have outlet to charge your laptop so I would not recommend if you want to work/study there.  EDIT: I later asked them about the outlet locations and was told that there is only one outlet, which is not in the main sitting area."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Great Thai tea and yummy grilled  cheese. Very quick service we got our order in like 5 minutes. It has a lovely view to Dolores park.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Has so much potential. Everything looks like it should be great, but turns out to be… just ok.  Parkside location is unbeatable and menu selection is expansive. It would be 5/5 if they just improved the food quality a bit.  I live 1 block away and never go because I know foods going to meh."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Amazingly tasty and fresh sandwiches and a stunning view of the street corner and park. I got a special chicken sandwich, the bread on the outside was perfectly crunchy and on the inside soft to complement the saute mushrooms, ham, juicy tomato and more. Very new, balanced food."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Good food. Good vibe. Can’t beat the location!
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Cool place for meeting, with cool things going on around, lots of people playing sports and enjoying the day in the park, but my friend had a break into his car, so be careful with that. Didn't try the food, next time."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Cute café with beautiful views onto Dolores Park and the façade of the high school. The coffee was good, the croissant was delicious, and it looks like the donuts are to die for—though I resisted."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"WAY overpriced--what you see (pastrami sandwich, comes with chips) is over $15😂🙄 Tasted good, but I can get a bigger, better tasting, and $5 cheaper of the same type of sandwich at a few other places in the city.  Huge disappointment. …"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Been there twice for breakfast, great and healthy food, nice view on Dolores Park and friendly service."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"It's a scam. San Francisco is #%^*ing expensive, but this place is a a scam - smoothies mostly water an ice, bowls you'd expect in a high school cafeteria.  There's a reason it's at the park and still half empty - be warned."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Perfect location and spot in Dolores park to grab your quick sandwich. Have gluten free bread! Friendly staff.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great option right next to Dolores Park (hence the name) and with expanded outside options, it’s even better! I was pleasantly surprised to find it easy to get a table on a perfect Saturday afternoon.  Weather is great, food all looks delicious and there are plenty of alcohol and beer options."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"This cafe survives solely by being the only place to grab a drink or snack on the same block as Dolores Park. The coffee is bitter and often burnt, the pastries and donuts are alright but even for SF standards, ridiculously priced for the quality, and the lattes are poorly made as well. I’ve tried it numerous times in good faith trying to give it another shot but it just isn’t good."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Fresh albacore tuna sandwich was amazing everything fresh and you could taste the wonderful tomatoes and crunchy pickles. The staff is friendly wonderful and very helpful.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Food is overpriced but, marginally, better than average. Very slow service cancels out any hope that the high prices are worth it. Waited 30+ minutes for a kid's hotdog, mac and cheese, PB&J and breakfast burrito...on a Monday. 35 minutes to be exact..."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Beautiful perfect location. However they can do better with lattes. A latte is not supposed to have frothy milk.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Honestly I have nothing to say about the quality of my Americano. The Vegan Nutter Butter was absolutely delicious.  My problem was with the service.  I came in around 4pm an it was pretty quiet, I ordered a triple shot Americano and asked if they had brownies and I was told no, but that they did suggest trying a Nutter Butter (delicious).  I was asked if the order was for here or to go and I explained that I would like it to go because I was waiting for a Lyft.  I sat down and waited for my beverage as the cashier then went on to chat with their coworker. I assumed they were not the barista so I just waited. Eventually I just noticed nothing was happening so I got up and asked how long for my food and drink.  Cashier: ""What are you waiting on?"" Me: ""Triple shot Americano and a Nutter Butter""  The cashier makes the Americano and serves it for dine in and walks away.  So I grab their attention again.  Cashier: ""Did you want something?” Me: ""I also ordered a Nutter Butter, oh, and this [Americano] was to-go""  They put my drink in a to-go cup and hand me the Nutter Butter and I leave.  What should have been at max a 5 minute interaction was over 15. I paid almost $13 after tip for this.  I will not be back."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I ordered a veggie sandwich for pickup and it was good quality, tasty, and ready when I arrived."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"One of my absolute favourites for a filling and healthy breakfast (or brunch) in Dolores Park. Tried a few options so far and overnight oats, veggie scrumble, turkey avocado sandwich and the cold press juices are great. Efficient service, clean and nice big window overlooking the park. It’s not cheap but worth it!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Atmosphere: great. beautiful views, great natural lighting, all-age friendly and spacious.  Location: perfect! Easy to find and within close proximity to public transport.  Food: limited plant-based / allergen-friendly items. While they can sub things out, don’t have a robust selection of full dishes which qualify.  They also charge extra for plant-based milks which means they get a few stars knocked off."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"This is my first time here, and based on my lunch I will be returning. It's nothing spectacular, just a good, solid cafe. My Spicy Tuna Melt, which came with kettle-style potato chips, was tasty. The iced tea is good.  The space is simple, with tasteful music that is set loud enough to add atmosphere but not so loud as to make conversation difficult. And the huge windows are great."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,A trendy and social environment in the Mission with the right noise level for socializing. The coffee and food met my expectations. Nice view of the park as well.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I was visiting SF from NY for my 21st b-day and this place was such a comfortable place to be to eat alone (and I've never done that before in a public setting) . I ordered the Italian pesto sandwich and a lemonade and it was AMAZING , quite literally my dream sandwich accompanied by delicious lemonade !"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Had just coffee and it was very good!!! :)
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Good vegan options including donuts. Very clean.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I love this place, they have sense of humor ( ""this restroom is for customers and unicorns only"" 🤣)and a good food which fair priced. Also they provide fresh, cold water for free. …"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Fluffy French toast with a nice drip coffee. Also can’t beat the vibe and the view of the Mission Dolores park.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Thai Iced Tea 95/💯!  Dolores Egg Sandwich 🥪 96/💯. \n  It's been a great #coffeeweek  🤝☕🙂 for me, and Thai Tea is a great substitute for when you're over-caffeinated btw. You can drink it here 😁 in a quiet setting with nice staff members! \n  Being in the same neighborhood as cool startup-y people is fun. And while it's tempting to allude more specifically whoever I may or may not have met this week, I've learned that discretion is the name of the game in #SF #SV... I used my  🧠 and my  📱  to understand this. \n  (disclosure: no relationship whatsoever with DPC, not even a loyalty member)"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Fantastic food. A little pricey, especially for juice drinks, and can get busy, so plan on being early or eating to-go."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I’ve had brunch here with friends 4-5 times and it’s been great every time.  Especially perfect for eating outdoors on days with nice weather.  I love the lox scramble, mimosas, and cocktails.  After filling up on food and drinks it’s lovely to go lay around the park, chill out, and digest.  I’ll definitely be back!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,LOVED my avo toast. Adorbs place with very nice staff. Obviously the location is great too.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"So, so bummed that they took the Thai bagel off the menu!! It was my favorite item and the reason I always went to this cafe for brunch 😭😭😭 I would give a 1 star for the menu change.  Otherwise still tasty, great coffee, nice employees. Can't fault for that 💕"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Awesome location, great staff, meh food.  We live nearby and really want DPC to be amazing; sadly it’s solidly “meh” in terms of food.  The best items we’ve found: - egg sandwich (great homemade English muffin) - kale smoothie  Most everything else we’ve tried is average to below-average. But we’ll keep coming back to keep the hope alive…"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Food was good and everyone there was nice except Nicole. She called a random name instead of mine and then yelled at me when I didn't reply (to a name that wasn't mine..?) :( and gave me the wrong food and then blamed me. She's also very rude to her coworkers I feel bad for them all because they all seemed nice. If she's going to yell at customers who tipped her she should not wear a necklace with her name on it. But yeah the food was good and so was every other employee!
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"They told me w a full confidence that churros do never come w chocolate, such an inflated attitude. And there was somebody's lipstick on my friend's cup"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Good Cafe, good coffee. Nice park adjacent. Street kids smoking pot up there were harmless."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Really good coffee and an almond croissant that left me wanting more. Very reasonably priced too. Service with a smile. What's not to like.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I've only been to Dolores Park Cafe a few times, but it's always bright and friendly (the space and the staff). Add coffee and a great oudoor section and what's not to like? Take a stroll through the park before orafter - or before AND after."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Beautifully arranged establishment in a beautiful spot. Food has been great every time with veggie and vegan options. Substantial menu selection with a mostly accommodating staff. Though sometimes when the lines get long they can get focused and a little chaotic, like most places. Highly recommended for a slow relaxing day when you aren't in a hurry and have time to take in the scenery."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Love this joint. Amazing location, friendly service and yummy bites.  Tad pricey for breakfast but it's well made and served.  Worth it for a seat to read and visit so close to the park."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"This is actually a nice place to eat.  They make great sandwiches, but two things makes me give them 2 stars.  One is their bathroom is often out of order.   I have been there theee times without the use of bathrooms.   If they serve food, they need to make sure the bathroom works.   Two, . Many transients visit this place, crazy scary people.    This is not their fault, but It is not uncommon to see a filthy guys grabbing some milk from the counter or walking into the cafe to find food."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Great place for snacks and coffee. Also when it’s not busy I like doing office work here
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great place to socialize, scenic views by the park. Pleasant service."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I just ate here for my first time and it was incredible. I had The Standard breakfast sandwich and it was amazing- open-face with perfect scrambled eggs, melted cheddar cheese and bacon strips- perfection. The coffee is from Equator which is my favorite brand, the latte I had was great. Every employee was gracious, warm and friendly- I'm so hooked already. GO!!!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"It's a vibe, mostly great because of the central location. If you ask for modifications to your green smoothie they can make it happen. I did get some unblended ice chunks though."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Had this delightful Vanilla Coffee had this Cafe.  Can´t get coffee as good as this in Iceland
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I ordered the granola and yogurt, expecting a mediocre, small cup of mostly yogurt and sub-par granola and fruit for more money than it was worth. I was so pleasantly surprised. The serving was not only a very gracious portion that was suitable to be an entire meal, but it was so fresh and delicious. There were mango cubes, sliced banana, and strawberries atop a beautiful and delicious homemade granola, surrounded by yogurt. My friends ordered egg dishes, and while they were good, we all agreed that I won the best breakfast! I only wish I had taken a photo, but it was so delicious that I’d go out of my way to return if I visit the city again!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great place to eat and people watch. Free Wifi that was easy to get on. Outdoor seating and seating inside with great windows and nice light. I ordered a Beet Salad. Perfect and simple. Huge chunks of beets, fresh delicious greens. Love this place!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Good food, good friendly service, GREAT location. You can't get much better than sitting next to one of the best parks in San Francisco while drinking a latte and reading a good book on a sunny day. Unless of course you were enjoying a glass of wine instead.  This place is centrally located in the heart of the Mission and worth a stop in."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"The food selection is good here. The location is awesome. The service is pretty good. It's cramped inside if it's busy, but the outside seating is nice if the weather is good. I suppose it would be nice to sit at the bar seats as well, but the tables inside feel very busy and cramped, especially if there's a long line at the cash register. That whole area feels a bit cramped though. I picture the line across the street at BiRight creamery which I have never stood in. Makes me want to run out into the park and enjoy the space."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"My friends and I came for brunch here and we really enjoyed it. The french toast was absolutely delicious. While the chairs are not the comfiest, the staff is really nice and it makes the experience worth it. It's a good place to stop by and pick up some food to take to eat at Dolores Park, which is located right across the street."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"We loved this little cafe across from Dolores Park. I have read other comments that the prices were high but I wonder what they are comparing the prices with.  The fresh pressed juice prices are similar to what I’ve paid elsewhere on East and West coasts.  Other prices are similar to elsewhere in San Francisco.  Ingredients are high quality, cafe gives back to the community and is quaint, comfortable and on a great little corner across from the  Dolores Park.  Outdoor seating too!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Comfortable, casual coffee house directly across from Dolores Park.  They have a nice mix of cafe classics, coffee house favs and healthy options.  I had a great pick-me-up of fresh squeezed juice (beet & ginger) and shot of espresso.  The crowd here is really laid back and friendly.  There's a decent amount of seating inside and out.  We liked the counter help - friendly, funny and quick!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Besides it's location next to Dolores Park, I think this place is a little overrated. Their food is good, but it's a pretty limited menu.  And, they have a lot of rules - no laptops at certain tables or at certain times and there was something about the bathroom. They get so much foot traffic through here that they just want to serve as many people as possible.  They don't seem to be looking to create a loyal local crowd."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,The outdoor patio seating and the large open windows with view of Dolores park and the high school get it 4 stars alone. Pretty pricey but that’s what you get for going to an upscale cafe on the corner of Dolores park. Pretty solid beer and wine selection as well for a post tennis or park beverage if you didn’t bring your own booze of choice to the park already.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"They got my order wrong in a few different ways, but service was great and they made the wrong right quick and easy. Coffee was super good and seating was perfect for a quick lunch outside."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Such a friendly place! This cafe is right next to Dolores Park which is one of our favorite places to hang out in SF. They menu has lots of options, all of which are good, and the staff is always amazingly friendly."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Love this Cafe! Across the street from Dolores Park makes it quite convenient. Food is good, reasonable prices, indoor & outdoor seating (great people watching), all sorts of drinks available, I could go on! Check it out if you've never been - it's a great place!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,I frequent this cafe several times a week because it's in my neighborhood. The food is very good. I love the staff! They have always been very friendly and helpful. I have mobility issues and they have always been kind enough to accommodate me.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Extensive organic menu and delicious, healthy and fresh food. They provide farmed chicken, ham, bacon and beef. Eggs they use are cage-free. Dolores Breakfast Sandwich was super good. There are assorted juices, coffees, teas, and healthy brunch options for customers."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Our waitress was the best. Steve Miller Chgo
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,The Panini sandwiches were good but the lemonade was too watered down. Cute cafe across from Dolores Park.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Grabbed coffee here many a morning and always enjoy it. Though I've never tried, the food always looks amazing and judging by all the happy customers must be worth the wait. Lots of Gluten Free options on the sweet front too."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,One of the most delicious and healthiest sandwiches ever !
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"This is a great neighborhood spot, with live music, a good happy hour and tasty food.  Dolores Park Cafe is the only place in the neighborhood I've found with a great bagel sandwich that can sate this former New Yorker and I was pleasantly surprised the first time I swapped the bagel out for a baguette, winner!  I always kind of snicker to myself on weekend mornings when I walk past all the people waiting in line at Tartine, grab my delicious breakfast at Dolores Park Cafe and head back home, seeing the same people still waiting in line."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Nice location and very busy on Saturdays. Parking is the usual kind of hell for this area. The food definately made up for it. The portions aren't really big but the food is all organic. The veggie scrambe was delicious so we their cobb salad.  Definately worth a visit if you're in the area.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I eat here almost every morning while waiting for my shuttle to work. Food is really good, staff is extremely friendly and helpful, overall a great environment to start my day. They make a damn good lox bagel."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Definitely a nice place to get a grab to eat and something to drink. I like the smoothies they have here, tastes fresh everytime. And it's right there close to the park so it's def a good place to go when you're planning on going to the park."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Loved outdoor/indoor sunny spaces. The food coffee's we're diverse and delicious.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great little coffee place / diner right next to Dolores Park - I usually get my Espresso fix there early in the morning and they do a fantastic, consistent job every day. It's uneventful and not as hipster as some might like it in this neighborhood but this makes me like them even more for it. Make sure to try their muffins if you can."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"This is the most 3 star I could ever make a review - it's right down the middle on everything - quality, price, atmosphere ... everything. If their location wasn't down-right incredible, they wouldn't survive, but when you're looking for a sandwich that will leave you satiated, at prices that aren't cheap but won't break the bank, this place is good."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"One of my favorite places for delicious cafe food. Entered near ten, it was not crowded. I had a cousin come into town and she asked me to go back here. It has a good interior."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,The beet salad was ok. I added chicken. Rather expensive.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Excellant food, healthy portions, and all at a good price. I received way more food than expected with the breakfast burrito. The potatoes had a good flavor and the location was very inviting."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,The menu is inclusive of all diets. The servings are generous and tasty. The atmosphere is always exciting to be part of when dining here.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Good selections for breakfast.   I like the bagel deluxe. Coffee served mugs, which is what I prefer.   Plenty of table and counter seating.   One of my favorites in Dolores Park neighborhood."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"There are three of the 'Park Cafe's' around the city and each one is absolutely fantastic. The food is of good quality, the atmosphere is beyond pleasant, the WiFi signal is strong, etc. It is always pleasant to visit and spend time. They serve Sight glass Coffee. I just wish they used Square so I wouldn't have to carry around receipts. It sits across the street from Bi-Rite Creamery so I often meetup with a friend to grab ice cream and sit in Dolores Park Cafe with coffee."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great food, drinks and love.y staff! It’s right across from Mission Dolores Park. Get it to go and sit in the park!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"This place is awesome - during the world cup, they would often have bottomless mimosas.  They also have a big selection of stuff, smoothies, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good and fairly priced."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Great location and tasty food, but overpriced for the portion sizes. The pesto scramble was basically 2 eggs, a thin slice of bread and a bite of watermelon for $13, and I was still hungry afterwards."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Cute cafe with a good section of salads and sandwiches. They also make custom smoothies. Vibe is clean, organic, and local. Tends to be very busy on weekends! They also have s sister location near by at Dubose Park."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I'm a huuuuge coffee drinker. I used to work as a barista when I was in uni for 4 years. So I'm obsessed with coffee. I went here today for a regular coffee and a double espresso for my mother in law.....the coffee was bitter. I couldn't even finish it. My mother in law asked me where I got the coffee cause she didn't like her espresso either. You would think that a place that charges so much would have quality coffee. I don't mind paying, but atleast give me something I'll enjoy.  Don't go there for just coffee. I hear the food is good!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I was in the area and needed to grab a cup of coffee.  It's a bit confusing when we walked in because I didn't see a menu any where.  The menu is set on the wall to the left, while the register is to the right.  All we can see is a list of bagel selections.  The place is clean and pretty quiet when we were there.  The air smelled of bacon which is a big plus."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Gorgeous views, absolutely the best spot for funday Sunday in the park. There is an adorable coffee shop across the street, fun shopping and restaurants just a few blocks down and a busy but friendly daily conglomerate of people, kids, and dogs."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Delicious coffee, nice Spanish music and friendly young staff"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"bakery was good, but coffee was very lacking. everything tasted watery and off putting. not worth it."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"ridiculous and annoying that they close the bathrooms for customers: this policy is just stupid and anticustomer service. never again!  Answering your reply: unfortunately thats not accurated with the reality, neither with what I was told at the restaurant (very unfortunate by the way!). See below: - There are many homeless and you try to avoid them come to your restaurant and use the bathrooms so you close them for everybody. -  It wasnt one person’s mistake from your staff, at least 4 people were hearing my complaining and they confirmed the fact. - The bathroom was not in maintenance ;) - If the problem is the high number of visitors during the weekend then close the terrace, the kitchen, the restaurant....such a bad excuse! The restaurant is open to make profit, customers should at least be able to use the ammenities, not just paying the bill ;) is that fair? - The restaurant was everything but full, I was the only person at the cashpoint and the only one who asked to use the bathrooms. So? - Easy solution: give the bathroom key to the customers who ask for it so they can use it. Problem fixed, isnt this fair and easy? - Even I insisted nobody helped me: terrible customer service, as poor as your answer. Better to apologize and find a better solution instead keep using terrible excuses  Thanks"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Good place to enjoy the Mission Dolores Park!
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Turkey avocado bacon sandwich was phenomenal!! Grilled cheese was delicious as well. Awesome 1st experience. Will definitely be back.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"The Damage: $30-40 for two  Neighborhood corner cafe that opens early, usually frequented by the nearby residents. We liked the Standard sandwich and their smoothies  ~~TRY😍: // Pear Smoothie // The Standard  ~~OKAY🙂: // Veggie Scramble  Follow us at IG: eatsmorefun"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"I really like this cafe. Bright and spacious, they serve an assortment of cafe amenities like coffee, pastries, and juice, as well as dinner and breakfast. They have an amazing egg n cheese sandwich which you gotta try!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"A few years ago on a sunday afternoon, my family came to visit me from Guatemala and I decided to take them to this cafe a few streets down from my neighborhood. My family found a good table.  I was in line ready to order, talking and laughing with my father about old times, when we were told by a staff member to keep our voices down. We complied despite it being lunchtime and a crowd of people were chatting with beers in their hands. My father quietly walked toward  the bulletin board while I stayed in line when the same staff member began to yell and scream at the top of her lungs that my father could not wait in line to use the bathroom. My father used the bathroom in my home before we arrived so I was a little confused. The staff member was irrate and hostile and boldly put her hands on my father who is in his 60s and forced him to go outside. The rest of my family was in shock as my father was absolutely humiliated in front of them. When i began to speak up about the matter i was met with having the police called on my family for TRESPASSING!!!  She had a huge grin on her face as she said this. We left.  Not only have i never returned to this cafe, I also try to avoid walking near it while on my way to work. You will mever see mee step foot in this establishment ever again."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Really busy and buzzing cafe. Had a K2 smoothie and a chicken sandwich, both were pretty yummy. Nice place to get some respite from the warm weather and people watch. Not the place to be if you are seeking for peace and quiet."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,Great pastrami on rye. Although I would've enjoyed a little more sauerkraut. Service was very good also
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Early cold morning. Sunrise. Chai tea, skim milk. Neither were charred by carelessness. Hot, but drinkable. Big warm glass to wrap my cold fingers around. Daily special chorizo burrito is delicious. The eggs aren't overcooked and the pico is fresh. The people in service are genuine. What a pleasure to start my day this way in the City."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Cute little cafe with food, soft drinks and alcohol. Right across from the park so great to grab something and head to the park. Sage spritzer was delicious!"
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,I'm surprised that everyone isn't ranting and raving about this place. If you're looking for a lighter breakfast but healthy and filling then this is definitely the place to be in Mission. I wouldn't recommend driving at all but it's worth the walk.
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"8.04 for a dirty Chai that was finished by the same person that took My order in less than a minute (literally counted back the 96 cents) ,  tasted like cinnamon and a dash of lukewarm milk on top of a drip coffee ... have been here a dozen times or so and always nearly good or not at all."

Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"An awesome place to chill and meet new people! It's also fairly clean and the grass is well maintained. There's street parking around the area, but don't expect to find a spot right away."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,"Line is slow moving.  Seating area is noisy and too public. Juice was like 10 oz., too small for the price.  I got up to refill my hot water and another patron was taking my chair after only a minute.  Really congested."
Dolores Park Cafe,501 Dolores St,A little expensive but really good red eye chocolate smoothie. I wish it was thicker and creamier. Clean bathrooms.
