Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere only tried there espresso but plan retuning to try there sandwiches
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"Pretty good coffee, very reasonable prices, great place to work, good place to study. Have spent some great moments in this cafe and will always be grateful. The host is always very welcoming and gracious, and gave me water like 5 times even though I just bought one coffee and stayed for a 2 hours-long meeting. The snacks are not inexpensive, but they taste good. There is also a beautiful area outside, but it gets extremely chilly in the winters.  However: -It can get loud, might not for you for studying if you like quiet, library-like environments. -The restroom is a little smelly. -There are a bunch of people smoking and gambling post 7:30pm, in case that bothers you."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"A great place to stop for bite to eat.  The smell emanating from their kitchen in the early morning is like something out of story books.  The restaurant is locally owned and ran, and they have an extensive menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It has that old fashioned diner feel, with pieces of hand drawn artwork on the walls.  Highly recommend."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,I lived for a while in NYC so I wasn’t expecting much but these breakfast bagels are absolutely delicious. I got the Indian style breakfast bagel with melted cheese on a poppy seed bagel and will definitely be coming back soon.
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"Food is good, but some times strangely slow (like drinks). Would be better if there weren't so many homeless people sitting in the outdoor seating directly by the entrance."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Ordered bagel with lox. Received salad on a bagel with four full lemons squeezed onto it.
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Had cafe latte from here and loved it. The staff is also friendly.
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"One of my favorite neighborhood spots. The cafe is right below my apartment, I've been coming here for 5 years. Great coffee and people. Staff are really friendly. Enjoy the patio on a nice day. Try The Fillmore breakfast sandwich and the Buffalo Chicken sandwich on a French roll. Their Espresso will wake you right up too."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Really good bagels sandwiches and the place seems like a great neighborhood spot. I had the lox bagel
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Ahhhhhh man! OK SO .... CHOCOLATE CHAI !!!! ...😲 OMG dude for real... Sooooooo good ... deliciously decadent.  Yes so I loved it totally caught me by surprise and was so much better than I had expected like nothing I've ever tasted b4. honestly I'm not big on coffee or tea let alone chai. But I lucked out on this one and think I've found a new favorite.  ThAnk you for much for a great breakfast and excellent customer service.  Matthew Coleman •VII•
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"A friend of mine and I went to grab sandwiches from here in the morning and they sandwiches were delicious. I've also come here in a group and with another friend just to have a cup of hot chocolate. Each time I've come, the atmosphere has been positive. The cashiers and food preparers are also expedient."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"Family owned operation here with the nicest people staffing. Tip: Order an egg bagel sandwich (or on bread); it's made fresh using a pan, not a microwave. That's al but disappeared from restaurant menus. It comes like an omelette, nice and browned. They also have WiFi for free. Just ask for password."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"$8.70 for ham,egg,cheese crossiant to go...I hope it is tasty for that price..I live in the Fillmore Center too...was hoping to make this a regular place.. Safeway deli is for sure half the price...Right?  Love supporting local but overpriced rent and overpriced breakfast too :("
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Beyond the nicest people there!! Such kind simple hearted people.  Great memory and now they remember what I order just hearing my voice.  Delicious Veggie garden burger and excelent side dishes (salad or potato salad or chips).  My favorite place to eat when im feeling lazy!
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Home-made style healthy food!
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Employees had no life to them. Got a pastry that was MOLDY and they were not even apologetic and barely cared when it was returned. Got a cafe mocha that tasted fine but had weird solid bits at the bottom. Never returning!
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"You have to remember, these are Eritreans and Ethiopians running what they think is an American cafe.  Get the Faoul Maddamus (sp?). It’s a solid meal for $10 and you can’t find it at most places. They sell the special spongy bread separately. Spend $5 for a package of the stuff and eat the dish the way it was meant to be eaten. Or with the standard American bread it comes with, can’t go wrong either way.  The bbq chicken sandwich was good. No complaints and I recall the taste with fondness."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,This small place packs a large punch of goodness. Friends in town the perfect quick breakfast. I actually had the quiche which was marvelous. Others had the egg sandwitches which were also tastey. Last but not least the coffee was fantastic...a must see.
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"The sandwiches are awesome at Fillmore Cafe. These guys really try to accommodate for my picky orders. I usually get the Chicken sandwich, and they give a side, either macaroni, potato, or Cesar Salad. You can also get chips. I eat here about 4 times a week, and it beats subway any day."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"The interior isn't very impressive, but their food packs a punch. Great sandwiches and breakfast bagels and reasonable prices. The service is quick, if a bit curt. We'll definitely be back."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"Great place! Good food, drinks, service. Would be a hands-down 5 star cafe but lots of smoking goes on right outside the door, so be ready to breathe that in."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"Fantastic Cafe! Makes you feel right at home no matter where you’re from. Beer or coffee, wine or smoothies, bagels or steaks. Warm and flavorful coffee. Lemon sliced full bodied corona."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"We came upon this great cafe by chance and were really impressed. No frills, but delicious, carefully prepared food. The staff were exceptionally pleasant. Will definitely go back."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Lovely people. Everytime I come to SF to see my boyfriend we come here.. admittedly their English is a little poor but they always make and effort to provide a great a service and the coffee is nice
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"I got a coffee and a bagel with egg and cheese, and both were pretty good, and the location is great"
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,So delicious I love it
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"Food was terrible! The bagels were old, chicken was over cooked and didn't have flavor at all and the tables were filthy, if you're thinking of going to this place, do your self a favor and don't."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Must try the chai tea
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,"One of the few affordable cafes in SF. The hot chocolate chai is a must have, nowhere else makes it as delicious as here. All breakfasts made to order as well."
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Delicious drip coffee and fresh bagels but lots of single use and/or noon recyclable plastic so can't give 5*
Fillmore Street Cafe,1301 Fillmore St,Don’t bother with this place you could go to the Safeway next door get the ingredients for half the price and make a sandwich in half  He time literally spent half an hour waiting this morning. Live next door but will never come here again.
