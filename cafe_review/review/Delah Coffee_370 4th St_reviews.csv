Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I came in curious about the baklava, but was pleasantly surprised about their selection of sweets. I am unfamiliar with most of their menu items, thus randomly ordering an iced Habibi (light sweet). It was not too sweet, and there was some spiced kick to it that I liked, and differentiated from regular American coffee. The baklava was so good and moist, less flaky than I expected, but I would get it again and curious about their other desserts! Overall, coming into this cafe felt like discovering an indie band before it blew up."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I’ll need to return if only to try the different types of drinks, especially the rose latte.   I ordered the Yemeni latte, which has cardamom and cinnamon.  Reminiscent of chai, not as complex, just as enjoyable.  I also had a piece of the rose milk cake.  Sponge like, very moist, and not overly sweet.  Perfect with the latte."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,This was my first time trying a Turkish coffee and it was delicious! I didn't realize that there were spices in the coffee but it was a pleasant surprise. The coffee is strong but very smooth. The atmosphere here is very cozy and welcoming.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"This cafe has huge selections, and it’s nice to finally try a Mediterranean cafe. They have a lot of pastries that look really delish! We got the Bee Bites and Turkish Caramel Milk Cake - both are amazing! The Bee Bites is like a beehive with cream cheese inside and they sprinkle it generously with honey. Turkish Caramel Milk cake tastes like tres leches but the sweetness is perfect, not too sweet.  For coffee, we got our staple: mocha latte. Right amount of chocolate and sweetness. Seems like they brew their own coffee too.  Service is nice and quick, and the servers are sweet. The overall ambiance is great too. Not too loud, I see a lot of folks working or people catching up.  Will definitely go back here."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Definitely one of the best coffee shops out there! Excellent hours, great service, delicious desserts, and yummy adeni chai and other caffeinated drinks! They also treat their loyal customers super well and may offer complimentary dessert!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I rate 4/5 only coz I reserve 5 for exceptionally best places. But this place is very nice. Gets points for.opeming early and staying open late till 10pm most days (9pm only on Sundays). A wide variety of sweet treats, coffee/tea are available. I had the Adeni Chai, one of the offered Yemeni teas, and the Biscoff Milk Cake - a nice treat after dinner. My friend got the Saffron Cake; the saffron was muted, but tasted good nonetheless. My friends then also surprised me with the Rose Milk Cake as a birthday treat, which tasted great too. It was also pleasant to hear happy birthday sung by the entire crowd in both English and Arabic. Overall, friendly place, good food; will be going back!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,The Yemeni latte taste various kinds of spices like cardamon(maybe?). Very flavorful and tasty. I want to try their pastry next time!
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Fairly standard Yemeni coffee shop. Great place to get some work done. Very busy though. Waited behind one person for 10 minutes just to order. Even though I waited 10 minutes to order, my drink was quick to come out, maybe only taking 30 seconds. Awesome! Adeni Chai is like a karak chai. Their recipe is quite strong in the cardamom department, but still a fantastic drink. Try this place out and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Pretty good middle Eastern coffee and pastry place. The lattes are alright, coffee flavor light and the ginger seemed like powdered inside. The cheese pastry was rich and tasty for the first few bites, resembles a pizza but with pastry sheet. Good vibes and great service"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Love the vibe. Staff was super nice.  I would 100% recommend to stop by and try out the veriet of tea/coffee/ chai selection.  Desert were delecious. Place was super packed.  It was worth the wait.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Variety of seating, outlets and wifi available, assortment of sweet and savory bites as well as both traditional and specialty hot and cold beverages. Music is a little loud for taking work calls but is a good option for just working. Gets busy before 10 and again around 4."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Super cool spot, so glad I visited!  Bee Bites disappeared fast - I was pleasantly surprised by how light they were, and they weren't too sweet as the only sweetness came from the drizzled honey. Although they heated it up, it was barely warm so I'd like to try it again toasted!  Friend got the cheese slice and that was also lovely - imagine a light, mozzarella-esque cheese wrapped in layers of flaky pastry.  We also tried the pomegranate saffron pistachio Turkish delight and it was... Delightfull!!! It was sweet, but I really enjoyed it. Loved the dense texture. Reminded us of Swedish Fish 😋  My friend declared their chai may be the best in SF and I might agree! Lightly sweetened with a great balance of spices (not overpowered by cloves as it often is when you ask for spicy > sweet).  Nice seating and ambiance too. Can't wait to go back!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"A great coffee shop—both for the delicious Yemeni latte and the cafe ambiance. This was a wonderful place to work and read, and particularly helpful that they’re open late every day (10pm). Can’t wait to try some of their pastries because they looked incredible!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I like their latte, cheesecake and bread type of dessert which is served with honey very much. Their baklava could've been better.  I very much appreciate that they're open till late at night. Staff are friendly and polite. The coffee shop itself is cozy and pleasant.  I strongly recommend that they install some powerful fans so that the customers don't smell the strong oil smell coming out of the kitchen. Also, I've noticed that they spray their fridge while the food is still in it. So the pastries get sprayed as well, which is not healthy at all!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,A wonderful addition to the Bay Area. Delah offers a selection of yemeni tea which is great to share with loved ones. The lotus cheesecake is definitely a favorite and doesn’t miss. Would love to see a location in the peninsula!
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"It's nice place to hang out, with friends, family and fur-friends. Yes, it's dog friendly and you can calm your soul with a variety of sweet delights available here, also there Indian Masala Chai is way better than chai served at most of the Indian Restaurants."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"What a cafe to start with... amazing ambiance.. ordered small chai teapot, with lotus cheese cake( it was yummy), almond croissant, and banana muffin..."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"This coffee shop is absolutely amazing. Every single drink on the menu is so flavorful, you can’t go wrong with any of them. Plus the desserts are delicious — we got the pistachio milk cake."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Had the adani chai and kawah mostafzar and they were both pretty good. The bee bites were nice and overall the coffee place is a very nice place that gets full pretty early and is a nice place for a morning bite!
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Such a cool and authentic place! Super friendly staff and it got so busy! Love the Turkish coffee
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Absolutely amazing coffees and teas, and they close super late (compared to SF hours at least). Amazing place to get some work done in a lively atmosphere!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Cozy Yemeni coffee shop with coffee and pastries served here. Mostly young crowds. People are friendly here and they chat, play boardgames or just work on laptops. They provide plenty of tables and chairs to accommodate clients. Very nice place."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,A colleague of mine recommended this place to us. We loved it. Yemeni latte tests read good. A five star.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,We loved everything about this shop. The croissants and Turkish delight pastries were delicious and I was so impressed with the Yemeni latte. The people working there were also so nice and they even gave us a complimentary plate of cream cheese filled pastries with honey drizzle. I had never had anything like them and thought they were amazing! We could not recommend this place any more highly 😁
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Yemenese style coffee! Their offerings are steeped with cardamom, ginger, and other spices. Also their middle eastern pastry selection is unmatched in the city. Great addition to the neighborhood."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"This place is amazing, my favorite is the Yemeni latte. Flavorful coffee and pastries. Nice warm decor. The staff are so nice and welcoming. I enjoy my time every time I come here."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"This place is awesome. We tried the semolina saffron cake and the cheese pastries and they were all delicious. The saffron cake melts in your mouth and it is the right amount of sweetness. I like the authentic feel of the coffee shop, the Aidan Chai has a good flavor of cardamom and last but not least and the staff is very welcoming."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Absolutely  the best coffee that I had in years. The yemeni ginger coffee was something very different but very delightful also had they're we pistachio milk cake and the caramel cheesecake, those are only few items I tried so far but guaranteed the rest of they're menu would be fabulous. I tried they're ice cooler drinks and those are very refreshing on a warn day plus the staff was friendly and helpful with any question you may have. Must come back again ."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"We were lucky to go on the grand opening day, it was busy but luckily we found a table. We had a good experience at Delah Coffee shop. The dessert were delicious and the Yamani latte was so good. The great thing about this coffee shop that they close late unlike the other places. They close 10PM everyday and 9PM on Sundays. I will definitely go back soon."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Was so nice to visit delancy especially after having been to Socotra - beautiful murals and really large coffee for the price! Very friendly service too.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"The coffee was nice and good but I didn’t love the place overall because of few reasons. We took two drinks, that’s a rose latte and a chai but both of the mugs in which they served were broken which didn’t give me a feeling of coming out and paying extra to get that feeling of drinking the best coffee. Also the place was too crowded even for a weekday and people were screaming at the top of their voices which appalled me"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"There's a focus on quality that you can really appreciate in every cup.  They have a strong spice flavor to their Yemeni espresso blend, a solid flavor similar to other African Arabica origin blends."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Delah Coffee has amazing Yemeni twists on your favorite lattes. I had a cardamom latte that was perfection in combination with almond stuffed croissants. I highly recommend taking the time to sit inside and enjoy their coffee in-house as their dishware is SO beautiful and their sitting very comfortable.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Delah is a newer Yemeni coffee shop and serves ""Originality Arabic coffee"".  Its open at a former Peet's!  Not your typical "" hipster"" spot.  The Yemeni latte was filled with spices including cinnamon and cardamom.  The type of coffee that makes you just want to sit down and relax each sip.  The Rose Milk Cake was moist and reminded me of a light slightly rose flavored tree leches cake.  Not too sweet or not too much rose flavors. Simply delicious. Get it!  Love the coffee culture here and how the shop is open late.  Very nice and friendly staff.  Comfortable aesthetics and ambiance.  Feels like im transported to somewhere distance and far away, Yemen.  Definitely will be back to try other delicious drinks and desserts!  Parking a bit difficult"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,The Rose Latte is the best thing I’ve ever tasted! The richness of rose and complimentary herbs is perfection. Def recommend
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Ever been to Istanbul? No matter if you’re in San Francisco and jonesing for some Turkish Coffee there’s a wonderful spot called Delah Coffee that will satisfy your cravings! Small bites, exotic coffees and teas, along with the more commercial drinks fill the menu. The vibe is welcoming with decor that flows with the theme. I came with a friend and we both ordered the Yemeni Latté and was blown away by its flavor! We also ordered Pistachios Baklava and authentic savory bites which all paired nicely with our drinks. On the pricy side for a coffee shop, but know this ain’t your typical Starbucks…"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Can’t wait for their Oakland shop to get up and running.  I went through 5 pastries and 2 coffees. The atmosphere was bright and chic. The food was delicious, the coffee satisfying, and the owner/staff were quite pleasant."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Happy to have this so special place 10 min walk from my house. It became our meeting point with friends because everyone who visited it once became a real fan of the place. I love it for the unique mid eastern ambiance which comes from beautiful tableware, tiles, paintings and of course very nice stuff. I would recommend to try their Delah Quahwan coffee and of course baklava and Turkish delight."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I had my first Yemeni Latte without sugar and I think I’m in love with it. Update after a couple months; traditional coffee set, cortado, cheese cake and soft hazelnut roll with cinnamon coated with spice."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Nice place for an afternoon pick me up. Came here as part of my quest to try different coffee shops all over. Loved their selection of pastries and cakes. We tried the Rose Milk cake and the Pistachio milk cake and the first one was way better. Apparently, it’s their most popular cake too. For drinks, we tried Americano (nothing special) and the Delah Malwar (medium roast with cream and cardamom; it was good and came unsweetened).  Friendly staff and helpful in answering any questions you might have especially if you’re unfamiliar with the items.  Overall, worth stopping by to try. If you’re in the area, check them out."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,You want to have a special traditional COFFEE. I can’t tell the flavor I experienced. I will be here another day.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Amazing cafe in SF! Every pastry was out of this world. I had a lot of these in Turkey, and this was the best versions I had so far! Great Yemeni cafes and chai as well!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I was recommended the Yemeni latte and it was delicious, strong cardamom flavor. Also ordered the bee bites and sabyah, which are warm Yemeni pastries drizzled with honey. I will definitely frequent this place, especially given the convenient hours!  EDIT: I wrote this review when Delah first opened, but I’ve been coming here regularly for several months now so wanted to add to this. This place has gotten very popular and has the perfect vibe for a chill hangout with friends while drinking coffee/tea and sharing a dessert. I highly recommend any of the milk cakes and sharing a pot of one of their signature drinks. If you want something that’s served in the traditional pot (the “delah”), order the Arabic Qahwah."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Was wishing for coffee for the drive home, but the Bay Area is a big city that closes up early. 🌁💤 Imagine my delight when I discovered Delah Coffee just two blocks from the reading! They are new and staying open until 9:30 for now, but hope to expand to midnight. Cute cafe space and delicious desserts! 🥳🎉 I am so happy with my Saná Ani coffee with cardamom and my pistachio milk cake. Everyone come support this spot so it's still here next time I make it out! 😀"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,New and unique Arabic style coffee shop.  It is very busy on a Saturday afternoon.  Lots of Arabic pastries.  I will definitely go again to try other things.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I just discovered this absolutely, amazingly wonderful coffee shop.  The staff is young and wonderfully friendly and stupendously cute and polite.  They highly honor females and old ladies like me.  I am a former supervisor of 160 plus aerospace engineers and technicians.  I was known as the hatchet lady.  I would have hired the staff at Delah and am absolutely sure that I would never have regretted doing so.  The place is spotless, inside and out.  A person does not need to memorize a code to use the restroom, which is also spotless.   The staff are mostly college students who will obviously go far."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,First time I've had a Yemeni Latte and it was delicious. Great atmosphere for a coffee shop. There were so many sweets I wanted to try but it was too early in the morning for me
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"The iced habibi and saffron cake are life affirming. If you’ve been to New York’s Qahwah house, I assure you this place is better. The Saudi guy who helped us was awesome. We will definitely be returning."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"this place gets packed but people working remotely so tough to find seats sometimes! friendly staff and love the cups they use. however, i saw some rat traps behind some chairs which is a little concerning…  good lattes and would highly recommend the milk cakes. they’re the perfect sweetness and reminded me of a tres leches cake."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Great neat cafe! Beautiful atmosphere and beyond satisfactory customer service. I love the idea that this cafe is spotless clean, organized, and well decorated!  For the drinks, we got Mofawar, Adani Chai, and Yemeni Latte. All of them were amazing! Perfect balanced sweetness and coffee blend (if you ask for it with sugar). You can tell the coffee is fresh and made with care.  For the desserts, we had “Bee Hive” topped with honey, oh boy what a beautiful combination. The “Bent AlSahan” is delicious as well.  Great job for this beautiful cafe A++. Will definitely come back while in that area."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,I loved visiting Delah coffee! The chai was amazing and we tried the pistachio milk cake and some of the breakfast pastries which were both delicious. Everyone was really friendly and happy to answer all my questions. Such a great vibe and I’m already looking forward to going back!
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Their specialty lattes and rose cakes were amazing! Melted in my mouth. Full of spice and flavors so different to the boring ones you get at Starbucks or Peets coffee. Must try.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Have wait for customer meeting, found this cafe in very broken side of San Francisco. Staff are nice, new kind of coffee/ food (from Yemen) for me. Will test it"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Finally the first Arabic/Yemeni coffee in the Bay area , the place is well designed & organized. I like the arabic chairs in corners , the coffee latte is has amazing taste remind me of home made Yemeni coffee. Sure will come back again."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Always excited when a new spot opens up in the hood…esp a coffee joint! And boy this place does not miss!!  The Yemeni latte was superb..the perfect blend of spices, espresso, honey, and milk and not overly sweet. It was a great complement to the pistachio baklava and kinafa w/ rose petals which were both pretty solid but the pistachio baklava was just HEAVENLY. Each bite would just melt in your mouth.  The interior is spacious for a cafe, seating approx 15-20 people with some pretty comfy cushion-y spots along the walls. The owner (?) was very friendly and took the time to give us recommendations based on our likes. Seems like they still have a couple kinks to iron out as they forgot my friend’s order, but no biggie.  Next time am definitely gonna try the bee bites, yummm"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"The place is open till late at night, and it has a wonderful ambiance that you can enjoy. It doesn’t feel like San Francisco, once you enter Delah coffee you are magically transported to another continent. I would recommend getting their Turkish coffee for here, or Yemeni Latte to go. They offer oat milk. The staff is friendly and explain their menu with great patience."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Wow, LOVE the Yemeni Latte and its flavors of cardamom and cinnamon. Amazing selection of pastries, including some Western-style scones, bagels. But I recommend coming here to try something new and delicious."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Yemeni latte is delicious and strong--makes you want to sit and actually enjoy your coffee. Beautiful cups. Vibrant and loud atmosphere.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,The decor and all is beautiful but coffee was ok.  I had a cappuccino.  Felt like there was too much milk because the cup was huge.  Maybe serve smaller portions like a 7oz cup instead of 12oz.  Majority of the bakery items were sweet.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Finally a coffee place which is open late and has good quality middle eastern snacks.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Great atmosphere for working and drinking coffee. Yemeni latte and rose cake were amazing! One of my favorite coffee shops in SF now
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,The bee bite is rly good! But the potato bread is horrible 😞
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Its a nice turkish coffee shop. We had the Yemeni Latte and the chai. It was something unique, not the normal lattes we have, had nice aromatic spices. We also tried the saffron milk cake and pistachio baklava which were also very fresh and decadent."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Delha Cafe is a hidden gem that deserves all the praise for its exceptional culinary offerings. The star of the show is undeniably their Rose Milk Cake, an absolute delight for the taste buds. This heavenly creation combines the delicate flavors of rose with a moist and fluffy cake, leaving you craving for more. Delha Cafe has mastered the art of creating delectable treats, and their Rose Milk Cake is an absolute must-try for anyone with a sweet tooth."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Flavorful coffee with a spiced twist and mouth-watering pastries. The pistachio baclava is simply the best. I recommend sitting inside as it’s the perfect place to slow down and catch up with a friend over coffee.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"This place was CRAZY busy at 2 pm on a Thursday. Lots of people working on their laptops and many others chatting with friends....it was a bit loud and at times felt too crowded with people waiting for tables at the edges of the room. It was during a gaming conference at Moscone, so that could have been why it was extra busy. The coffee was great and the baked goods looked amazing! I'll definitely go back because the menu is extensive and everything looks great!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Randomly went here to grab chai. Tried Yemeni chai, tea, and the coffee with ginger cardamom cloves. All pretty good, it is strong. I normally drink turkish tea or green tea but these were different. Also tried the baklava, very tasty and well made. Also ordered the pistachio cake, didn’t like it as it was too sweet"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Fun experience to share a pot of coffee(~$20 total)! The spiced favor was very interesting but not something I would want to drink everyday.  The place itself had plenty of tables to sit down although it was loud and a little crowded to be a good working environment. Would recommend going here to fun alternative to a standard coffee catch up with friends.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Super busy you might not find a table!  But I love their signature coffee (Yemeni Latte) specially if you have a sweet tooth, came back for it 😁  I loved the classic and rose tres leches cake"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Tried the yemeni traditional coffee and (forgot what it’s called but looks like the picture! You can’t miss it) coffee was so so good. Strong with cardamom. The pastry was melt in your mouth. The place is right across whole foods. Recommend 👍🏼 …
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I ordered coffee and waited for about ten minutes, but no one called me.  When I asked the staff working there if my coffee was not ready yet, she pointed to two cups of coffee that were completely cold.  When I told him that these coffees are cold, she shrugged her shoulders very rudely and said that it is your problem.  Even the sweets did not taste good and were too sweet to at least reduce the rudeness of the staff by eating sweets."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I fall in love with this place 😍 the details was amazing. We try the bee bites, adeni tea, adeni coffee, delah mofawar ice coffee and the most try milk cake it's so delicious 😋"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,The saffron cake was not as great as hyped. The coffees were great. I tried the yemini specialty offerings. The place does get crowded but worth trying something different. All savory options were out by the time we reached at 11:30AM on a Saturday morning.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Try ordering but received no understanding from cashier when I asked for regular black coffee, coffee menu is not clear what you are getting and when I asked for clarification they made me feel I like I was wasting their time.  Then my coffee took way too long to make and my parking meter was running out and I could not extend the meter.  I had to walk out of frustration and then came back and they finally started making my coffee.  Is it that they are rude or are they wanting to make me wait on purpose.  I will not be coming back plus I did not get anything that taste like coffee, it tasted like with cardamom sorry but at least Starbucks gets it right."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Great place to hang out! The staff is really nice and friendly, they make a great Yemeni Latte, and the pastries are delicious! Love that they’re open late!"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Very delicious coffee and treats. A great place to meet friends or bring over some visiting family. Staff is always very friendly.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Beautiful cortado espresso drink ☕️ and friendly staff. They just opened yesterday on the day of the Warriors parade. There are cakes 🍰 along with sweet and savory pastries. I grabbed a flaky phyllo dough type pastry with a side of honey. The tiny cheese ball pastries also caught my eye. Next time… …
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"My absolute favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. The hours are incredibly convenient, the coffee is distinct & flavorful, and there's a wide variety of delicious pastries + desserts."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"You're paying for the ambiance, especially if you're familiar with Middle Eastern and Khaleeji coffee/sweets. Limited parking and cramped seating. To-go orders added to the crowdedness and should be streamlined. Rose latte lacked any rose & coffee flavor, but the shared teapot was a highlight. Saffron milk cake tasted freezer burnt and lacked saffron flavor, not worth the cost.  I would come back here only to get the shared teapot with friends if I'm too lazy to make tea myself."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I am so glad to see a place like this in SF. Finally a coffee shop that doesn’t end at 3 pm like everywhere else. Their Yemeni latte is to die for. Great assortment of desserts, this spot will become an SF must-try one day."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Great service. Nice place. However, coffee was not that good"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Very aromatic Aisien black tea with almond milk. I cannot spell or pronounce this drink (feedback: could change it to make it easier to order than fumble) good stuff they do have plant-base 🌱 (oat, almond and soy) milk"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,I got the Rose Latte and I was so glad that they had oat milk. This place is super busy so finding a spot to sit might be tough but I loved the drink and the overall atmosphere of the shop!
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"SF needs more middle eastern food / coffee, and this place has really cemented its place in the city. The iced Yemeni latte is awesome 🙌🏽 …"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,This place has amazing coffee and great customer service. Will definitely come back.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"This is the best Yemen Latte I’ve ever  had. Rich flavor, that turkish coffee base… delicious 🤌 Certainly is a “must visit” place if You happen to be in SoMa See You soon lattér"
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Not your commercial coffee shop. They make coffee an Arabic experience with amazing pastries. Unique flavors that will make you come back.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"I dropped by today at this new coffee shop, the environment was very welcoming and organized, I loved the combination of both modern and traditional design. I ordered a mangorabian and it was spectacular, I also loved the great smell of the fresh coffee that I'll try in my next visit."
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,Amazing food really good coffee the person making all that was super nice the place was also super stylish. I wish there was one where I lived.
Delah Coffee,370 4th St,"Got green tea, which is hot water + tea bag. It was 12$ for two. I got the same order a week ago it was 4.5$ for two. It was wired when I asked why they said 16oz???"
