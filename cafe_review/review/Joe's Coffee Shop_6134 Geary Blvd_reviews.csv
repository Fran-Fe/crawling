Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Sometimes you don’t want a fancy brunch place where they serve deconstructed matcha pancakes or some other dish designed to appeal to IG than your tastebuds.  Sometimes you just want pancakes with eggs, sausage, and hash browns served at a local no-frills diner run by a friendly elderly couple. And you’re safe in knowing that it may not be fancy, but it’s more delicious than what a lot of fancy places are serving for much higher prices."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,This cozy coffee house is my go-to spot for a relaxing break. Their exceptional variety of coffee blends and delicious pastries never disappoint. The warm ambiance and welcoming staff create a perfect environment to unwind or catch up with friends.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"A local guru of cheap and worth it, took me out for breakfast to Joe's. Miss Becky was our server and hostess, she was very gentil and the food was excellent; and indeed, the prices are great for SF! It is so quaint, a true hidden gem🥰🕊️♻️"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,Nice local little diner. My bf is a regular here. I had a delicious shrimp omelette. Good coffee. Cash only.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,This place is the best. Just a simple diner. No muss no fuss. Cheap eggs and crispy bacon with fresh coffee. Food comes out wicked fast. Even when they're busy you don't wait long. Quick service and gives you that small town feel.  CASH ONLY THOUGH!  Also don't expect any typical sf mods like gluten free bread or soy milk LOL. They keep it simple. And I love it.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,Great little greasy spoon for breakfast.  Brought in fam of 4 and had the classics.  Cute little couple runs the place and is just serving up the simple breakfasts you’d find in any diner.  Loved it and we will be back!
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Classic diner run by (it seemed) a family,  providing warm service and really fresh food. Even the melon in my side dish of fruit was sweet and ripe, as if prepared for a family member rather than a customer. Will be back."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"So good, food comes out so fast, everything was amazing, great hash browns and delicious pancakes 🥞 …"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"If you’re looking for good old fashioned breakfast, look no further! The embodiment of simplistic perfection. Perfectly cooked over medium eggs is a rarity 😉 5  stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,Small cafe run by friendly olde couple the food was good specially the blueberry pancakes.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Exactly what you want from a no-frills, straightforward diner. Good food, good prices"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"My husband and I stop by at least once a week (usually the weekends) early in the morning when we take our daughter out for a stroll. I love that this place opens super early because it's either here or Starbucks. As much as I like Starbucks, I actually prefer this place much more. I usually order the latte and it has been consistently good. My husband has tried few other drinks and he said all the drinks he has had has been pretty good. The staff here are friendly and welcoming. We definitely love this place and always recommend this place to our friends.."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"You'll notice that all the photos here are either of the food or the front window. That's because this street joint has zero atmosphere but fantastic food. It's a tiny, no-nonsense oasis in what's become the tech-bro and hipster heaven of Central Richmond."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,This is a simple mom and pop breakfast spot. Joe and his son cook consistently well. I've never been disappointed with the food...a nice neighborhood place.....
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Tiny mom&pop place, a little worn but almost every seat was taken, so we were thinking it must be good. We were not disappointed. Food came very quickly and was delicious!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"This is my favorite place for a traditional greasy spoon breakfast, especially after a party. The options are simple and they are consistently delicious. Their eggs are always cooked perfectly, the pancakes and waffles are great, and their omelets are large and filling. Their prices are reasonable and you can still get away spending less than $10 per person before tip. It is really really great"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"One of a dying breed, Joe's Coffee Shop is the real thing, a no frills Mom & Pop breakfast diner.  Good simple eats at good low price.  Having breakfast here is the highlight of my day."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"This place is very local and family-oriented.  There aren't many seats (there's a bar-style table and two tables for groups and a couple of single or double tables).  The pancakes were good.  Unfortunately, this place is a real breakfast and lunch type of restaurant, so it's closed very early.  The hash browns were good and the eggs were made nicely.  I believe the omelettes were the best thing I have ordered yet."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Don’t expect much for ambiance or decor. But if you want a classic American breakfast fast, come here.  I got the 2 bacon, 2 egg, 2 toast plate. Crispy bacon, fluffy scrambled eggs, and all I needed.  It’s not your trendy coffee joint for Instagram but I like the efficiency and reasonable prices.  Cash only! Some other reviews thought the waitress was rude but I found her to just be quiet. Returned my “thank yous” every time with “you’re welcome.” Glad it’s only 10 blocks away!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Very small mom/pop type place. No frills and cash only. However, very popular with the regulars, including me. Love relaxing there, reading newspaper over coffee and delicious won ton soup. Also, enjoy seeing the regulars. Seems especially busy on weekends, but worth the wait for a seat. Breakfast looks delicious!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"I love this place. The food is good, the prices are great, and the staff is friendly. I come here for breakfast often, and they serve a consistently solid breakfast every time. Cash only, so have that on hand. A great local joint in the Richmond district."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Old school coffee shop. Classic American breakfast food, served quickly, at an inexpensive price. No decor to speak of, and is usually busy. Not a good place for a big crowd. But for a local to grab some eggs & hash browns, it's perfect. Cash only!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"This place is a nice diner to have a quick bite and coffee. Don't expect much of an ambiance and its CASH ONLY. You can definitely tell they have some regulars, several people walking out addressed the staff by name. Plus they had bowling on the one TV, so this might be my new regular Sunday breakfast joint."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Maybe it's the neighborhood, but why do these small places always overcook their hash browns? Like burned. Hamburger Haven does it too. I don't want burnt taste consuming my entire meal. They also serve BBQ Pancakes as I call them. Today I got asked if I wanted it ""burned, well or raw"". Seriously? I just ask for it to be made properly. The service is terrible too. I know it's family owned, but there isn't a need to be rude because people have a certain level of expectations. Just be nice. That's all."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Best and cheapest breakfast in the Bay Area, Joes has been around forever and is family run. We have moved away from SF but we STILL talk about their unbeaten hash browns."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"A pretty average omelet & hashbrowns with coffee. The kids' waffles were tasty. Cozy and quaint. No different than a million other diners across the country. Locally owned though, so support 'em!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,Hole-in-the-wall diner that is my go to for a quick and classic American breakfast.  Cheap and cash only. Very comparable to Henry's or Irving Street Cafe on 9th and Irving (in the Sunset).  The elderly folks who run the show add charm and make eating at Joe's worth every visit.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Best waffles in town!  Tiny, 6-table mom & pop coffee shop, with more seating at the counter, serving breakfast and lunch basics.  Try the pork chops & rice, or the chicken and vegetables over rice - nice and garlicky!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"My favorite breakfast place in the world, when I used to live nearby I would go like 2x/week it was amazing."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Very good food, and not expensive at all, and I try to at least go there once a week."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Delicious breakfast at a great price. Small, quaint place that's cozy. Would recommend if you want a good meal to start your day."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Food is basic and tasteless which is expected from an old coffee shop.  What was unacceptable was the rude old lady waitress and I sensed she is the owner.  Small place and wasn't crowded, I flagged her down 3x to take my order and she didn't even give eye contact.  She went on to make coffee for the male customer who sat down and asked for coffee, served him coffee, then put a place setting for him.  Waited some more before she finally came over.  When the food came she practically had the plate in my face, which was rude.  My friends wanted to leave before it got to that point but not many breakfast places around the neighborhood.  I WILL NEVER PATRON THERE AGAIN!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Meh. Was jonesing for pancakes. Joe's may have cured me of my pancake habit. The stock mix they use may have expired. Scrambled eggs were fine and sausage was, well, sausage. Condiments were nameless and of poor quality in sticky bottles. I doubt this critical review will mean much to their seemingly satisfied clientele. Nevertheless, I will find someplace else to breakfast in the future."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Breakfast ok, grilled sandwich passable, do not order dinner. I remember when everything here was made from scratch, sadly, those days are over. I bought two 'piettes' recently that had to have been over a week old...rubbery to the point of being inedible. The veg is canned and absolutely unseasoned, gross!"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"It's exactly what it says it is: a local neighborhood coffee shop. Eggs, bacon, hash browns (the good way – shredded and crisp, not diced 🙂) for very reasonable prices. Pretty good coffee, open early, shuts down after lunch. Bada Bing. The basics. No goofing around with avocadoes or quinoa, no bottomless mimosas, no annoying techies talking loud about IPOs while snapping pics of their food. Only drawback is that it's cash only, and whole the food is decent, there's nothing that sets it apart from any other diner/cafe. And that's just fine."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"My favorite breakfast spot since I was a kid. Low prices for solid food. Don't expect anything fancy or healthy, this is your mom and pop, hole in the wall, no frills restaurant. And for the price...it's worth it."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,Always go out of my way to visit Joe's when im in the city. Its one the special places in the Richmond district that hasnt changed at all in the past 20 years. Tiny diner with a counter and great window seats couple who runs the place remind me of my grandparents. She has the same homey-style of cooking that my grandma did. Always feel at peace and nastalgic here.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"The perfect little diner experience with shockingly affordable prices (compared to the rest of SF). Very solid diner food but don't go in there expecting some farm-to-table, gluten-free nonsense."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"I'd been coming here for years and always enjoyed the food, but they don't take credit cards, and, more important, no matter how polite I was to the wait staff and servers and no matter how well I tipped, I could never elicit a single hello, thank-you, goodbye, or even a smile from either the wife, who co-owns the place and is the primary server, or her daughter, so I stopped coming and took my frequent business to places where it's appreciated. I'm not saying they should roll out the red carpet, but the basic courtesy of a simple thank you would go a long way."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"If you're a refugee from the South looking for a Waffle House, or if you just want a cozy, no frills spot to grab some breakfast, then eat at Joe's. Eggs, toast, omelettes, won ton soup, scallion pancakes; they got you."
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,Amazing hash browns! Great service!
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,No frills here just and old timy dinner feel. Great breakfast. People are nice definitely one of the Richmond district secret diners

Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"Food to eat fast, tasty, but greasy, moreover pancakes were oversalted. Service is pretty much mediocre and indifferent"
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,This is a small family-owned diner. They have good food an exceptional value.
Joe's Coffee Shop,6134 Geary Blvd,"No nonsense greasy spoon.  Avoid during Outsidelands, unless you're going to Outsidelands.  If you ARE going to Outsidelands, maybe you should just stay home instead?"
