Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,If you want a genuinely wonderful coffee experience in SF this is the place to go.  Brad had such a warm energy and welcomes everyone in such an authentic way.  The coffee is so good and I got a bagel sandwich which was yummy too!  The cinnamon snickerdoodle coffee oof.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Castro classic! Best place to unwind after spending time with your dog at the nearby dog park. Excellent coffee, basic pastries, wholesome breakfast egg muffin. I've been going there for over a decade and love the place. They now have a sandwich menu which I'm yet to try. It looks promising. Service is super friendly, and the atmosphere is homey. Great place to bring your laptop and work (though no wi fi provided). And your dog will get a yummy treat."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Nice low-key privately owned place without the corporate atmosphere of a chain.Great selection of coffees and teas and homemade cakes by the owner. BTW if you have a complaint the owner definitely would love to hear about it. They are very proactive on customer's needs
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"My favorite coffee shop in SF - and I get around!  The staff is incredibly friendly and will remember you, and they showcase local artists and causes.  The coffee and tea selection is excellent (House Fancy coffee blend is my favorite) and the prices lower then average in SF.  Most coffee shops have individuals seated and minding their own business. Spike's has a slew of loyal regulars and we enjoy each other's company. A diverse crowd, Spike'd is especially accommodating to the older crowd - people you can learn a thing or two from if you sit and visit.  Even dogs love this place: if you bring your furry buddy before 9am they'll likely get a high quality treat and beg you to come back the next Day.  And the food! A solid selection of baked goods tempts me daily - some of which made fresh by the owners!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"The chi Latte was too spicy, and I've had much better.  Maybe it's just now their specialty. I'd  order something else. Their croissants are good! The place has a small coffee shop feel to it that nice."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"We loved it here! Super friendly staff, delicious coffees. Chilled, welcoming vibe. We stayed for a while and they didn't rush us at all."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"I stopped going to this place.  Somebody recently posted a review about the way they treat mature clients and that validated my experience from a couple of years ago.  It was a rather uncomfortable experience and I wasn't sure if I should share it. I believe that it was the crew that worked at the place at that time and I hope it is different now, although I haven't been back.  Their coffee and tea are good and as I remember it, the place was a perfect spot for quick cuppa and chat.  I normally do not post reviews and I'm willing to go back and check it out."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"This is the best coffee place in the area. Great coffee, quiet, relaxing. The people are nice and kind. They have great cookies too!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Castro neighborhood coffee stop that's been SF locally and independently owned 🌈 Excellent coffee selections, from fresh brew to coffee beans, you name it. To top it off, the friendliness is filled in this place, every time we come in☕🥐🤤😉🤩 …"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Had a really nice time sitting outside with my dog, meeting the locals, and they had a really nice London Fog tea. I look forward to going back!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Staff discriminate agains gay seniors! This coffee shop was a go-to place for me and a bunch of my friends for years.  This was also the place where I bought my coffee beans for home use.  However, during one of my visits, the staff would not let me use the restroom because it was supposedly 'out of order'.  They did not sound convincing, so my companion who is an attractive young gay man went in and asked to use the bathroom and suddenly it was in order. When confronted, the staff found millions of excuses and did not let me use the restroom again because it was 'being serviced' and 'it was all misunderstanding'.  A group of my friends tested the situation three days later. One of my friends, who was also a Spike regular and senior, asked to use the bathroom and received the same answer.  Another friend who is young and attractive was allowed to use it.  Again, when confronted, the staff came up with all sorts of feeble excuses.  We are never going back!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Lovely neighborhood coffee and tea gem. We all had free refills on our tea.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Great coffee shop in the Castro. It's off the main strip on 19th Street, so it's nice to sit outside and have a nice conversation with a friend, or meet someone new to talk to."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Omgahhhh I love Spike's! It's the center of my favorite weekend ritual: wake up, meet the regular crew sitting by the window, sample a new tea, and sit down for a truly nice chat. I have met fascinating folks here. Of all walks of life. The barristas are warm and knowing. The community who gathers here is a ripe delight. Spike's feels like a 2nd home in Castro."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Looking for the real deal around the Castro? Want to sit at a friendly, cozy, authentic café? I tried Spike’s on a Saturday morning. Ordered a medium hot chocolate and a bagel, sat indoors and watched the old guard chat outside. I found the portions generous and the pastries, fresh. Spike’s is a people watcher cafe. It offers an unparalleled view of the 19th and Castro intersection, so if you are a writer or a sketcher, check it out. Clearly a community hub, Spike’s will show you how things used to be, once upon a time..."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Love this place. A short walk from my brothers house. I got coffee by the pound to take home and they had some of my all time favorite kinds Tanzanian Peaberry and Kona too! If your in the Castro you must make St must stop in!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"I became attracted to this space by the over friendly staff and patrons, and enjoyed going every time I was in the neighborhood. Until today. The barista attitude I received did not fit. I wonder if the batista was newly hired from an overpriced millennial cafe? Bad fit, IMO. There's three other Castro coffee houses... I'll definitely defer to one of them in the future, as in, tomorrow."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Some of the best chai!  I got the mix of the unsweetened house chai and the sweetened chai and it was really good. It was slightly sweet and had a lot of flavor. This place is also vegan friendly!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Spike’s coffee is my current favorite coffee place in SF, and they have mysteries, the sense of quiet  intrigue , that makes the coffee taste even better.  plus they actually sell coffee as a thing, not as an experience which I find admirable"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Not my favorite americano but the pastries are good. The place is cozy and cute, the staff is welcoming and friendly."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Great black tea selection.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Extensive selection of coffees and teas and more flavored syrups than I knew existed!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,I love Spike's. Grab a mug for purchase on your way out so you never forget your delicious cappucino experience while at home. Great energy!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Great coffee and treats in an adorable little old-school feeling cafe. So cozy, and the baristas are friendly and chill as well."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Good place. Drip is good when fresh. But lattes are hit or miss depending on who does them. Last one I had was burnt and far from tasty.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Everyone here is so darling! I love coming here to get my coffee, the staff are always happy and helpful. The coffee is also VERY good. I love their house decaf, and today I tried their Ethiopian and loved it too. I don't buy my coffee anywhere else. I never had an actual coffee here, I just buy coffee for home. But they have a nice crowd every morning (at least they used to before covid came to make our lifes a little worse)."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Was visiting San Francisco for the first time and got recommended this place by a friend. Amazing coffee, lovely atmosphere and delightful staff"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,The perfect place to start your day in the beautiful Castro District of SF. The employees are very cheerful & helpful and I really enjoyed my veggie bagel sandwich and almond milk chai - super delicious!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"This is your quintessential neighborhood coffee shop. Everyone here is incredibly friendly and warm. It's like Cheers (where everybody knows your name).  Once I brought in a ceramic tumbler to grab coffee before work, and they swished around hot water in it to warm it up for me. You can always count on a smile here and a friendly face. And someone going the extra mile to make you feel like family."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Decent iced latte, they did light ice as I requested, but the coffee was almost sour, and not in a good way. It was fine and it grew on me, but not my favorite. The staff were a bit snarky, not overtly but there were undertones of snark, but they were fine. The chocolate croissant was also fine. They asked if I wanted it warmed up, and that was a decent suggestion. There was a steady line but nothing crazy, and my wait was about 5-7 minutes total from entering to having my wares. Average prices—medium iced latte and the croissant for $7.25 plus tip. They use compostable cups and straws; e straws are paper but they hold up for a bit. There’s not much seating if that’s your jam—2 or 3 tables outside, 2 in the window inside, and another 4 or so small tables across from the counter inside. Conveniently located near the heart of the Castro, but a block or two away."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"I love Spike's! The coffees and teas are great (not the absolute best in SF, but very good). But the real reasons I love this neighborhood joint are the staff, who are absolutely lovely, and the atmosphere. My favorite late morning activity is to order a large steaming mug of chai tea and curl up with a book. The interior is small, but you can almost always find a seat. They have outdoor seating which unfortunately is in the shade and always a bit chilly, but great for those who congregate with their dogs. As the name and logo implies, it's dog friendly and people friendly too!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Although I never tried the pastries there, I overheard people saying they were very good! Plus, the staff are amazingly nice and always down for a quick chat (given the amount of customers behind you in the queue) and/or a piece of advice. The coffee is goo and they have a great selection of different coffee and tea to drink locally or bring back home. The price is average, but the location is very nice so it's actually really worth it"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Cold brew was good, if a bit oversteeped. The atmosphere is cute, and I appreciate the commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices. They have a lot of varieties of bulk coffee that I would have tried if I were in town longer. I don't know if it's standard in SF, but I don't think they have a restroom, which seemed weird for a coffee shop. I'd go here for coffee again but not to sit down and study or work."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Friendly neighborhood coffee shop, consistently good good coffee. You'll see the same crowd of locals, and local dogs, sitting out front every morning. Also popular with with parents and kids from Harvey Milk school, which can sometimes create a rush before 9:30."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Absolutely love this place! Service, atmosphere and drinks were amazing! Came for coffee and chai and left two hours later. Stumbled upon a gem in the city. While this may seem like basics to those reading it, I’ve noticed service isn’t exactly consistent in the Bay Area."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Wonderful neighborhood coffee shop. All the baristas are nice, talented, and kind. If you go on weekends, neighbors will hold your dog for you outside while you go inside to order. A lovely place!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Just had a quick stop here, but the coffee and croissants were great! Good fuel for the next leg of my road trip, would visit again!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"If you like a smooth not too sweet mocha this place is perfect. Also the affogatto I may have misspelled that (espresso over ice cream) is addictive, so proceed with caution. Definitely coming here daily if not twice daily while I'm in CA!!!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Reasonably priced wide selection of coffee beans (try house blend or Lauren's blend). I also like the blue eyes iced tea drink (or I buy loose tea to go).  I like their cappuccinos too although it depends which barista you get.  Recently used spikes to cater a party with a big container of coffee of house blend and it was great.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Spike’s is awesome!!! Nice staff too! Love the old style look too!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,This is a fantastic coffee shop a ideal place to enjoy a hot joe and chill. You can sit outside in the afternoon and listen to mating calls of the brightly feathered gay birds as they flutter to there watering holes or converse with the friendly 4 legged locals and there 2 legged companions . The baristas are skilled and friendly and truly pay homage to that wonderful Ethiopian boy and his goat who found that delightful bush in the mists of time. So if you  want coffee and silence go to Starbucks but if you want to experience coffee and enjoy life and coffee made with flair and care go to Spikes .
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Great Castro neighborhood standard with super friendly and helpful staff. Always a treat to sit outside on a sunny day. A variety of different iced teas to choose from.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Excellent neighborhood coffee place. Great service and good prices. Good pastries also.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Fun staff - they sing really well. The tea is good - better than every other place in the Castro. I don't know about the coffee, but I bet it's good, too. Seating is nice."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Great service! My english is not very good and they used Google translate or an app. They did exactly what I wanted. That was the best coffee I've tried in San Francisco! The atmosphere inside is very nice with friendly people.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Absolutely delicious! And the staff is so sweet to every customer that comes in 💞💞  Try the spinach and feta croissant c:
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Friendly people. Definitely a good house made chai (spicy).
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Super friendly and welcoming environment. Love the concept of choosing from their amazing variety of coffee beans and vast original teas.  Simple self serve and pay. Staff is very cordial and knowledgeable.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Nice friendly place. Very Good Chai latte and they offer a spicy and/or sweet chai. Love the tiles! Kid friendly - lots of families came by and they sell some candy they like.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Spike's always has great music and the coffee is really dark and rich. It also has that village feel with people sitting outside. I always get a chocolate crossant with my coffee - the breakfast bars are really good to.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Those sassy baristas and organic beans make Spikes my go-to coffee hotspot. It's not even near my house but I make the trek for the best brewed coffee in the city. If you're feeling like a treat-yo-self moment, I'd recommend an almond soy latte. Divine."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Really warm neighborhood vibe, solid coffee, truly amazingly nice staff, but the lady making bagels behind the counter was obviously sick and shouldn't be handling customer food. So close to perfect!"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"I do not only recommend this gem for its coffee ☕ and tea 🍵but also for the lovely style, reasonable prices and great outside seating. And all in the very center of the Castro district. Awesome! …"
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Just like restaurants in the bay area there are as many or more coffee shops. This one offers an old town feel. With burlap coffee sacks from all over the world hanging from the cealing and the stocked coffee beans in a brilliant shabby sheek display case. This small shop has a limited menu making the ordering process easy.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Great little coffee spot, perfect for afternoon iced coffee and pet friendly outdoor seating."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,Cozy cute San Fran Coffee Shop. Nice staff and very good coffee. Yummy pastries. The cheesecake pumpkin muffin was sooo good. New York crumbled cake mmmh. There're only a few chairs and 2 small tables inside. But also outside seating!
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"Super friendly people, great neighborhood vibe. Tasty coffee. And in response to the person who said there's no restroom, you just have to ask nicely and they'll let you use it."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"One of my favorite local spots. The coffee and  is pretty good, but the main value point is the super friendly staff, and the cute dogs the customers have."
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,If you're looking for the authentic coffee shop in the Castro you find it at spikes. No one's been there longer serving coffee I meant being a friendly part of the neighborhood.
Spike's Coffees and Teas,4117 19th St,"This is a traditional small shop selling a large range of roasted coffee beans. Perhaps their drip is solid, but I had a mediocre cappuccino. It tasted overly bitter and with uneven, hot froth."
