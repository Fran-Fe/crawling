Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Tried multiple items in the past and everything is superb!! From the banh mi to the wooly pig. Fresh ingredients and everything is flavorful. Love the unique side options of shrimp chips or sweet potato fries.  Definitely a must try if you’re in the area.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Got the grilled pork Bahn Mi. Super super good. The staff was really nice too. Let me get a sample of the Vietnamese coffee before deciding. Great little place
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Everything here is always good, but the Curry Udon with Pork and Szechuan Fish was absolutely incredible. Well crafted dishes, good portions, good presentation, good vibes. The ginger chicken Jook also is great comfort food if you have a cold."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Had an awesome lunch with my dad, we shared the Chinese Chicken salad and the Ginger Chicken Jook. It was perfect for a rainy day. I want to come back and try more of the menu + their cafe/drink options!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"After picking up pastries from Neighbor BakeHouse, I needed a fantastic cappuccino. The Wooly Pig delivered a really tasty drink. The Wooly Pig was clean, pretty, had great music with a chill vibe. I loved it!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Must grab lunch at this Dogpatch gem! The Bahn Mi is SO good (every variety from classic to vegetarian to fried chicken). The bagel sandwich and breakfast sandwich is delicious, too (served to 11 am). Don't skip the coffee! While not a dedicated coffee shop, they serve some of the best I've had in SF. Love the oat milk lattes and the mocha. All the staff at Wooly Pig are great and the owner is a stand-up guy. Support this business!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Such a good Bahn Mi! Made on proper crusty French bread with deli meats and pate. Sublime. Wish I lived closer so I could eat it all the time! Love that they also sell other delicious Asian treats such as salted egg lays chips, sake, kimchi, condiments and drinks."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Curry udon with fried chicken was amazing and surprisingly good. The soup is very flavorful, has nice greens, chicken is tender and well-seasoned, udon is very authentic. Will definitely come back again.  Good bagels too!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Fantastic experience! Great food, quick and easy service and fresh ingredients. I appreciated the vegetarian options and good portion sizes as well."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Great environment with friendly customer services but prices are bit at higher end for sandwiches. My friend ordered the tri tip steak vietnamese sandwich, bit dry & tough. I had pull pork sandwich which was flavorful with lots of meat except the hot cheetos inside the sandwich. Shrimp chips were crunchy & tasty. Overall, not my favorite sandwich place. With the price of $12 - 15 per sandwich, I expect more."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"I'm afraid to tell you how good this place is because I don't want there to be a huge line like everywhere else in this neighborhood, but this place is awesome. I had the Sumee's bagel (bacon, tomato, pickled jalapeno, sauteed onions, and hummus [or cream cheese]) and it was delicious. A little pricey, but what isn't in SF these days. Definitely coming back for their lunch fare, but if you are a late-riser, its good to know breakfast is served all day."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Wonderful fried chicken sandwich! Such a chic interior and great lunch spot in Dogpatch 🥪
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"First off the staff is wonderful, good people good eats. The sandwiches are not your typical Bonmi sandwiches, or typical sandwiches in general. These are very special and made with love kind of sandwiches. Coffee is great, and to top it off that there shrimp chips are to die for!! In the picture bellow that is the Wooly pig is soft and tender Pulled pork, but my go to is the bonmi cold cut. Very clean place , I never walked in disappointed or left disappointed."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"This place is sooooo[5 os] good!  Staff is friendly.  Everything I’ve tried had been phenomenal.  Chicken sammie, sweet potatoe fries, & coconut udon 🔥  Even ordered delivery and it was hot and superb.  Not everyone can achieve that!  Do yourself a favor and go here!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Good Bahn Mi sandwich, salad, and sweet potato fries, the sweet chili sauce on the sandwich was a bit unnecessary, and their was no daikon but the tofu and fresh herbs were tasty."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,2-14-21: Ordered two bahn mi sandwiches to go. One was the tofu and the other was the grilled pork.  Both were delicious. Would definitely come back again for more goodies.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Super solid little corner shop in Dogpatch!  Good: - They have a lot of outdoor seating that's covered and super cute to sit at - Loved their asian Cubano - super tasty and good portion size - I ended up taking one half of it home - Loved the chai latte - about as sweet as a Starbucks drink so not sure how healthy it is for you haha  Bad: - More casual spot and some of the tables can be a bit dirty/not cleaned between patrons - Slower service -they were quite busy on a Sunday afternoon  Overall really enjoyed this cute spot near my place in Dogpatch and would come back to try some of the other things on their menu.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"I came by to grab lunch with a friend. We got a pork bahn mi and curry udon noodle bowl. The pork bahn mi was good and filling, though the pickled carrots could have been more tarte. The udon noodle bowl needed more flavor and wasn’t anything to rave about."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Fusion done right. Vietnamese-styled sandwiches but with some western twists. Justin's Roast Beef has just the right amount of jalapeno kick. The Wooly Pig has great caramelization. Great chai panacotta. The place is open, airy, and relaxed. Serves Andytown coffee. Parking is nearly impossible during weekdays."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Staffs are friendly. We got the banmi and curry udon. Banmi was just average but the curry udon was kind of thai style, very delicious."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Awesome spot for all things sandwich!Soup and salads are tasty as well. ❤️curry udon soup 👎lemonades/teas and coffee are bland …
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,It is like a 4.5 for me  Ordered Wooly burger. It tastes fusion - kind of like pulled pork burger with an Asian twist to it. It's sweet and savory. It's a fair value as well given the amount of food. It comes with a side.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Used to eat here all the time when it was in the inner sunset. Glad to see they've changed up their menu a little bit. Love their pulled pork sandwich!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Sooo good. My wife and I come here once a week to get sandwiches (for lunch or brunch). A great, hip, friendly local spot. So many twist on Vietnamese bahn mi from vegan, to steak, and original. Many other selection like soup and egg sammys. Love this place. So glad to get it in the hood!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Tried the tofu banh mi and it did not disappoint. The only disappointment I had was not trying out this place sooner. Quality asian drinks, snacks and food."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Great place for a quick lunch. The burger has some great flavors, and the Szechuan chicken is pretty sweet and sour with nicely cooked rice. I like the counter service, and they also offer nice coffees, including cold brew."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Had the  dinner special (boneless pork chops over rice) and it was everything I hoped for. Crispy but still tender, good portions, seasoned perfectly."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"The only, the best, the surprise asian food store in Dogpatch! So many hidden gems here. Check out their home-flavored porridges."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Flavorful, juicy pork belly sandwich. The biroche bun was the perfect softness too. Yummy--highly recommend!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Udon with curry fried chicken and breakfast sandwich. Missing this places since it moved out of the Sunset. Good food and service.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Cute cafe with great Asian fusion sandwiches. Also, amazing service!!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Wooly Pig honestly has really good, high quality Vietnamese food. I usually get the traditional cold cut banh mi with the Vietnamese ham + paté and the quality of ingredients + size of the sandwich is great. The vermicelli bowl with pork + egg rolls is also great. A little pricy but to be expected for location."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Pros: Nice Thai iced tea and Chinese Tofu salad. Cons: Negligible options for vegetarians in the dinner menu. I found the Almond panna cotta to be a bit weird tasting but a Chinese friend of mine really liked it since it reminded her of her childhood desserts. Overall decent food experience
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,The ginger chicken jook was surprisingly good. Definitely getting that again when i have a sore throat.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"My girlfriend and I went to have lunch two weeks ago and were pleasantly surprised by the food. In a town where finding tasty food is becoming a challenge, we enjoyed every bite of it. Flavors  and freshness of ingredients made our lunch remarquable. Thank you to everyone at Wooly Pig to gave us such a great experience."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Wooly Pig is our house's go-to lunch spot. Every sandwich I've gotten is spectacular, and I'd order all of them again in a heartbeat. So tasty! Their brioche is fluffy and perfect for capturing all the sandwich flavors. I want to find out where they get their shrimp chips so that I can order them in bulk. Highly recommend it!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Really good thai tea and sandwiches here. You don’t want to miss thai tea🧡🧡🧡 …
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Demolishing this Tasty Fried chicken sandwich from Wooly Pig!! Friendly and Courteous staff. A Great Lunch! Thank you Wooly Pig!!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Probably my favorite spot in SF. I've ordered here countless times, they simply do not miss!!! Plus their veggie options! Highly recommend the veggie banh mi. Perfect amount of sauce"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Cute little sandwich spot with a small Asian grocery. A little upset that while I asked for my Banh Mi without any jalapeno, it was still spicy. Sweet potato fries were good though."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,The fish or chicken burrito is ridiculously good. I prefer shrimp chips to tortilla chips. Lots of cool drink options. Great to take out and eat at Crane Cove Park.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Their mochas are extremely tasty! Good amount of sweetness and earthy bitterness. The overall ambience of the place isn't too bad. Most of the time it's quite clean and well-organized. Their pastries are tasty as well. Haven't had a miss yet. Their signature dish, the Wooly Pig, is easily the best item on the menu. Lots of good complexity and an even mixing of tangy flavors and served warm, which is always good on an SF morning. The rest of their menu can be a bit heavy on heat, which tends to push out all the other flavors in a sandwich. Otherwise, would recommend!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Excellent variety of quality sandwiches. Tri tip Banh mi and WP sandwiches recommended.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,The place had a cool chill atmosphere plus the sandwiches there are pretty damn tasty. 💕
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"I miss their joke board. The owner has the best sense of humor, only rivalled by his menu's creativity."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,The Wooly Pig is one of the best pulled pork sandwiches in the land.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Great environment. Amazing food. I had the breakfast sandwich with avocado and bacon. The presentation was awesome and the taste even better. Their fresh lemonade is also an added bonus. Fair pricing. Would definitely recommend!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"My local for lunch or dinner. Awesome food with an eclectic variety and an Asian twist. Love the Udon, Banh Mi and the chicken sandwiches. I go here at least four times a week."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Really really good. Get the pulled pork ""wooly pig sandwich""."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"This is a great lunch spot that doesn't break your budget.  I feel it is more of a sandwich spot, but they have plate choices.   The food feels Asian influenced, but with a few non-Asian dishes.  Overall I recommend this place."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Our entire family went here today, and we had the absolute greatest experience!  The breakfast sandwich was incredible and the morning bun was wonderful!  That's not what made the experience great though!  While we were waiting for our food, a homeless mad came in and sat at our table, he started asking for money and food.  The owner immediately came over and offered him coffee and something to eat so that he would stop asking for things from us.  The man than three a bunch of trash on the ground and started spitting on the ground, but the owner was so kind and compassionate towards the man, offered to reseat us and never treated the man like he wasn't a human.  I really loved how this was handled.  The owner of this restaurant is a good person and the food is amazing.  This place deserves your business."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Curry udon: no flavor Asian Cuban sandwich: overpowered mustard flavor. Very disappointed Atmosphere: dirty floor, trash"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"If you liked the original on Hugo St, you will LOVE this place!  The owners are able to showcase their culinary creativity now that they have a real restaurant kitchen to work with.  Menu changes once a month to keep things fresh and novel.  I enjoyed visiting and look forward to future visits to try new menu items"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"This review is for the curry udon only - The broth is freakishly amazing - it is so tasty, bursting w flavor and unique! I’d like to try the bahn mi sando but I think it’s quite overpriced so I won’t ;(("
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,The best blueberry Danish I've had in a long time. Food menu was impressive even for a soft opening. Friendly and helpful staff. All around great experience. I will definitely be back for their Grand opening on Monday!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Best sandwiches in Dogpatch! I really liked the Asian cubano, but the real star is the eggplant.  It's a real treat!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"The sandwiches are extremely good. I've had the Wooly Pig and the Andrew, and both were amazing. But what really sticks out is the staff is extremely friendly and nice. Their service alone makes me what to come often."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,I love this place.  Everyone is super nice.  Everything is tasty.  The curry udon is my favorite after a late night out.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Had an early lunch while we were working in the area.  I had the Laab Burger.  I'm normally a regular Burger guy but this was aromatic and fresh.  Liked the Kaffir lime , have it a great flavor.  Also got the sweet potato fries, good but I and my two lunch companions couldn't finish them."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,We love the bahn mi & congee / jook. The small grocery area with pantry staples has saved us a few times. Neighborhood gem.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Easily, the best sandwiches in sf. I loved having you guys in the hood over on Hugo St (especially the holiday block party!), but I'm more than willing to make the cross-city trek to sample the new and expanded fare. Continued success!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Tried their ban mi sandwich with sweet potato fries for an extra dollar as a side upgrade. Ban mi tasted authentic like the ones I had in Vietnam but with a much larger portion of ingredients.  The pate was flavorful but not overpowering. Sweet potato fries were seasoned well and were pretty good. Finished my fries in 5 min. Sandwich along with the side is a large portion so go there hungry.  Other sides you can get with the sandwich include shrimp chips(similar to keropok that you find in South East asia, but more bland. You might find better ones at an Asian market.) Or salad."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Their signature Wooly Pig sandwich is so sweet that it feels like you are eating candy with a meat texture; it is really bad. Banh Mi was quite good. Overall, Banh Mi was not enough to offset horrible experience with Wooly Pig sandwich."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Best place in the Dogpatch to get Asian/ Asian fusion food. Also great place for your standard American breakfast. Have been doing a lot of takeout from here during COVID. Their rice bowls, chicken bahn-mi, chicken salad, and breakfast sandwich are all great"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Nice place for breakfast/lunch. The curry w/ chicken was nice!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Yo first time in San Francisco this place is amazing every time. Be patient with your order and the experience will be awsome. Food is on point service is also friendly and excellent! Highly recommend!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Had the tuna sandwich, which was outrageously good with a lovely hit of lime served on some great bread. However, I was so jealous of the pork sandwiches being served I couldn't help but feel like I made the wrong choice, definitely gotta go back."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Friendly staff, no line, plenty of healthy menu options, plus warm and stylish decor. Totally loveable place 🥰"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Cool Asian fusion on sandwiches (banh mí, Thai and Cubana inspired). Also great value as sandwiches are huge!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Good food and location, friendly service."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"You’re gonna want to come here and get the Wooly Pig sandwich. Braised and shredded pork belly, spiked with Shanghainese spices, served generously on a soft brioche. Savory, sweet, and more juicy than it has any right to be, do yourself a solid and pick one up. If there’s space left in your tank, skip the side salad and order the sweet potato fries. Ketchup is available, but the curry aioli that accompanies it is a far better pairing. Brewed coffee was aight."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Kool place and nice staff also love the menu!
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Amazing food, super fast"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,The Sumee bagel sandwich was amazing!!  Bacon for days with a little extra kick to it. This place has a great vibe and really friendly and attentive staff.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"We come here on the regular. Fantastic sandwiches, friendly and quick service, nice ambiance, it’s our go-to lunch and brunch spot in the neighborhood. We love Wooly!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Tasty food.  Good selection.  Large portions.  Fair prices.  Friendly staff.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Wooly pig food has impressed me so far and I’m a hard person to please. They also have amazing customer service, I stepped out of the store momentarily and the amazing cashier Becky ran out just to personally give me food. This place is a must try if you’re in the Dogpatch area."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"When I lived in the sunset, I never went to their old location but I’m glad I just discovered it. All their banh mis are fantastic! Honestly, you can’t go wrong!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"wooly pig is, hands down, the best cafe in the city. the new space is amazing, the food (breakfast sando and udon soup ESPECIALLY, but everything) is delicious, and Lieng and everyone else there are the friendliest.  go. you won't be disappointed."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"This place has excellent asian and Asian fusion foods, nice mix of different cultures. Try the wings, beef stew or taiwanese pork chop."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,One of the best Bahn Mi I’ve had in the city! Great selection of asian specialty food items too.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Great food and incredibly friendly, fast service. Came for a late lunch on a Friday and ordered a pork banh mi on a whim. Delicious!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Omg! So good! Catered an office lunch and I will definitely be eating the food again.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Delicious food. I will definitely be back. The eggplant panini and sweet potato fries were 👌🏼
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Super tasty pulled pork sandwich. Big enough to split between friends with an added side. Natural sunlight creates a warm friendly space.

Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"Great staff, owner is awesome.  And the curry soup is to die for. Cause if u dont know now u know... Yummmy for my tummy Thanks Woolie pig!"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"The food in this place is ok, but it takes a ridiculous amount of time to get it. Plus the customer service is not good at all."
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,"food was good, but there is no restroom available for customers. UNACCEPTABLE! I won't be back"
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Our COVID staple food place. “What do you want for lunch?” Wooly Pig. “What do you want for dinner?” Wooly Pig. The Banh Mi and Beef Stew are bomb.
Wooly Pig,2295 3rd St,Delicious sandwichws (try the one with crab salad) and super friendly staff. This was my second visit and I'll be back again soon!
