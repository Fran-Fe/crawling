Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This place should be protected at all costs. Got the bagel with cream cheese and avocado with all the fixins (sprouts, onions, tomatoes, and small serving of fruit) for $7.25, and a large mocha for $4.50.  Zahrah, the shop owner, was sweet and super genuine. Cafe International is an institution, supported by locals and keeping prices affordable despite being in the Lower Haight. Cash only with atm on site. This place is amazing (shop local!)"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Decided to stop here because we passed by every morning. Had the bagel with lox, my friend had the bagel with egg. It was okay — not great. Wasn’t super fresh or tasty. Gave me a TON of coffee which was also meh. It looks cute but I wouldn’t stop in."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"The owner was out and three guys were running the cafe.  I normally love going there, but they were really slacking today.  The guy who made my sandwich was not wearing gloves and one of the guys was eating behind the counter (not super horrible, but it's a very bad look).  When I got home I found a hair in my sandwich.  I'll keep going there for my coffe, but I think my orderig food days there are over."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This place is an amazing hidden gem in Lower Haight, with the most relaxing backpatio! They have great coffee and a wide ranges of options for breakfast or lunch. It's my favorite local coffee in the neighborhood. I love the international feel, the welcoming and laid back owner who speaks many languages! Make sure to drop by there if you're around."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I liked it a lot - it’s just a great space! Delicious house roast coffee!!! I got the bagel and hummus and they were perfect with little piles of veggies on the side. Reasonable prices, lovely and friendly service, and cozy seating and decor."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This cafe was here b4 me, and I've been here 35 years. Such a great local place, and live jazz on Sundays. So great, you have to stop in."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This place is an absolute gem!!! I came here for breakfast, super cool inside, good vibe all around. The lady at the register was super nice and funny! The avocado bagel I got was fabulous! House coffee was good. And everything was so reasonably price. This is a really good place to come and chill or work on your computer since there is also free WiFi. There is also a super cute backyard area with lots of plants and a beautiful mural. You can smoke in the backyard as well. Definitely recommend and definitely coming back!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Went to check out this place on a Sunday and it was great! They had live music, a great atmosphere and lots of seating! Food was priced well and taste decent. Will definitely be coming back!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Really groovy coffee shop! Lots of tables and also some super comfy sofas. Came in for a coffee 2go but stuck around because there was a local blues band playing awesome tunes inside!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"The best place - wonderful, funky, an institution. Zahra is a mini sf celebrity, so sweet and funny and speaks like 14 languages. Food menu is much better than it looks."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"So I heard about this place from my employer. It's warm and inviting inside. Very spaceous, your able to find your own little spot of personal space. People converse with strangers others are sketching in notebooks, most stop in as their morning routine. The preprioter is warm friendly and inviting person. The menu is simple, with pastries and bagel sandwiches. Coffee or espresso drinks can be found here as well. Although the prices are more than reasonable for the city of rising cost. It is cash only. A ATM exist. That has a small fee if you need to get cash. I ordered a everything bagel with hummus and capers, and she didn't even charge me for the capers. In fact the veggies come free on every sandwich, also included is a small fruit cup. About the size of most to go condiments cups. Nice touches and excellent price compared to chain like Noah's, where it's be over 10 dollars for something similar."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,2 sandwiches $22.  Very unsatisying.  Over-priced.  Why so few chips?   Sandwich was all bread - no meat.  Also got an over priced crumb cake $5. Not fresh.  Also the only coffee shop I go to where my Internet has problems connecting.  The two stars are for the space and the staff unless they are the owners who are overcharging for their food.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"My first cafe experience in SF over a decade ago and still the best cafe in the city! Peaceful back patio with colorful tables, super friendly staff, good music, and strong iced coffee."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Yelp and Google reviewers gave 4.5 stars for this place. I was a little disappointed. The almond milk Cafe latte was mediocre. I wanted it “extra extra hot”, it came tepid. The almond milk was too thin so it was like drinking weakly brewed coffee. My son ordered Turkish coffee and it came very sweet.  However he later said he could get used to it. Two things that were redeeming: 1. The staff was very friendly and sweet; 2. The back patio with painted frescoes was cute and nice place to sit."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Outstanding in so many ways  Affordable - Cash only, but you know when a place is great it’s cash only and still people streams into.  $3.75 for mocha  Character -  Unapologetic in expressing they’re left-wing and anti-privilege.  So abundantly liberal it spills into their bathroom.  They probably forgot the Rastafarian mural and just put a mop in front of it.  Top it off… - Excellent deck garden - Murals and wall plants in the back - Live jazz music every weekend"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Very cool spot! Comfy chairs and a bright staff. The coffee wasn't great but the atomsophere more than made up for it.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I met the sweetest, kindest woman working the register this morning. Her name is Zalah and she is the owner. Tasty breakfast sandwich and great coffee. I have found a new place for coffee when I'm in SF! #TenStars"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,The latte was amazing and the person at the front was so welcoming and personable. Seems like the kind of place where the owner knows everyone's name
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I have been living in the neighborhood for over a year and pass by this place often. This morning I absolutely needed a bagel and a smoothie, and they sure delivered on that. Cozy interior with plenty of seating, including a sunny outdoor patio in the back. They have draft beer on tap as well (lagunitas my fav <3)  The very sweet lady at the register took care of me, and the man preparing the food/drinks was also very kind. Bagel was perfect, and the smoothie (#1 on the menu) was fresh and delicious.  10/10 would recommend and I see myself frequenting this place from now on."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Great music spot for local artists. Live music on Sundays starting around 5 until close. They serve beer, wine, and coffee. The food is decent too."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,It is a good place to go. Purely my opinion. Food is reasonably price. Yum yum . I love my friends
Cafe International,508 Haight St,I used to call this place my backyard. I would go down for my morning tea sit in the backyard chat with the locals and with the Amazing owner Zahra when she had a second she's a busy woman after all. It's a San Francisco classic. Go Enjoy.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,This seems to be the only place I found in San Francisco where you can smoke in the garden. They also seem to have a sense of humor. Coffee isn’t the best but I guess it depends what you’re looking for. Friendly staff.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This place is a total gem! If you live or are visiting Lower Haight, soak up the unique, zany, and distinctively San Franciscan vibe and energy you'll receive from both the atmosphere and owner (Zara) of this wonderful establishment.  Pro tip: GREAT COFFEE, they don't skimp on it either, their ice coffees are served with ice cubes made of MORE coffee, it's like getting a double size but paying for a normal size  Pro tip #2: Get the pastrami sandwich on Dutch crunch, it's delicious, great ingredients and juicy good cuts of meet, generous portions  Pro tip #3: BEST FRESHLY SQUEEZED GRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGE JUICE YOU CAN GET IN THE CITY. I get one of these every time and it's amazing  Pro tip #4: Bring cash"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Food is average, the jazz/vibe is better!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"As a spoken word artist, Soul Brotha #9, I felt a bit less welcomed in the beginning by the band leader. I wish he could have prepared me for the stage or the stage for me. I'll be back because the applause was fantastic."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I just love this spot. Fresh squeezed on, and other juices. Wonderful, big sandwiches,  great soup, back patio with a gorgeous mural. I love the owner ,zahra...best place for a stiff coffee. If you want it iced, she makes coffee ice cubes. My mom visits from Wisconsin,  those to are great friends ,as am i, since 1994."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"We've fallen in love with this place. Great neighborhood coffee shop. Unpretentious, lots of space, outdoor smoke-friendly area, good music, community vibe. Owners are awesome too."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,I miss my morning coffee runs to Cafe International and chatting it up with Zahra (owner). Iced Coffee is the best with the coffee ice cubes. Truly my favorite spot for coffee and breakfast fare in the city!  Whenever I'm in the Lower Haight I make a point to stop by.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Nice place. Good selection of tea and pastries. Chill atmosphere. Live music was nice.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Cool place! Nice interior, great pastry and huge cups of coffee. Had a full band playing live in the store at 1pm!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Great atmosphere, wonderful live music, good food! They made us feel like we were regulars right away. Will definitely be coming back! Thank you <3"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Friendly staff and good life music. Perfect to chill
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco for getting work done. Lots of space indoors and outdoors, comfy chairs with wide tables, a fun aesthetic, good power outlets, good Wi-Fi, a bunch of different salads and sandwiches on the menu (freshly made to order), Turkish coffee, a graffitied but always clean bathroom, no time limit."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Coffee is strong, it's large and quiet (at least on a Sunday morning) and there's a nice back patio. If you're allergic to tobacco smoke the patio  may not be the place for you. The owner is very friendly, welcoming, and outgoing.  I understand there's music in the evenings."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"4.5⭐️ Cozy sofas, eclectic crowd and flippant/fun staff. Only the latte was a little weak."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Great place to have soup and listen to live music. Wish it were open later! So cozy
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I never see a place with 100 on their health inspection score!! The owner is hilarious and very nice, the staff is sweet and caring, and the food as GREAT! Nice place to chill or have a drink. When it's not busy, it's also nice to work at. Definitely for playful attitude. (Cash Only though)"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Very friendly service.  Cash only but there’s an ATM machine inside Big tables, comfortable chairs, WiFi and power sockets against the wall."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"For once I found a place that isn't pretentious and is 'what you see is what you get'.  The food is decent and relatively cheap compared to other places, the coffee is decent, but the atmosphere is what I like the most.  It's worn in, wabi-sabi, graffiti style art on the wall, cool couches, hardwood floors, just a cool and unique place.  There are open mic nights which bring interesting characters and stays open late. The people that go are amazing and are very welcoming to new people. I never felt so at home in SF.  Thanks for the good times and the hospitality."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Best Turkish Coffee and bagels in the city.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,The place is good enough but I couldn't get why the reviews seem excited about it. Basic neighborhood coffee shop.  Most of the furniture looks like goodwill - not that that's a bad thing.  Plus is the artwork was pretty cool but nothing extremely exciting.  I did like the murals in the men's room. I thought the deserts were a little on the pricey side but nothing out of line.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This place is a dying breed when it comes to classic hang out spots in the Lower Haight. Friendly and authentic staff, good strong coffee, chill music. I come here to study/work as well as to grab a quick bite, and it's great for both purposes. Check out the cool mural in the back patio."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This is a really unique place that has been in this neighborhood for decades. The food isn’t particularly good—nor are the drinks. But this place more than makes up for it with neighborhood hospitality and cool events: they have an open mic night and frequently have live music. There’s also free WiFi, and a dog friendly back patio area. This place helped me decide to move to Lower Haight, and I’m glad I did."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Excellent tuna melt!  Very friendly staff and live Jazz! Will come back!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Love this place, it is an absolute institution and Zara always makes me feel welcome whenever I swoop in for a smoothie! Try the Max's special if you are going for breakfast and don't forget to bring cash!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Still Wonderful place with Great food and live music on the weekends at this lovely SF place. All Honor Zarah!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"The best Cafe' Shop I've been to, since I started riding a bicycle from Alabama to San Francisco. I've been ""hanging out"" here every day for the last week, and doing my best to support a ""locally owned"" small business.  The owner is an amazing individual who has a passion for sharing her culture with energy and enthusiasm. I've been to many, many coffee shops through my ride across the country, and none of them come close to this one.  Go Support Them! :)"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Really great coffee shop that has San Francisco written all over it. The espresso and drinks are really great and are fairly reasonably priced as well. The atmosphere is what really makes this place great though, it's always happening in here whether there's an open mic or jazz or whatever they want that night. You could be in here for hours and not even realize it. A great, classic San Francisco coffee shop for the Lower Haight."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This cafe has been my second home for over 5 years and I can't recommend it enough for its delicious egg/bagel breakfast, iced coffee, coffee cake and amazing people. If you're in San Francisco, it's worth traveling to because you'll leave full of love and tasty food."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Great Coffee Shop if you ever find yourself on lower Haight Street. Staff and customers are very friendly. They have good coffee, lentil soup & mediterrian. I have been coming here for almost 20 years and recommend this place if you want an authentic San Francisco coffee-shop experience."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Fun, nice person made us feel right at home. Took our orders and even made me an iced green tea special. Good tunes on the speaker, calm vibe. Diverse group of customers. Love it here (who doesnt?!)"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Funky and cool ""divey"" coffee house that has a limited menu (hot and cold sandwiches and soup)... They also have live events a few times per week (Jazz, open mic, etc.) There's also a nice secluded outdoor patio that is never all that crowded. My only complaint is that the coffee merely OK. It's not ""Blue Bottle"" or ""Stanza"" quality at all. Drinkable, yes! But there is much better coffee to be had in SF."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Absolutely wonderful - be aware it is cash only!!!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Very nice place. Ate a roast pork sandwich that was delicious. The pea soup with bread you have to try. Excellent place. Thx so much.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Good vibes, live music on Saturday afternoon was a nice surprise"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,The friendly atmosphere and the feeling that you are walking into your safe space. I love the people the coffee and the relaxation I get before my work day.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Looked very chilled & relaxed till we were served. The lady behind the counter was so rude & obnoxious. Poor, poor customer service. One customer asked about what was on the Middle Eastern Mix Plate and her answer was ""Middle Eastern Food.""and walked away only to return later and be just as rude to us. We walked out and she yelled out ""excellent, excellent. That's how I like to do business. "" I think she was drunk."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Choice relaxed and spacious venue for a spot of light lunch after walking the city. Beautifully presented falafels and comfortable seating with a very laid back ambience and free WiFi. Cool sounds in the background and a friendly service.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Very smart, social, and entertaining hostess, and lots of fun progressive political statements. Outdoor seating makes dining in (out) during covid possible. Interesting art and murals abound"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I thought that the place was very cozy.  I went there because of a meeting invitation by the online language-learning program DUOLINGO for people learning Portuguese.  I'd not known about Café International before.  The woman (owner, maybe?) from whom I bought my coffee and donut was very friendly and treated her customers as ""special"".  It looked like they had a nice lunch menu, as well as breakfast."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Everybody loves Zahra! This place is the kind of place you want in San Francisco. A neighborhood institution. Great coffee, good food, and a very relaxed vibe. Can get beer and wine too. A community gathering space."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This is simply my favorite Cafe in the world. Yes, it's a bold statement, but it's true.  The coffee is incredible. Whether you're drinking hot, black coffee, cappuccinos, lattes, or whatever caffeine fix you need, you will be well taken care of. They have tasty, fresh, well-made products at a great price.  The salads, soups, pastries, smoothies, egg breakfasts, bagels, sandwiches, and everything else on their menu hits the spot. ALL the ingredients are fresh, delicious, and most importantly, made with love.  The wi-fi is quick, space aplenty, and a beautiful back patio. The cafe supports local artists, has open mic Friday, and Jazz on Sunday evenings. This place is magical.  And it's all because of Zahra and her incredible staff. Zahra (and the Cafe) are institutions in San Francisco and the Lower Haight. She is the sweetest, realest, and most loving person you will ever meet. Please take the time to have a quick conversation with her and your heart will be fuller, your day will be better, and you'll feel inspired to take on the day.  I love Zahra, I love the Cafe, and if you are ever in San Francisco, take a trip here to have a cup of coffee, some breakfast/lunch, and spend an hour or two relaxing in this magical place. You will be very happy you did."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Jazz nite...good coffee ...place in back with beautiful mural where you can smoke
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Fantastic food and super accommodating. Owner was very friendly. I highly recommend this great establishment
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"THE food is simple,  tasty,  made to order.  Kid friendly atmosphere,  live music, Open Mix Friday nites,  big band Sunday afternoon.  Computer access,  friendly staff.  Unisex restroom,  pet friendly ."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Zara, the owner, is one of the sweetest people you will meet and always takes care of you. I really like the vibe here, it's very San Francisco. Good coffee, good Meditteranean food, good prices. I wouldn't recommend it if you're hardcore about getting work done on the internet, but it's great to people watch and get a feeling for Lower Haight."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I go here all the time. Zahra is the best. My favorite item are the smoothies. A friend of mine looooooves the Middle Eastern Plate. A lot of food for a good price.  It's a chill place, with fast wifi and even outlets (if you can sit near one).  They also serve alcohol and in the evenings there are various bands that play.  It's my main cafe and I'm a huge fan."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Wonderful place to chill and appreciate how international this Cafe is (in all the best ways).
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Note: Cafe International is temporarily closed. Scheduled to reopen on April 1, 2019.  This review is from a previous visit.  Cash only. Zahra, the Uber friendly owner from Eritrea suggests using the ATM in the corner of the restaurant, and claims it has the lowest fees.  I tried the everything bagel sandwich with avocados, hummus, micro greens, tomatoes, onions - think deconstructed, along with a side of mini fruit salad.  Zahra asks me if I can set up a cute girl with a nose ring with a nice boy. You get how friendly the conversation gets.  The coffee was a little too sweet for my liking, but they had non dairy options. What do you expect with mocha.  They have more than your usual share of coffee options as well as breakfast sandwiches/bagels.  The place is a hippie paradise. The bathroom is covered in graffiti and scribbles that remind you of the Haight Ashbury heydays and nefarious plans to install world peace."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Cafe International has the best baked tofu sandwich I've ever had!  The seasonings/sauce they use is unique, simple, delicious and light, and wonderful. Breakfasts are a treat; your bagel is served with hummus, sprouts, tomato and red onion sliced paper thin, and it comes with a fruit cup or some other side.  Who else serves a bagel and hummus with a side?  They have a wide variety of sandwiches, smoothies, bakery treats, etc.  Zara (Zhora?) is warm and efficient at the same time, gladly substituting whatever is usual for whatever they got.  The coffee is great.  The decor is, as one other reviewer said, quintessentially San Francisco - and real, not the simulacrum found in many trendy places.  The old ""Fillmore's"" sign is still mounted on the wall above the free periodicals shelf.  The floors are worn and beautiful, local artists hang their works on the wall.  They have mix-and-match tables, chairs and coffee mugs.  No, it's not ""Starbucks pretty.""  It's really pretty.  There's internet access, of course.  Have I mentioned prices?  Downright reasonable.  In fact, I don't know how she does it.  And they have backyard seating!  The patio is decorated with well done murals by talented artists.  This is my favorite lazy morning or afternoon hangout, even though I've moved to the Mission District now."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"The place is currently CLOSED for renovation. The sign says it was expecting to open some time in Feb, but as of Mar 3rd 2019 it's still closed and empty inside. EDIT x Zahra: Thanks for the info. 5 stars without visiting seemed unfair. 1 star for being close for renovation seemed also unfair. But people should now this place is temporarily closed and there's no way I found to leave a comment without putting some number of stars .. :) Looking forward to visit it when it opens back and revise it!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"spacious cafe but music is a bit loud esp. if you don't like reggae. informed owner about internet dropping in and out and she just gave me a phone number to call, which i just got a voice message. probably won't come back.."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Great food, nice neighborhood spot. Free local music at night as well! Still a Wonderful place in the Lower Haight"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Amazing everytime I come!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,The last time I was here was over 15 years ago and it's still the same. Great customer service and great food and coffee. Looking forward to going back again on my next visit to SF.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"This place is awesome!! I was looking for a good spot to get some work done and cafe international killed it with the fast wifi, comfy seats, and calming music :)"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Very nice people.  Fantastic vibe.  Ordered Lemon ginger tea and they gave me the teabag, but they also gave me fresh ginger and fresh lemon. Very comfortable to sit down. Nice crowd."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"I just had the worst coffee in San Francisco! The soup had whole unground pepper in it. Not very pleasant. Some dried out, overpriced falafel. Rude guy on the counter. This city has so many fine cafés; can't imagine why anyone would waste their time at this place."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"What a cool spot. Loved the live jazz on Sunday afternoon by ""Miles Ahead"" from 4-9pm. Worth checking out, very San Franciscan vibe here."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Very basic place, no frills but good quality coffee and a very nice woman working there.  Nice vibe overall.  My only suggestion is they somehow improve their lighting because it's pretty bad."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,The food is inexpensive and tasty! The space is calming and creative with fantastic music playing regularly. And the staff is so considerate and friendly. Thank you!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,I’ve played at two open mic nights now and everyone is lovely. Such a great atmosphere and good beer and staff as well!
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Large space and A lot of food choices.  Lovely inviting back patio, with clean wooden tables.  Friendly staff; they take care of you."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Love this place.  It's one of the last vestiges of the genuine, old Lower Haight.  Good food.  Fresh OJ.  Zara is the queen of the neighborhood!"
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Fairly straight cafe, but free jazz on Sunday evening makes this a standout place. Patio just behind the band, and you are outside and may smoke."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,"Fantastic place, I made Cafe International my second home while I'm in SF. Try the tofu sandwich. The staff is funny and very friendly, love it."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Coffee is burnt tast old

Cafe International,508 Haight St,"It's a lovely atmosphere, particularly the courtyard area."
Cafe International,508 Haight St,I miss this place so much.  Whenever I am back in San Francisco I stop by for a coffee and amazingly no matter how long I have been away Zhara remembers my name which always made this little café feel like a home away from home.
Cafe International,508 Haight St,Good place for coffee! The place has been there for years. Appreciated the Ethiopian lady who speaks Spanish.
