Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great little place with a lot of character and friendly service.  Whether it’s for coffee, food or a beer, you won’t be disappointed.  Stop by if you’re in the area."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I've lived in sunset for over 20 years, always passing by but never stopped by. First time today with hubby, and he had the espresso Latte, and I had the Butterscotch Latte and Wow! Perfect coffee ratio to sweetness. We didn't have to add any sugar to it.  We also shared a Vegetarian breakfast burrito and we loved it!  There was corn, black bean, cheese, scrambled egg and sauce wrapped with perfectly toasted tortilla wrap. Perfect size for breakfast."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"A small place with lots of character... and very good breakfast food that we enjoyed while we waited fro the zoo to open. The almond croissant was not overly sugared or sweet, as so many of them are... and the bacon breakfast burrito had bacon that was actually crisp and thick, unlike the soft, mushy bacon often found in other breakfast burritos. The orange juice was fresh-made, the espresso was quite satisfying. The staff were friendly and busy at three same time. A steady flow of customers showed that this small place has built up a following."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Extremely friendly service, neat things to try. I went back less than an hour later. They also serve alcohol but have a limited selection. Limited seating as well but overall enjoyable experience."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Best smoked salmon I've had yet! My husband had the sausage sandwich and loved it but took half of my bagel because he loves salmon. The berry soda bread was yummy! The vanilla latte and butterscotch latte was AMAZING!!!!
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Less than acceptable sandwich today. Ordered a turkey club sand got this. Chicken, but not only that the chunks are huge, too large for a sandwich."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"The food here is tasty and the location is top notch by the zoo and ocean. However the service is not pleasant. The staff not friendly, and the loud speaker calling when your food is ready is so annoying. We ordered salmon bagel and mozzarella melt. They both tasted great but the way that they served the sandwich stacked wasn’t appealing and I’m not sure why they would stack several mozzarella breads on top of each other."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,incredible!! oat milk cortados were perfect & that sun dried tomato cream cheese was impeccable
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Great bagels! The lox bagel on asiago was delicious and hot. Easy walking distance from ocean beach and the zoo. Lots of parking. Can do walk up or dine in
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great people, great customer service, fast service. Really helped they didn't care I brought a dog in, there was no where to tie her off."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Easy free parking, near hotels, zoo, Beach, Irish Cultural Center and a streetcar and bus line. The coffee is fine and ask the customers were very contented, many loyal regulars."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,I come here for the Tsunami sandwich and it never disappoints! I get the coffees as well but the sando is the big ticket.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Excellent ambiance - a great balance of chill and social. It was quiet enough that I could tutor virtually, but not so quiet that I felt out of place doing so.  Solid Wi-Fi, nice menu selection, and clean bathroom."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Super cute place!! Great customer service, definitely going back!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Got a small hot chocolate and it took them about 2 minutes. Very nice interior and workers.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great food, plenty of table space. Easy parking!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Outstanding food and customer service!
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Mixed up my vegan order. Got sick from cream cheese. DoorDash won’t even post review. People be careful and make sure you got what you ordered.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Great coffee and breakfast bagel sandwiches. Beautiful on a nice day to enjoy the beach
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"We had probably the best chicken club sandwich EVAR! Nice people, and cute atmosphere. We wanted to try their Irish Soda Bread, but they had sold out by noon. Must be popular!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Local coffee ☕️  shop across the street from the zoo and a few blocks from the ocean.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Good coffee nice place to Relax and enjoy the the coffee is close to the ocean and the zoo a lot parking
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"The food was fresh and tasty! (We didn't try the java.) They had one of the best croissants I have had outside of France. If you want one of their bagels, go early in the day - they were mostly gone by 3 pm."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"The coffee was wonderful, potato soup was tasty. The breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwiches were still very cold inside (partially frozen in the center and cold surrounding), the flavor was good, but the lack of warmth caused some drops in stars. Some of the staff was kind, most of the staff appeared to not care about their jobs. Due to the flavor of the food, and the delicious coffee, I give this three stars."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,love this place so much. everything is always delicious and everyone is super nice
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,First visit to this restaurant although I have passed it hundreds of times while traveling to Ocean Beach. I thought it was another burger joint -- not at all. More like a Mexican cuisine. I had a turkey sandwhich with pesto on a multigrain breaf. Very good! It came with chips. I plan on visiting it again.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,A little slow at times (or busy with a lot of orders) but usually worth the wait. A must stop when in that area of SF. Totally pet friendly. There is an old fast-food statue of a giant red dog face nearby. Try to see if you can learn it's weird history.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Holy moly that’s the best butterscotch latte in the world! Need more! Can you run a 64oz for $6.40? So I can sip that all the way down the beach!! Yum!! Also the salmon bagel. exquisite. delectable.  and light, even with all that cream cheese!! I lightly salted, and put a pack of pepper on there, perfection! Wasn’t sure I was going to like salmon for breakfast, but wow was I wrong! And very nice friendly staff! Thank you for  making beach day great!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"In town for business and looking for a breakfast spot.  Hit this place up and had the salmon bagel.  It was delicious. Stonefly suggest this place. They got my buddies order mixed up, he didn't order cream cheese but got it, he ate it anyways and loved it."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Over priced….$13 for a mineral water and a sausage egg muffin. Nothing special about the sandwich…falls right in the average category…cashier could at least be welcoming..
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,I had a great time here and the servers were amazing. Overall a great place to check out.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I really enjoy their sandwiches.  The salads are good but I have to try more of their items. Overall,  it's a great place for lunch or a cup of coffee.  I don't think you can have a bad lunch time here.  Free Internet is a plus"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,A very nice spot for breakfast. 30$ a breakfast for 2 which is still quite expensive for French people but in the average of what you could get at San Francisco.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great sandwiches, friendly stuff, nice outside seats. I particularly want to mention hot chocolate, which was really tasty and was not over-sweetened. Many US places tend to add too much sugar to drinks  which make them tasteless, but here it was a proper cocoa/chocolate."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great breakfast / lunch spot, with a large selection of sandwiches (both cold and hot), pastries, and bagels. Nice coffee too! Hard to beat, especially because it's directly by the entrance to the SF zoo!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I was driving with a friend heading towards the beach when we spotted Java Beach and found easy parking right in front. The latte I had was good and they offered food and alcohol too! They even had beer on tap. It was a nice quick stop with good drinks, friendly service, and lots of menu options."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Really enjoy going to this place to get coffee.   Not a starbucks, and that is a good thing.   The staff is friendly, and generally the food is served hot.   Limited menu with salads and sandwiches, but I like to go there early in the morning and buy my guilty pleasure donut"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,I like sandwiches over here. Cashier was nice and helpful.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I stoped in for a coffee just passing by and decided to try the Irish bread. I am so glad I did ,it is perfection. Moist, light, a tad sweet. I had 2 the raisin and fresh fruit . I craved it over the next day and then went back and had a piece and took two more to go . Service is friendly and atmosphere is pleasant . defiantly come try this secret Family recipe for Irish soda bread ."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Java Beach is one of my new favorite coffee spots. From the outside seating, there is a beautiful view of the Pacific ocean, and when it's nice outside it feels like heaven. The coffee is also amazing at Java Beach, and so are the pastries and other things they sell. Prices are a little expensive but still reasonable compared to other places in the city. Employees are very helpful and kind."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great sandwiches (including vegetarian options) near the beach. The staff is really friendly and the coffee is good. There's also outdoor seating if you come with a dog, this is a good neighbourhood spot!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Nice little coffee shop across the street from the Zoo. Good selection coffee and tea with a nice variety of food options. Great ingredients and execution. My only complaint would be that both the front ordering and seating areas felt a little cramped.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Since we have been coming here since 2000 be it for brew or food, my wife and I have never been disappointed at the Java Beach-Zoo. A number of sandwiches from have made it in find shape from here to PacBell Park, now Oracle Park🎉 …"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,We come here almost every week and are never disappointed. We love Java beach!!! Their bagels in the morning make my whole day. My personal favorite is the pesto veggie bagel. Sitting outside on a nice and sunny day is my perfect morning.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Very friendly staff. Had a breakfast burrito and my husband loved it and he's not up breakfast burrito type of person.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I ordered from this place a couple of times. One time, I ordered a sandwich over the phone... Waited 15min went there, and sandwich was not ready. Waited another 10min... I get the sandwich, it was extremely sloppy; box was covered in oil. And the most important part... They screwed up on my sandwich. Second time, they screw up on my order and almost charged me double the price of the sandwich if I hadn't say anything about the price. Had a terrible experience here. Went a block up for better service and quality sandwiches"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"We always visit when we're in the neighborhood. Coffee and the chai are great, and it's nice to sit outside when the weather cooperates. Recommend getting the Irish soda bread if you come early enough! Both sweet and savory options."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Cool place in a good spot near the beach. Has a good variety of food and good atmosphere. The design, like most things in SF, is a bit cramped and it can feel a bit crowded or hard to find a place to sit. You can always grab it to go and walk down to the beach"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Tight on covid days but enough workers to make run smoothly, years since back but ev e n more menu items, but NO Thai Tea nor Bobbas yet,  just not enough room she said is all. OMG the sandwiches are huge!!! Worth the 10.95 alone bring a friend. Even a 420 p e ruin munchi. Out said it was alot! Haha"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Java Beach Cafe at the Zoo: excellent Irish soda bread, the bacon and cheddar is the best. Food is good all around, good coffee and even soft serve ice cream for hot days at the beach. Sit at the bar and read the historic picture book of the building of the location for an entertaining coffee break."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I would have given it 4 stars. Everything is great there but when I ordered my Irish soda bread they forgot and when I asked about it they said it was probably getting toasted. They checked, it wasn't there. They then took the soda bread off the rack and put it in a bag and handed it to me. I didn't say anything at the time but she must have known I could feel it wasn't toasted. So, in conclusion they forgot my order, didn't communicate that to me and also when I got it it wasnt toasted.  It was definitely a small thing but left me a little dissatisfied. I'll definitely go back and hopefully update this review with a better experience."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Perfect coffe, vegetable soup of the day, and one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in the United States!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Great spot across from the Zoo.  Grap a coffee and  bagel before the beach or Zoo.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Went to Java Beach on Sloat. Incredibly rude cashier working at 3pm today. Did not catch her name... When I ordered my food, she was very snappy, dismissing and not informative. I asked her about soup choices and she pointed at a board and said tomato soup. Then continuously asked, “ what else? What else? What else?” 3-4 times. When I sat down a customer next to me had some other type of creamy white soup... so apparently there was something other than tomato soup. As I was drinking my coffee, I heard her complaining about homework assignments behind me. Towards the end of my meal, I asked her for a to go containers and she requested one of her male coworkers to assist me. Again, dismissing me and not letting me finish my sentence. Since I did not finish what I was initially asking for, she did not hear me say; I needed a to go coffee cup. I had to ask her again, and she responded; “for what?” I have worked in the cafe industry for years, I understand the balance of personal life and work can be tricky. However, letting a “few papers to write” impact your ability to give good customer service is ridiculous. Your the face of the cafe. At least pretend good customer service. Food was delicious."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,A absolutely thee best place. Coffee great. My daughter just loves the soft serve and ice cream drinks. Very friendly. Neighborhood cafe
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"The veggie sandwich was good, but not great, and over priced at $10. The kids liked the ham and grilled cheese sandwich. The coleslaw was too spicy. They were out of all bagels except for cinnamon raisin."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Great little local spot close to the zoo and the beach! Small but everyone is friendly and there are outside seats! Pastries, muffins, bagels, salads, and sandwiches. Everything we ordered was delicious 😋 …"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"We went to this place for the first time, but the food was quite expensive and not that great. Nothing we had was that good. We had a mocha, two salads, two orange juices, and one BLT sandwich, which costs over $55. If you can find somewhere else to go, I recommended it. Also, the mocha was cold and not hot as it should have been."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,The Butterscotch Latte was AMAZING!
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Love stopping in for a Cappucino after my walk on the Great Highway. Java Beach has great coffee and for a splurge, they offer Soft Serve Ice Cream Cones!!!! Yum!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Right across from the San Francisco Zoo and near Ocean Beach.  Street parking is available, but limited.  Food is good, but pricey.  Don't let the exterior dissuade you.  It is quite charming, and outdoor seating is available."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"This place used to be open 'till 11pm which made it one of my favorites late night coffee-shops but now they are open 'till 8pm. I usually order a hot veggie with mozzarella and cheddar cheese with a 16oz Arnold Palmer. The sub is good and the drink is ok, what's great about this place is that they are a very diverse sweeteners (agave, honey, syrups, etc ) and milks ( rice, almods, and the regulars) and they are all free!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I always like this place but today the server was not polite at all. And also, now they serve it to you out the window?? Im sorry, but how much longer are we going to play the covid game here? Are there no clean tables to sit and enjoy my coffee?"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"the worst service I have ever received, first they lost my order online, then they said I was lying, even showing receipt and order confirmation they delivered the wrong order.  Don't waste your time going there!!!"
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Great vanilla bean latte.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"great coffee and excellent chai tea. 5 beers on tap too. not much indoor space for seating/always packed, but beach is quite nearby. wifi and an outdoor seating area as well. easy parking"

Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Great coffee shop. The have muffins and sandwiches and free wifi.  The only problem is finding an empty table because some people sit at tables with their computers for long periods of time.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Would love having this BLT and coleslaw for breakfast just about any morning.  Great coffee, too! And I love the original artwork by a local woman."

Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,The coffee it's very good and also the atention!
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Indifferent service. BLT for $13.50 that could have been made by a toddler. No wonder there’s no lunch crowd.

Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Close to ocean across from the zoo. Very good sandwiches and drinks. The gypsy tea is very good. Great view from outside while eating.
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"I had just purchased my 3RE cup of over priced coffee when I was approached by app police officer, who informed me that he had received a call from the cafe. And that I would have to leave. When I asked him why he suggested that it may be because of my bicycle and bike trailer that I had parked completely out of the way , tucked beside of the area where their compost and recycle cans were placed.  I find the atmosphere there to be very uptight and obviously judgemental. And I suggest that no one who is not a complete snob should visit the premises on fear of being arrested or at least very embarrassed, as I was that day."
Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,"Refreshing area of the city.. next to ocean beach, San Francisco Zoo, lake Merced, SFSU. Great coffee, nice and strong. Great staff."

Java Beach At The Zoo,2650 Sloat Blvd,Kind of disappointed when I rented it seems like they cut the sandwich and ask my wife and I always get the tsunami it was very small we took out one meat it was not substituted with another and it's pretty pricey for a sandwich $12 for the tsunami
