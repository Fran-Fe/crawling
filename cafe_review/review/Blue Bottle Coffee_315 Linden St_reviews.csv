Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Amazing coffee! The cops go here so you know it’s good! Went there today. And oh, look at their featured flower arrangement when you visit, today’s was stunning! I ordered a Cappucino with Almond Milk - it was stellar."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I would have had no clue this little place was here if it wasn’t for the line of people outside. My Sweet Latte was prepared quickly and tastes great. Places like this are what I love finding. 4.9/5.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,The seasonal matcha was absolutely lovely and the staff was very friendly :) the seasonal flavor right now is orange blossom and I really enjoyed it :) looking forward to visiting again to catch the next seasonal flavor :) 💕🙂 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I was looking for a Blue Bottle location nearby and discovered this. Didn’t realize that this even existed as it’s off Hayes. I got there just before the main rush. Line seems to move quickly.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Love this coffee shop. I could smell the rich aroma of the coffee beans the moment I stepped inside. Their latte was smooth and had a well-rounded flavor. Definitely going to be my go-to spot!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I wish they had one of these in Minnesota. I’m visiting SF for a few days and this place was highly recommended by a friend. Being a huge coffee lover, I was in love with this place by just looking at the menu, I was so confused what I should start my order with. Settled for a good old cup of dark roast drip coffee, it was delicious. I’ll be visiting a few more time before I leave the town and hope they open a few in MN."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"delicious Hōjisha latte : this was my first time trying it as a friend recommended it to me and wow, did I enjoy this. Service is very fast even tho there was a bit of queue. Atmosphere-wise, the store looks very messy behind the counter but being a bit hidden inside a street with nowhere to sit makes it feel like you found some kind of secret store :)  I recommend it, but maybe go to another of their stores if you are looking for a comfy place to sit inside while enjoying your drink."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Unique location, nice area to walk around, and reliably great coffee. Don't love that they're owned by Nestle, but the staff here are amazing and so skilled. The wait's never bad, even if there's a line. Worth a visit if you're in the area!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Absolute cutest location in the alley.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about thier coffee, and always make great recommdations. Blue bottle is my favorite coffee in the city. The coffee is super smooth and creamy, and the nola- delicious!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Some of the best coffee in town. Every Blue Bottle location seems to just do it right…  We tried the Iced Nola Latte and the Gibraltar (not on the menu - remnant of a flat white). Both were made to perfection and the espresso here is to die for… craving it as I write this down and definitely going to be back…
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Great little pop up Blue Bottle! Quick service and amazing quality as you can expect! Really close to the Hayes valley shops! You might miss it if you're not looking for it
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Great Blue Bottle cafe / stand in the Hayes Valley neighbourhood. Really cool spot,  check it out!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Original Blue Bottle location! If you like Blue Bottle the this is worth a visit. Still operates out of a garage! As usual, minimal frills."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Small coffee place built out of a garage - how creative! Excellent coffee 😻 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Fast and friendly. This spot wasn't more than a hole in the wall, but the oatmilk latte was delicious!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The cutest store for blue bottle and quick place to get your coffee. It is as good as other locations, love blue bottle as usual."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"It's a little hole-in-the-wall that serves Blue Bottle coffee and a few bakery items. But the coffee...yum.  You can get latte or espresso drinks, but nothing with a syrup like, say, a vanilla latte.  Across the alley are some benches and beautiful murals, or Octavia park is a block away, so there are many options to sit outside and enjoy your beverage."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Excellent coffee and friendly service! I love their cappuccino! They do get busy at times, and they don’t have enough staff—yielding long wait times occasionally. I just walk on by and go to a different coffee shop when they get busy. The pastries are not worth the high prices (lower quality and very tiny sizes—I was very disappointed with their chocolate croissant), so don’t waste your money on those. But the coffee is great! Recommend!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"This is my favorite coffee shop on San Francisco. The coffee is always on point, the staff is always welcoming, and the baked goods are exactly what you need."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,The original blue bottle. Staff is friendly. They do not have free samples.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Great little take away coffee Shop- there are a few special spots to sit around and enjoy your coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,DON'T FORGET HAVE A CUP OF BLUE BOTTLE IN HAYES VALLEY WHICH IS THE FIRST BLUE BOTTLE BRANCH.  LOVELY-
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I asked for a Mocca Latte and it was the best I ever had. Mmmm
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Love Blue Bottle coffee...it is smooth and enjoyable and this walk up cafe/kiosk is great for a Sunday treat with my dog. However I look forward to the opening of a closer Blue Bottle on South Van Ness soon!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Coffee was good but I'm missing this place's original charm. Cashier was curt and I was served a 12 ounce when I requested 8. Sad that it came with a pricetag and I wasn't gutsy to enough to just return the milked-down drink.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Blue bottle has opted to oat milk and increased its price. Other milk others are available upon requested.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Same OG outpost in what is now a battered Linden alley. Although the city and local organizations have tried to maintain the area around the several shops on this one way street its not a pleasant scene to linger over your morning coffee at this point in history. Not dangerous, just a sharp seedy contrast to the shiny Blue Bottle kiosk that offers everything coffee. Espressos and cortados are consistently excellent. Seasonal roasts depend on your taste. Usually they have some baked goods and canned cold coffee drinks as well. Worth a stop if you're in the area and want to see where a quasi historical location."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Cappuccinos so creamy and sweet they are like drinking a dessert! I also had a cup of black coffee on a prior visit that was about as good as coffee can get. Bursting with flavor from great beans and Blue Bottle's signature pour over brewing it was the  BEST cup I've enjoyed in a long time.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Delicious and a unique, hole in the wall experience. Staff are friendly and get the line moving quickly! Highly recommend!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I enjoy the cappuccinos here. I consider myself the purveyor of fine coffee, Blue Bottle is ok and this location is fast and convenient if you work in Hayes Valley. If you're looking for tasty baked goods you might select another location though, those aren't that great- there are several cafes around with comparable coffee, but this kiosk is probably the most efficient if you just seek a quick cup."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Delicious drip coffee and other caffeine boosting options.  This place is a coffee science house, so it is definitely worth the trip.  They brew a select batch everyday meaning you can go multiple times for a different tasting.  The food is very good also and Blue Bottle has many locations around the city.  This location in particular is near the Tenderloin district, so don't plan on enjoying your coffee walking around the area unless you head north only."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Love Blue Bottle Coffee! Although it’s not an official location. It’s more of a hole in a wall place. They don’t offer Affogato, but there is an ice cream place right near them and they will pour some espresso shots into your ice cream. They are nice and friendly! Their coffee is the best. Like"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Tucked away in an alley is a coffee bar stand that makes some amazing drip coffee. One of my best friends took me here for our morning coffee fix prior to breakfast. I picked out their shortbread cookie and was also happy that this place made some decent baked goods in addition to their perfectly brewed coffee. Be prepared to wait in line as this place draws crowds. I particularly love the location of this Blue Bottle for the mere fact that I can get an awesome cup of coffee in an alley…
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"My wife and I went straight to this coffee shop after we have arrived in SF after a long flight.  We were not disappointed with the taste of coffee.  But interestingly Blue Bottle Coffee is Tokyo had better latte...  Anyway, good to have been to the main shop."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Loved it! Delicious butternut squash tasting latte on 2 percent milk! Interesting flavours. I got the NOLA iced coffee which was on the sweet side for me but delicious! I’d love to come back for some avo toast with fried eggs. Wish this wasn’t a chain as I like more local coffee shops better and like to support local. The Mint St location is better than most as they have full service and food
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"You'll always find a line at this tiny, pop-up style coffee bar. Blue Bottle has excellent coffee and espresso. I really enjoy the cold brew. You might feel a little intimidated by the staff but they're efficient and will get you your coffee quickly."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The most unassuming coffee shop that I've ever been to. You will most definitely miss it if you dont' look for it. Got a standard latte and I have to say, its probably the best coffee I've had in San Francisco. Would've rated it 5 stars if not for the lack of a proper stirring station. A bigger seating area would also be definitely welcome."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"This place has some of the best coffee I have ever tasted. Coffee is sourced from a variety of locations all over the world. Hand ground, pressed, and made into one the finest cups of coffee that you'll ever have. They have only a few locations so far, 3 in San Fran, 1 in Tokyo and they just opened one in NYC. Definitely gives Starbucks reserve a run for their money."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Please tell me who doesn't love a random alleyway filled with innocent bystanders drinking copious amounts of caffeine in an attempt to start there day? No matter what time it is Linden Street is always a popular SF destination. The cozy garage door coffee shop is one of the best known places in the bay area to get your buzz on.  That little blue bottle is taunting for sure so even if it's your eighth cup of the day make sure to check this place out. You wont regret it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Amazing coffee! I went to the Blue Bottle Coffee location on Abbot Kinney in Venice, California, and their baristas were as nice as they were talented with their craft. Most second-wave coffee houses make you feel intimidated, but Blue Bottle is inviting and they show a genuine appreciation for your business and are ready to answer your questions and help you pick the best coffee during your visit. 5 Stars!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Another brand name establishment, but well worth it's reputation. The coffee is quite good and for a hot summers day, I would recommend the Nola Ice Coffee. Their pour-overs are also great and the price is affordable. However, if you prefer quiet and calm coffee shops, this place might not be the one for you. Definitely a trendy spot!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Super cute hole in the wall place near Patricia's Green! The coffee is top notch and they also have cookies and other pastries. The cappuccino is super smooth! They are dog friendly too and have dog treats at the register. Only complaints are that it's pretty pricey and there aren't many places to sit outside.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Great coffee, especially if you're an SF coffee snob. I personally am not and still love this coffee. I drink this coffee black, and never add anything. Terrific stuff. Tons of great things to do in this area after you pick up a cup you can stroll around and shop/window shop. Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Love coffee?!? Currently in San Francisco?!? Whether you live here or you're just visiting, do yourself a favor and get a cup of love from this locally grown java joint! I'm a coffee purest, I drink my coffee black. I had a cappuccino from here that was everything a cappuccino should be. The milk was steamed to perfection. It wasn't scorched or bland like many chain coffee places sell you. It was creamy and sweet. The ratio of coffee milk and foam was spot on! Having worked in a local and a two different chain coffee companies I can tell you that most of the time you will not get this kind of tasty beverage from a chain. THIS type of coffee comes from people who see it as an art, much like a chef sees a meal as a work of art.  I'm going back! I'm going today actually! I loved it that much! This location is a small opening in an alley but not a scary alley where you feel you're going to lose your wallet to an unsavory individual. No, this is a quaint alley with personality. One where you wish they had a couple tables and chairs or benches so you could sit and sip your cup of heaven! I can't wait to try the New Orleans Iced Coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Soy cappuccino = go to order here. Their espresso is so creamy and never once has been burnt tasting. I have also gotten their drip coffee, delicious as well, though I must say I frequent their other options more so. New Orleans iced coffee on a hot day is also a great treat. Oh, and the efforts put into the latte art are worth an extra dollar in the tip jar, these people know their coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,BE CAREFUL !they serve Real coffee😂✌🏻😍 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Hands down one of my favorite spots to grab coffee in the city both because of the quality of the coffee and the ambiance of this particular Blue Bottle location. This spot is basically an outdoor cafe and is almost always sunny. There are hip wood and cement benches for you to enjoy your beverage. Perfect for a sunny break from the 9 to 5 grind. The mocha is rich and thoughtfully crafted; I don't usually like sweet coffee, but the things they do with that Tcho dark chocolate are absolutely incredible. Be warned, though, Blue Bottle is definitely a classic San Francisco bougie coffee shop that'll set you back nearly $7 for one coffee. Yikes!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"These guys seriously put the most care into making your coffee and hand-crafting it like it were just to your liking and taste. I love their pour-overs; they are super strong and rich in flavor. There is usually a lengthy weight, but it is well worth it if you like a good cup of Joe."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"From East Coast to West, Blue Bottle Coffee may be the best coffee you will be able to find. Luckily, it's decadence can be found in every niche and groove of San Francisco (and if you're even luckier, elsewhere in the US). Somehow the world appears to be a better place when you start your morning with their foamy injection of caffeine. You know the coffee is of better quality when there is a massive difference in a simple nonfat latte. You really cannot go wrong in what you order here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I love Blue Bottle Coffee. Once you drink quality coffee... you'll wonder why you drank starbucks for all those years.  I usually get the mocha.. and it's quite good.. not watered down too much with chocolate on your other conventional coffee shops.  Worth the price and wait.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Good coffee, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  It's definitely a step above Starbucks, but I think there are better options in SF for gourmet coffee.  It's definitely in the upper echelon of coffee places, and tastes are subjective, so give it a try if you like good coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Really good coffee, but quite expensive. This is their original shop and being in a small alley it's a bit hidden from casual view. It feels more authentic and is less crowded than their Ferry Building store, though you'll always find someone here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"This place is my coffee heaven. Their coffee cannot be beat and they probably have the most knowledgeable baristas in the world. The drip coffee is meticulously prepared in all of its forms and I highly recommend trying them all, as they all have different flavors. Just watching them make it is a blast too! You may be intimidated by the line and semi-snooty vibe, but it's definitely worth it!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I love peering down an alleyway to find a top notch coffee kiosk. Blue Bottle roasts beautifully earthy, rich coffee and prides themselves on crafting perfect cups. Your order will take a bit longer but it's well worth the wait. Extra points for accepting credit cards."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"It was pretty good coffee.  If seating is a concern, there is a park at the end of the alley (Hayes Green/Patricia's Green), where you can sit and enjoy your fresh cup.  It's a pleasant park with joggers and people with dogs.  I like to keep it simple with my coffee and just go with a regular drip and cream.  Can't beat brewed fresh by the cup...and it was pretty good- not an overwhelming flavor like Peet's, and not underwhelming like Starbucks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,One of the best coffe places and joints out there in the City.  Coffee is fresh and tastes oh-so-good.  Lines can get rather long especially in the morning for all those that want to get their java fix.  Recommend it though compared to other coffee houses.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,This is one of the first store fronts for Blue Bottle and you would think that there could be a lot of attitude but I find the baristas there to be very workmanlike and down to earth. Their consistency is excellent and I also like that they don't make their espresso drinks too hot.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I got a small latte with heavy cream for $7! No options for any flavoring besides a mocha or sugar. No sugar free besides just don't add no sugar!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"This location is tucked away in an alley and the line is surprisingly long...but worth the wait!  My husband is a big fan of their drip coffee and I like the little sweets they offer.  If you're walking around Hayes Valley or waiting for your name to be called at Stacks, this is a great place to get your morning cup of Joe.  A nice iced cup is even better!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Great pop up style shop / vibe. Coffee is made quickly and tastes great.  Not a spot to sit and do work. It’s perfect for ordering to go and then walking around the neighborhood.  $5 for a latte.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Venture into the alley off Patricia's Green graciously named Linden ""street"" and you'll find Blue Bottle tucked away in a garage. It's not hard to find -- just look for the line of coffee aficionados who know what's what. And, the thing is, you may have heard the hype -- but the hype is worth it. Along with a couple of newer contenders, Blue Bottle is easily in the top tier of San Francisco coffeedom, and if it's an espresso drink you're after, it will be made exactingly. But seriously, this coffee is so good you could drink it black. Hayes Valley remains my favorite Blue Bottle location even though they have quite a few of them now, but you'll never go truly wrong with any of the locations."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Located down a side street in Hayes Valley one wouldn't expect to find one of the best coffee places in San Francisco. Located in the side of the building, this wouldn't be the best spot if you want to sit down with your computer for hours, but it's great if you want a truly awesome coffee as you stroll the San Francisco treats. I got a mocha made with tcho chocolate. Delicious, simple and simply no qualms about it. They do something when they steam the milk that is right on."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Me and my friend were wanting some coffee because of her low energy but we found a cute place that played awesome music with a cute little outside feel. It's not in the most convenient area as there are some homeless people outside but I like how their security and the staff was really nice.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"This fun little shop seems to be converted from an old garage, so there isn't any seating, but for the most part just a grab and go. There's a small standing bar for people who want to drink there. The NOLA iced coffee ($4) was very good. Prices seemed to be on par with Starbucks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I really like Blue Bottle and all of their locations. This is the original that started it all in Hayes Valley. Whatever you like, you're bound to love it. I like me an Americano or a Kyoto Iced Coffee and a Saffron Snickerdoodle. The locations by SF Centre and the Ferry Building are also splendid. But there's something about coming here and drinking coffee in an alley that seems oh so right!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Best coffee provided here. This is my best coffee shop in SF Bay Area. I don't drink coffee that much, but I can drink many of these.They also offer different types of cakes/sweet here. I love Blue bottle Machiacto. If you haven't try Blue Bottle, it means you really haven't know San Francisco that well yet. lol"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,This place is so cute! Serves right out of the storefront & is situated on the cutest landscaped alley. Great coffee in a great spot to sit after walking!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Staff was so helpful, and the coffee is great. It’s in a garage and feels like your walking up to a coffee cart at a yard sale.  There is a bench near if it’s available. I love blue bottle, and only worth the visit because it’s them and your on the go."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The original Blue Bottle is a hole-in-the-wall at its best. This must have been a converted garage or something, but as we all know this is where great things usually take off from.  Blue Bottle certainly has their own flavor profile, some like it, some not. I personally swing both ways (coffee, that is) - I like Blue Bottle's but also the sweetness of Philz' mixed creations. Prices are what'd you expect from a third-wave coffee shop: Cappuccino $3, Latte $3.50"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Good coffee but overpriced pastries. Didn't realize it until I checked my bill later - $20 for a coffee, a latte, and a 'pull apart'. Not exactly affordable. Kind and welcoming service!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The best coffee, hands down, made to order.  You can find Blue Bottle being served throughout the Bay Area at lots of restaurants and cafes. It's not bitter, but full flavored, it's all in the roast!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I think Blue Bottle Coffee has some of the finest coffee of all time. The only place that comes close in my opinion is La Boulange. But if you like that full bodied, rich and bold cup. Please stop at this cafe!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"A little expensive (but maybe that’s just because I am used to WA priced coffee), but super tasty!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,hole in the wall shop in a pretty and quiet street. coffee is great although a little more on the pricey side. you can drink there with proper cups but there's not anywhere to sit.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Standard Coffee Snob Barista Service. I love the quote. Every other coffee shop has them now. College dropouts making  $9.00 an hour with no work skills acting like they're cool or something. What a laugh. But my hat is off to the ones who really care and do a good job because in my book it makes no difference what you do in life as long as you are kind.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"It's so nice to have a Blue Bottle in Hayes Valley. It seems they're a little limited on baked goods, which is reasonable for the size they are. They are small, so it gets busy quickly."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The baristas at Blue Bottle rock a mean beard and just the right amount of nonchalance.  You get the added bonus of arrogantly standing in the middle of the road being an inconvenience to people driving past and then sitting on benches in a dirty alley way, a critical element of any true coffee experience.  Unfortunately the coffee is way too acidic for my tastes and ruins the whole experience. Walk the extra half block to Ritual, it's well worth it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Told by barista with trash visible from pickup window that they are not accepting trash “due to the pandemic” no trash receptacle for over a block away.  Ritual down the street has trash available for customers even during the pandemic.  Go there:)
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"My favorite iced coffee in San Francisco, served new orleans style. The lines here are way shorter than the endless queue at the Ferry Building location. And after you're done here you can wander around the lovely Hayes Valley neighborhood."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Delicious coffee and a perma-line out the door. This is true of any of the many locations in the city, and true of most artisanal third-wave coffee spots in the city. The mocha is worth waiting for so as long as you're prepared for a line at least a dozen people deep, this cuppa goodness is where it's at."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Blue Bottle is great, especially if you like the New Orleans style coffee, as they make their iced coffee with chicory. Otherwise, I think their coffee is a bit too acidic and brewed too light for my taste. My favorite is still good ol' Philz (24th street location!).  Pro-Tip: This location is cash only."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I love blue bottle!  The drip  and New Orleans are my favorite, and this one is in a great location near shops in Hayes Valley!  Grab a cup and have a stroll!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I really loved the coffee here, and I don't even like coffee! I'm not a coffee conesuirr, (spelling is not my strong suit lol), but I can really taste teh difference between this and starbucks. The service can be a little slow sometimes because the line gets a little intense, but it's worth it. I would definitely come back!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Amazing coffee shop with excellent staff service. Everyone I've met here in SF knows about this place and drinks it religiously. If I had a coffee maker or a french press, I'd buy by the pound myself. You could always jsut go to one of these stores and buy drip coffee of a delightful cappucino. I take guests here for coffee when visiting."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"It's by far the best coffee I've ever have in town. I love it as a product and I would definitely continue to have it on every opportunity I have. The downside is the fact that they don't have much places to sit down and they're really bussy most of the times. Besides that, I would of been perfect."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Almost twice as expensive as Starbucks, standing only, the batista never bothered to ask which type of coffee and just assume I want the expensive drop coffee. Standing around waiting for thier orders are posting hipsters. And the coffee didn't taste that good. At all."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Thick creamy coffee, nice and bold. Staff were great and fast!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Tucked away in an alley, is this San Francisco gem. You will be greeted by the friendliest staff and an incredible cup of coffee. The Blue Bottle experience is flawless and I look forward to it every weekend!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Blue Bottle is my #1 favorite coffee! Brian rocks as a Barrista. Always a line because it's great coffee plus awesome customer service. I'm greeted by my first name, too."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,If you get to the the ferry building right as they open on Sun the smell of blue bottle coffee will wake you up! Get there early to enjoy the first sip of the day in quite then stroll down & find a seat to people watch as folks come in from all over to enjoy the market & shops
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Is it possible to find true love in a pastry? Yes. At Blue Bottle, the coffee is a superb and smooth ride but what I always come back for are the pastries. From delicate saffron snickerdoodles to rich olive oil shortbreads, Caitlin Freeman is a master."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Walk, don't run otherwise you might miss Blue Bottle's tiny window stand in Hayes Valley. Tucked away on Linden, closer to Gough, this Blue Bottle location offers coffee, baked goods, and a small garden with benches along Linden to catch up with friends, pets, and catch a breath of fresh air. Like other Blue Bottle locations, the baristas are phenomenal."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Love this hidden coffee shop, Like their single-origin, it is new every month!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,After a week of weak and otherwise uninspiring American coffee it was great to find a place that knew how to make the classic Kiwi double/triple shot flat white! An awesome little place with baristas who really know their stuff!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Great coffee, long lines, and standard coffee snob barista service. It's a toss-upbetween here and Ritual around the corner. Blue Bottle has better coffee and slightly lower prices, where as Ritual has friendlier baristas and no line usually."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"One of the best coffee in San Francisco. The place is really small and difficult to find, just for a coffee to go, but you have some spaces for seating in front of the coffee shop, definitely a different place and a yummy coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"It's a little café located on a small street but the coffee and service is great! No sitting room, so just grab and go. Definitely worth trying their coffee if you're nearby"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,The coffee is great. The customer service was left to be desired. I get it's a hipster place but it doesn't mean you get to be a snob and act snappy because you can't count money
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I love blue bottle! This is a great little side street spot, but I wish there was a cleaner area to sit and hang out when you get your coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The wait is worth it if you're waiting with someone you don't mind spending downtime with. Go for the cappuccino, New Orleans iced coffee, or hot chocolate. The baked goods are decent, with the double chocolate cookie and the cigars as standouts."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"my friend told me this store is many people drink coffee. I ordered cafe late. this coffee is art on the top. it is different each person,I went to here with 4 people everyone different to art on the top. there are a lot of place in san francisco. golden gate park alamo square...you can try if you come to SF."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"God the coffee's so good, but so many tourists stop by making it crazily crowded. The baristas are sometimes super quick and other times, they appear to be working in slow motion. I don't blame them."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I don't get all the exitation about this place. The coffee is OK but you can find much better in SF. Moreover, it is just a hangar open on the street with the stocks fully visible and almost no decoration (it is original ? Not at all)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"This is a unique place, I like their service alot and the people are very friendly here. This place is a nice coffee area and the taste is quite different than going to any starbucks coffee so come here if you want a unique and made per your desire coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"If you want a genuine San Francisco experience, with Dogs, Young Scruffy BF's w/GF's, Mom's with little toddlers, come here. The best part is that it's outside and off the beaten path. There are many tucked away alleys in San Francisco that we all have walked bye and missed out on, This is one you are sure not to miss out on. Coffee at the end of the rainbow? I think yes!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I usually stop there before riding up to North Bay on my Ducati. The espresso ought to be called ""Motor Oil Exprezzo"" since it's so thick and yummy. It razzled me up and zipped up on Franklin, Lombard, Golden Gate Bridge, 101, and, finally, Highway One. Thanks goodness for their espresso, so thick so yummy with extreme bitterness. NOM!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The lines are increasingly long, but the iced coffee is unparalleled.  Edit: I now prefer to skip the line and support Eureka Cafe in the Castro - I can get the delicious iced coffee in a large size and have a loyalty card."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"As a tourist, I had nice coffee and wonderful people at this place."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,One of the establishments that made me wanna move to SF.. And so i did... First love of coffee and i'm still very fond of there products so manny years later.  Give them a try! it will wake you up!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I'll make this quick. If you like your coffee, go here! Blue Bottle Coffee know their coffee. Its very tasty! But be prepared to wait outside, as there maybe a line going around the block."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Each cup is hand brewed and crafted. One of the best cups of coffee around. It gets quite crowded and busy since this is a tiny little kiosk but it's worth the wait and the hassle.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Tiny and yummy, there’s often a line in the morning and when you order something special (for me it’s a double americano with a tiny bit of steamed almond milk) you appreciate when it’s well done. The baristas have a sense of humor, don’t order a “grande” or a “tall” 😂👌 …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Nice outdoor location.  Coffee good.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,An experience. I met up with an old friend here and I just loved the simplicity of this place. We grabbed coffee and then walked around. There is a bench across the street. Totally recommend!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"One point taken off as there is no filter coffee (only pour over) which is a hassle if you're in a rush. Other than that, super tasty and good pretzel croissant"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Love Blue Bottle Coffee! Although it’s not an official location. It’s more of a hole in a wall place. They don’t offer Affogato, but there is an ice cream place right near them and they will pour some espresso shots into your ice cream. They are nice and friendly! Their coffee is the best."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Such a fun tucked away location with the famous delicious Blue Bottle Coffee that everyone needs to try when they're in town. Pull up your GPS though, you'll need it to find this tucked away spot."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,the best coffee spot in SF hands down. Their coffee will get you crawling on the ceiling and so energized that it's not funny. a must visit when in SF!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Upscale hipster cafe where the baristas take coffee very seriously and craft every cup with care. Their drip coffee is heavy on the acidic side, but their espresso is perfect."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"One of my favorite coffee stops in Blue Bottle Coffee, especially when I stay in the neighborhood. Reliably delicious coffee, friendly staff and casual hangout area."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I went with my mom and a friend for coffee, they served a cold coffee and we asked if they could heat it up, after the third (cold) coffee we gave up and the guy who was serving the coffee laughed in our faces and refused to give us our money back after spending $17 . Terrible service."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Truly the best damn soy latte I've ever had. Ever. Velvet foam and perfect temperature. Only my first time tho, so we'll see if it sticks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Great little cafe tucked quaintly away in a garage. The beans are a bit more tart than I enjoy but I can at least appreciate the quality of their roast and the skill of the baristas.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,High end third wave coffee. Great service and advice.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Super busy, but well worth the wait. This coffee is absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere and delicious drinks. Pretty busy, but you'll see why."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I tried their cold brew and it was amazing! Like absolutely amazing but if you trying for the first time then please get the cafe latte or cafe mocha! Its what they are known for.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Cute little coffee store! the green tea latte is soooooo 👍 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"The 315 Linden location is the hole in the wall that started it all. Everything's good, as the long line suggests, but if you want to get hip with the drip it's best to know your barrista. Not all of them are equally skilled at the fine art of drip. BTW, the applies to Linden, the other locations have somewhat Starbuckisized their drip-making. Afterwards, you might enjoy Dark Garden next door."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I had a lovely experince at the Blue Bottle cafe. The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was even better. I would recommend this cafe to anyone. The lay out of the cafe is very customer friendly, and they offer free wifi"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Love that it is in a pop-up garage. Such a great venue and the coffee is fantastic. I always seem to end up ordering the new orleans iced coffee. So gooooood!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Great coffee shop, had a Latte girlfriend had a Mocha. Much better than starbucks.  If you are a coffee enthusiast this is a must try!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,SF's best coffee spot nestled into a re-vitalized alley way in Hayes Valley. The benchs across from it creates a little mini-park right outside the shop.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I really wonder why it's called Blue Bottle, but it's definitely true that the coffee here is quite good. It's become  chain around the city, but this location was one of the first and my personal favorite."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,The quality you expect from Blue Bottle is a cute little alleyway. Chill on one of the parklet benches made from reclaimed concrete and enjoy a well made Latte.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Awesome staff. Delicious pastries. The best cappuccino I've had in a long time.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Good coffee. Nice spot that gathers a good crowd.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Best coffee in town, yeah yeah you know.  Take a sip, start hallucinating, A Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe. Make a bald man grow, a ginger afro. Turn that frown to a smile, Robert Dinero. May even slow Aunt Flow. Substantial Bowel movement, time to go numero dos! Don't say, I didn't tell you so. Maybe a waffle for a buck fiddy, ""Waffle Machine still broken?"" Oh hells no! ""It been 3 months ho!""  Long lines for the grind, jog down a few feet to Plant cafe, they serve the same, dumbo! One way or another, Can't beat Blue bottle's cup a Joe.  shhh..  Cut the wait time in half, 9am, use the secret Door."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Blue bottle coffee is a MUST GO in SF. Not only is it delicious, it makes you feel amazing. I have on word to describe Blue Bottle: Obsessed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Great coffee and delicious chocolate sold as well. Served out of a house‘s garage, the staff is friendly and service was fast!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Absolute best lattes in the world! So smooth and creamy :)

Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,cool experience. nice taste.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I always get the iced mocha and it is always great! I love that they have compostable cups and lids too.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Probably the best overall coffee in the city (along with SIghtglass and 4-Barrel).  They make a good mocha, latte, americano and macchiato."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Massively overrated and expensive.  Coffee is mediocre at best. Latte was fit for an 8 year old whose mommy allows them to have their first drop of coffee in an ocean of poorly frothed milk.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"I visited this for the first time and ordered for my cappuccino. The coffee was really good. Also, the service was good.  I suggest people to visit this place for a good coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Fantastic coffee. This 3rd wave coffee shop takes it seriously and produces one if the best cups in the city.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"If you like java, this is the place to go for the best java. It's a place to come to chill and relax and get a cup of good java. The staff are always nice and friendly."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Horrible coffee prepared poorly. Cappuccino always had rough grounds of coffee making it impossible to drink. This company just sold its soul to Nestle. Avoid this place at all costs.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Very nice place, for coffee. Great for neighbor hood hang out with friends and co-workers. Try it and you will like it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Great little coffee shop operating out of a roll up garage door. Friendly staff and a couple of bricks on a sidewalk to sit on and soak in the sun while enjoying bb delicious coffee
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"this is the best espresso you can get in town, it taste so rich and sweet. it smells very good when you drink it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Fabulous Drink! I always go out with my friends and have a quality time here. Kudos to the staffs for their kind attitude.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Staple SF coffee. A must have, but there are very comparable coffee places nearby that was equally interesting. Good to try, but prefer some of the other SF coffee places."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Wonderful cappuccinos! Note that it's just a small coffee stand in a slightly sketchy area... good stuff though, good stuff."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Great coffee! A little bit expensive! But worth an occasional treat. Would go again for surr!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Great little spot. It used to feel like a hidden surprise. Now, it's feels much more obvious and busy but still a lovely spot for an afternoon treat."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"One of the best coffees in the city, hands down. Conveniently located at the Ferry building. Try some of the macarons of the place across with the coffee :)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Had a delicious latte. The staff were welcoming and made our coffee's quickly during a busy period.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"favorite coffee in the city.  there used to be iced coffee, but now they no longer serve this.  the replacement would be iced americano.  new orleans iced coffee is a bit sweeter"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Literal hole-in-the-wall coffee spot. Fantastic coffee and small selection of pastries. Perfect for a to-go coffee (no seating).
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Amazing, extra-ordinary coffee, very rare in US. Sometimes you have to stand in a long line but really worth it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"No place to sit. It's outside, served on the street."
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I love the clean look of Blue Bottle as much as the delicious drinks!  Make sure you get the iced coffee!! YUM!
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I love the Macchiato. Great coffee served from a little hole in the wall shop. Sit down on bollards outside the laneway and savor the coffee
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,I walked a long way in the pouring rain just to try this. It was totally worth it! The best coffee I had in SF
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Amazing coffee, fast service. Can't really complain about seating, as it's just a stall -- but if you take it for what it's meant to be, it's amazing."

Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,Really great coffee! Worth the trip if you are near by.

Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"Very nice hole-in-the-wall style shop. The New Orleans coffee is delicious, would recommend!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,It's a hole in the wall but their coffee is very good.  They unfortunately have limited supply of their coffee beans in stock.
Blue Bottle Coffee,315 Linden St,"WOW. I hadn't been back for 2 years and Zac remembered my name and my order, and made me the best damn coffee I've had in 2 years. Man I miss coming here."
