Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,Good sandwiches. Iv tried a few of them. Aside from the sandwiches being small for 15$ they are good.... just a little small for the price.
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"My go-to lunch item is the Chipotle Chicken salad. Their portions are large and seasoned perfectly. The owner and staff are friendly. The space feels small because there are always so many people ordering food. There's also a nice sitting area right next door, outside. I need to try more of the options on the menu. Also, I just did a last minute large order of avocado toast for my team. Most places require a 24-48hr notice. Great for a small business!"
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,Great variety of delicious sandwiches and salads. The owner is incredibly kind and makes a point to get to know the customers and ensure they have a good experience.
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Tried Working Girls Cafe for lunch and found that the California Melt sandwich (Turkey, bacon, avocado etc) was way better than the sandwiches from subway.  Will eat here more often and advise coworkers to check it out too."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Really great food, plenty of both unique and common options. Very fast and friendly service. While working in downtown San Fran, I've eaten there the last two days. I went with protein salads both days and they're perfect. Definitely try it if you want a great lunch and don't have a lot of time."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Went to Working Girls Cafe on Friday for the 1st time. They took my order during this pandemic and my food was ready for me when I got there. The gentleman working was so friendly and it was nice chatting with him. I had the Cajun Chicken Protein Bowl and it was excellent. Full of nicely spiced chicken, corn, black beans, kale, quinoa and some perks for people like me like tortilla strips, shredded cheese and a little sour cream. I’m positive that they’d be happy to modify if you’d like. I definitely recommend giving them a visit!"
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Nice menu, good food. We ate here three times during our SF trip. We are from the East Coast and sort-of expect breakfast places to be opened before 7AM so that was a little inconvenient at times but we liked the food enough to keep going back and making it work. The breakfast sandwiches are good, bread and bagels were fresh, but I felt it was a little pricey. Then again, it's located in a somewhat touristy area in an expensive city so I understand the pricing. The service was friendly and fast and there are a few tables towards the back to eat inside."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"I love this place in the middle of financial district!  Everything is reasonably priced, especially their coffee.  The owner is super nice so make sure to say hi if you stop by!  They brew their coffee fresh after you order so you can watch them as they make you a fresh cup of morning joe!  I do recommend the mocha latte if you have a sweet tooth as it is quite tasty.  Aside from their sandwiches, there’s plenty of donuts, brownies, pastries and bagels for snack or quick breakfast."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"I love this place. I get lunch for the office 2-3 times a month. I also go just for myself. The food is always delicious, it's ready on time, and the staff couldn't be nicer. Go show them some love."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"The sandwiches and salads here are great. It can get pretty packed and take a while around lunch time, but the wait is worth it. Reasonably priced to the other delis in the area and the owners are friendly.  Just a word of caution however. My sandwich was $7.50 and they gave me a cash receipt for $7.50, but charged my card $8.99. They did the same to the person in line behind me. I will ask them about it the next time I go in and will check my previous statements for similar behavior. I just wanted to mention it because it seemed intentional. And I even threw a buck in the tips."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Love the salads. Huge portion sizes, usually end up consuming it throughout the day. My favorite salad here is Mandarin Chicken Salad. Pretty tight.  The one con is that this place gets super busy during lunch hours and it usually takes 10-15 mins to get your food. Also, there's not a whole lot of seating space.  I wish these guys started doing online ordering via eat24, that way I could just do a pick up order and then walk and pick it up.  I've also had the good fortune of trying out the Albacore Tuna salad which is not as awesome as the Mandarin Chicken Salad."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,Working Girls is a wonderful cafe the Staff and Manager are wonderful and the food is great too. I have been eating there for over 14 years. So give it a try the Cobb Salad and Cobb Quinoa Bowl are excellent. A++.
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,Overload.  My favorite place for salad near work! The Chicken Chipotle Salad but this time dressing was overload. I couldn't even eat the last bit of it because it was soggy after all that dressing. I think the lady who made it was new because all the other workers (guys) were telling her what to do. I also ordered a chicken noodle soup and it was simple. I didn't expect much as chicken noodle soups are self-explanatory and tasty. This lunch wasn't great but it sure was overload for me. I seem to think the one in FiDi is better than this location... I'll be back when I'm craving for this salad. You must try it!
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Great family-owned sandwich shop. I love the chicken pesto sandwich. They also have salads, soups, pastries, an assortment of beverages, fresh fruits, and coffee. Conveniently located in downtown/SoMa, accessible via the MUNI 14 bus LINE and just a couple blocks from Embarcadero Station."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Delicious salads and protein bowls! Great Coffee, and very friendly and kind staff. I recommend this place."
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,Very nice place with friendly crew.  My favorite is prosciutto sandwich. Overall lines are very fast and food is very good to have for lunch.
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,Lunch favorite downtown. This place has been good for a couple decades now.
Working Girls' Cafe,101 Mission St,"Great sandwiches, pretty fast service.  staff was great and friendly.  good pricing. worth the stop."
