Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Just ate ate there! Its so absolutely wonderful and worth it! Incredible service, food and atmosphere! Genuinely the best meal I’ve had in a very long time! Most wonderful sandwich and welcoming environment! Me and my mother had the Tuna melt and the Chicken parm sandwich (the latter is pictured below)  The only thing I will say is the portion sizes are good but a bit larger for someone just visiting the USA. Wonderful meal, would highly suggest going!"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Really expensive and tasteless. We tried because of the reviews but the breakfast was tremendously disappointing. The grilled cheese should be called burned plastic, the cashier was in a bad mood, the croissant sandwich was terrible, and all super overpriced. Run!"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,They deliver excellent customer service. I’d say the best experience for dine-in at cafe in the US so far. I’m not the fan of burger and sandwich so I went with salmon scramble and fruit and the taste was marvellous!! The atmosphere is also comfy. I would definitely coming back to this place again when I visit SF.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Came here twice while chaperoning a student trip from Texas. Delicious food and amazing service! Definitely recommend. They were able to get more than 30 of us in and taken care of both deliciously and beautifully!
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Fast. Could be better with a full bar - love a Bloody Mary option :) Fresh squeeze juice right in front of me. Good coffee cake. I got the pancake combo. And although it’s s’posed to come with scrambled eggs, he let me modify to over medium. The latte was great, and served in a huge heavy mug - perfect alternative to the tiny cups or worst paper cups most places do these days.  Also, obsessed with the accuracy of ChatGPT. I asked to write a review for this place - super true: Mo'z Cafe is a cozy and charming breakfast and brunch spot located in the heart of San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood. The cafe has a warm and inviting atmosphere with a decor that exudes a chic and contemporary feel.  The menu at Mo'z Cafe offers a wide selection of breakfast and brunch items, including classic favorites like pancakes, French toast, and eggs Benedict, as well as more unique dishes like the ""Breakfast Sushi,"" which is a creative take on eggs and bacon presented in a sushi roll. All of the dishes are made with high-quality ingredients and are beautifully presented.  I particularly enjoyed the avocado toast, which was topped with perfectly ripe avocado, cherry tomatoes, and feta cheese, and served on a slice of artisanal bread. The coffee at Mo'z Cafe is also excellent, with a range of blends and brewing methods to choose from.  The service at Mo'z Cafe is friendly and attentive, with staff who are knowledgeable about the menu and happy to offer recommendations. The cafe can get quite busy during peak hours, but the wait times are usually reasonable, and it's worth it for the delicious food and cozy ambiance.  Overall, I highly recommend Mo'z Cafe for a relaxed and delicious breakfast or brunch experience in San Francisco. It's a great spot to enjoy a leisurely meal with friends or family, or to catch up on work while sipping a cup of coffee and enjoying a delicious meal."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"I loved their new burrito bowl. It made for a great breakfast filled with greens, beans, rice, and salsa. The coffee was awesome too. The perfect place to dine on your way to your flight out of SF."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Absolutely delicious food. And the owner is incredibly friendly and kind. We brought a huge group of students and he served them so quickly! Would definitely come again to try everything on the menu!
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Best of the best .Big portions excellent food . I had a breakfast the pancakes was so fluffy. And the service 10/10 thanks a lot to Mohamed.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Was so underwhelming! I had the beef hash! It was all potatoes and a hint of beef for $20. I even asked the guy if the amount of protein was sufficient and he said it is plenty and excellent. Typical American style. Loaded with carbs and little nutritious value.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Fantastic food served hot and fresh. Got the corned beef hash and eggs and it's every bit as good as it looks.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Very nice breakfast place.  Service was wonderful. I had the the Fruity Nutella Crepe and my husband had oatmeal. Also got 2 smoothies. Lots of chopped ice so not really a smoothie- but tasty. My husband said the coffee was great.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Great breakfast close to my hotel. - There's a little bit of everything here but the coffee is good, food tastes fresh and good, and the environment is nice."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"I recently had a layover in San Francisco while traveling from Hawaii to Europe, and the stars aligned to bring me to Mo'z Cafe for a scrumptious brunch! Let me tell ya, it was a delightful gastronomic pit stop on my journey.  This cafe radiates good vibes all around, with its chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and mouthwatering menu. Though the queue was long, it only spoke volumes of the love people have for this gem of a place. No one minds waiting for something this amazing!  The food was simply divine, with each bite transporting me to brunch paradise. I could tell every dish was crafted with care, making it the perfect fuel for a long flight ahead. Mo'z Cafe is the embodiment of what brunch dreams are made of.  If you ever find yourself in San Francisco, don't miss out on this brunch haven. Trust me, it's worth every second of the wait! Can't wait for my next layover to indulge in the magic of Mo'z Cafe again. ✌️🥞🥓☕️🌉"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Cute cafe in the middle of the city. Plenty of breakfast selection and friendly wait staff. Their corned beef hash is not bad. It has carrots which were a little off-putting, otherwise it was pretty decent. Note that it does say it in the menu item's description. Their regular iced coffee is decent as well. Wouldn't mind checking out their other menu items."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"This café embodies all the things I love. Salmon lox bagels, chocolate croissants, great coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice… Everything under one small roof and beautifully done. Excellent service and wonderful smiles."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Customer service needs serious work. We were one of two couples dining on the morning and they managed to bring out juice that we didn’t order, then came over to make us pay for the difference instead of owning their mistake. I’ve worked in many restaurants and I’ve never seen them nickel and dime customers like this. It’s not a good look. Should have just gotten breakfast at the airport, it would have been a lot cheaper anyway 👎"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"The breakfast burrito was very filling, I couldn't finish it! Coffee is really good and they have good brown cane sugar as well. I don't like that plates and cutlery are disposable plastics, but everything else was great!"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"This is our new favorite breakfast spot in the city. I recommend the eggs Florentine. It's small and a little quirky, just what you would expect in San Francisco."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Great place for breakfast. Love the interior. Great quality food, drinks and unique choice! Great service."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Great place to grub breakfast, service is excellent, food is also good"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Ate here a few times. Excellent breakfast place. Good coffee.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"A lot of care goes into the food at Mo'z. The salmon scramble is amazing and even the coffee was wonderful. The service is fast and friendly, and it's just a relaxing place to start your day. Close to all the hotels around Union Square."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Doesn't seem much. But the less the better right? Mo'z Pancake Combo special with a ice coffee , defently coming back! Super tasty and excelent for breakfest and brunch. Great prices! Filling dishes! The pancake was super fluffy and tasty, the sausage was a bit stiff but still tasty and for sure the dish is fulfiling. I think that some normal utensiles as knife and fork could be more comfy but still everything was great😁"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Love this place. My wife and I ordered the breakfast burrito and the croissant sandwich. The burrito has the right amount of jalapeno heat and my wife said she enjoyed the breakfast ham and cheese croissant. For the kids we ordered the Moz pancake combo with extra sausage. We split it between them and the portion was more than enough. They loved the pancakes. Fluffy and lightly sweet. It was their favorite meal of the vacation. Met the owner and he was so nice and accommodating. He came out and opened the door so we could get the stroller in. He checked on us multiple times. You can tell he cares about his business and wants it to thrive. Please come support this cafe.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"After wondering a lot and getting frustrated fr all the closed restaurants everywhere (very sad actually) I found this place, nice and clean, with a big veraiety of foods, only thing botherede was the price for my salad - 19$, it was a large dish I have to admit though"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Excellent breakfast. I was on a limited diet and they cooked up eggs just to meet my requirements. Big smiles and happy to have us in the restaurant. The restroom was clean and everything felt just really like a nice place to be.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Loved this place! The staff was so friendly and treated us like family. My husband and I shared these two meals pictured below. Everything was delicious and we already can’t wait to come back!
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,They do a decent breakfast and cafe au lait. Friendly staff and quiet dine-in if one arrives early.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,I was poisoned at approximately 11:25 am today deliberately by the cook and staff.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,The food is ok but the presentation on paper plate and plastic cutlery to eat is very disappointing. And the price really crazy $70.00 for 2 burrito a sausage and two large coffee.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Wow! Always look for a place other than the hotel I'm in. What a fine fit breakfast. I can only imagine what the sandwiches are like. Mo'z pancake combo and eggs bene were prefect! Fruity Nutella crepes finished off and awesome breakfast...got it to go. A berry blast w/acai🙄 to walk out down. Sorry no close up picture of the sticky bun and chocolate croissant only the case (top 2nd from rt/bottom left) at I ate them there. Get them!  Day 2 French toast, berry blast, sticky bun and fruity Nutella crepes"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"My favorite breakfast spot in SF. The bagels are delicious, crunchy, slightly chewy, and bite perfectly. The consistency of the food is top notch - it’s always delicious. The owner works there every day and you can tell he really loves the the place.  He is genuinely friendly and welcoming, and his attitude and tasty food make a great start to the day for anyone who stops by."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"The best!  The food was fantastic.  The menu is huge!  If I ate here every day for. Month, I think I'd still have things to try."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Breakfast burrito was alright, it lacked flavor, and meat, I definitely wouldn’t recommend for $20. Should have been $12 max. Beans were good. Staff was very friendly. If I ever came here again I would try something else. Overpriced here but so is all of SF."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,It was pretty expensive and mediocre food. My husband and I didn't like what we got. Pancakes were a bit like rubber. But they offer plenty of different breakfast specials. Maybe other food is better.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,We were looking for some cafe to eat but found this. We entered into this clean place. The service was the best part because the food was served quick and when I asked to warm my drink he made it perfectly hot. The menu items were filled up. It was a great experience overall.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,Went here for breakfast. Thought the food was overpriced for what you got. Ordered the French toast and it only came with 4 half slices and was $20. No sides included. Not worth the cost. Had a way better breakfast at Lapisara.
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"This place is amazing!!!  Here on business, walked in, staff was freaking awesome!  Fresh squeezed OJ, healthy food...if you travel for business, you understand how much I appreciated this restaurant.   Please give the place your business!"
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"One of the best places to eat, breakfast, brunch and lunch. Everything is good, I really enjoy the corned beef hash. With a Thai Iced tea. 10/10 will be coming back."
Mo'z Cafe,36 5th St,"Quaint atmosphere, friendly fast service and good quality food  really can’t ask for much more. The screwdriver was made with freshly squeezed orange juice which was a very nice touch."
