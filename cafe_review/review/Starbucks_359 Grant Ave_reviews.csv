Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Quick service and very friendly. But why in the world don’t you have chairs for your patrons? After walking miles and miles up and down the city, wouldn’t it be nice to offer chairs and tables for your customers to sit back and enjoy their coffee? Please where are the chairs?"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Came in here to take a minute to relax before leaving to the airport after a week long trip. Loudest EDM music playing and no chairs or tables inside. We really tried not to go to Starbucks while on this trip as to support local cafes but by 3:00 on Saturday most of the cafes in the area (including the Starbucks down the street) are closed. The barista was rude and the store had unbearably loud music. Confused as to why they don’t offer seating as well, never been to a Starbucks with 0 chairs in my life."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"We came in a few times while visiting town. Quick, friendly service! Recommend coffee cake and vanilla latte"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Barista was nice, the drinks were made well by her and the atmosphere was nice."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Coffee was on point but was given the name ""Jennifer"" even after they asked for my name. No seating at this location and all merchandise is locked up."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Nice coffee shop, but the name of the shop is relatively small."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,Nice and clean. Also friendly staff and lovely jazz music 🎶👍🇺🇸. …
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Even if you buy something they don't let you use their bathroom,  they lie and say they don't have one, only to find that it's marked as ""storage room"" under code lock.  very rude"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,The drinks were made well and the atmosphere is nice. Good choice of music. Most importantly though I’d like to praise the worker Hirosan. He was so kind and gave my friend and I a cake pop and apologized when cleaning by us. He deserves a raise and he made my day! Thank you Hirosan.
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Love it. Very friendly staff. And my order in time and the most important, the way I like it. Thank you for your service"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,They won’t provide restroom to customer. Bad service .
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"It’s a quintessential Starbucks, but it’s much better at coffee than the French restaurant across the street (if you can even call that place french). My only complaint is that I wish more of the baristas knew Mandarin Chinese based on this store’s location."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Nice Starbucks, friendly staff, Quick Service."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"It's located at a very busy interaction, therefore is crowded most of the day. Even though it is busy, there staffs are always friendly and smile"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HELLA NICE! Some of the nicest baristas I've ever met. But I've ordered hot cocoa from here and it's like a 60/40 chance it's going to be made wrong. When it is made properly it's the best damn cup of hot cocoa I've ever had. When it's made wrong it tastes like mocha or coffee? Is mocha coffee? Anyways it's been made wrong about five or six times. I'm writing this review after getting my hot cocoa and finding out it doesn't taste anything like it.
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,Order coffee and got my order wrong and wouldn't make me the right one. Very rude and unhelpful starbucks. Go to other starbucks not this location.
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"I spread my love for coffee with different coffee places, but every single time that I go to the grant & bush Starbucks my whole experience is A+"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Friendly, fast, and relatively clean.  Located opposite the Chinatown gate."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,Good customer service. Very nice people.
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"The reason is simple. We came and order coffee and we were the only people here.  Then people came after, and they start serving together customers first before our order.  😂😂🤔 I was wondering why. The server was friends with the customers after us. Something ridiculous.  Maybe in should make friends with business to have VIP service. 😂😂😂 they should have a talk with this people. Customer service first, friends later. Plus dont said anything in another language. We understand."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"great climate, and this location... :)"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Small place with lots of people, though feels a bit congested but different coffee flavors to try out."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"This is the BEST Starbucks I've ever been to. I'm not sure why but I think it's the manager, the tall lady. I don't know her name. But the staff is very polite and positive, and they always get the order right."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Nothing beats having a fresh cup of Starbucks coffee in the morning. They have a wide range of beverages, hot and cold, that are freshly made. They also have small pastries to go with if needed. The service is relatively fast and the employers are very nice to talk to. Although the price may not be so affordable, it is definitely worth the money."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Worst Starbucks I've ever been too! The staff was rude and didn't appear to want to be there. Granted, it was busy, but there is no excuse for lack of customer service. On top of that, they closed the bathrooms for no apparent reason. I could understand if they wouldn't allow non-customers to use the restroom, but why would you close them to paying customers? Since we didn't get in line before they stopped allowing customers to use it (we weren't ready to leave yet and there was no warning or indication they were going to close them) , we couldn't use it. This is ridiculous! Never will I go to this Starbucks again."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"After me and my Mom got a drink from Starbucks, we stopped outside of Starbucks waited uber car for less than 2 min, it was raining! Then a very rude women yelled on us and said”I’m the manger here go inside remove your things from here” she doesn’t look like a respected women how come she is a manager in this known place?!!! She didn’t say please and has totally inappropriate way of talking.."
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Normally I like Starbucks but this one in CDG terminal 2  had very little seating area and it (ice milk coffee) tasted funny. I didn't get sick, though. Also could not use the Starbucks app here, which would have been especially convenient at this location :("
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"I don’t normally review places as mundane as Starbucks, but I was inspired to write this after seeing barista Chris in-action yesterday. A shy little girl came in asking for an “off the menu” drink and the Chris worked with her to follow the recipe she found online so that the team could make the special drink for her. Not only did he go out of his way, but he did so with a smile & was super jovial about the whole thing when he could have easily just have said “nah, that drink’s going to take too much time to make.”  Great customer service!"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,Got a 70% full hot chocolate. And they don’t have a restroom…
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,This Grant Avenue Starbucks near the Chinatown Gate is a tad small with limited seating - typically frequented by tourists.  Most of the staff are super friendly and helpful but a few (unsure if new and/or under training) have caused a few custom drink mishaps.  Not a sit-down type of place but OK for takeout.
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Java Chip Chocolate just tasted like coffee. At other Starbucks I love the Java Chip Chocolate Frappucino, but here it was horrible. But after I asked friendly 2 times, they made me a new one which tastes like the normal one"
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,Great customer service
Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"Much shorter lines than other nearby locations, but its close proximity to Chinatown leads to some less-than-savory characters coming in to bum the free wi-fi (which reduces the already limited seating options)."

Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,Customer service with mean girls vibes.

Starbucks,359 Grant Ave,"I ordered cappuccino and I know it has foam but for having ordered a Venti and they give me practically a boy when all the foam disappears, I think it's abuse. I told the barista and her response was, well, is it cappuccino, do you know what it is? 🙄  Time shopping at different starbucks and I have never been served such a simple drink.  I do not recommend it, walk a few more meters and look for another place."
