Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Blue Bottle Coffee on Fillmore street is in the top 5 Blue Bottle Coffee shops I’ve been to (I bet the cafes in Palo Alto, Mission Bay & South Bay would want to know if they’ve made the top 5 list).  The most beautiful thing about a coffee shop is the community that spontaneously gets built over a cup of coffee & I believe that is something so special that this coffee shop has been able to do, at the location it’s at.  What I love most about Blue Bottle Coffee is how they have somehow stuck strong to their tradition of coffee engineering. A lot of larger chain coffee shops easily lose their core mission, in Chase of revenue. BBCoffee has stuck strong to brewing great coffee.  What I love most about all the BBCoffee locations is how they have simple interiors using plain colors like white, a dash of blue and plain table & chairs. That makes their spaces quite big and lit up, which has some positive effect on people & their mental comfort. The simplicity of their spaces + intriguing notes of their coffees, makes the place a must visit."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Ok, I'm a fan of Blue Bottle. Love the coffee from the early days. I don't want to complain again, but it can only help improve the retail experience.  We need simple syrup. Cold drinks and granulated sugar don't mix. And please provide just napkins. Not packaged compostable cutlery with a single napkin. A lot of waste to wipe up a mess made stirring the sugar in.  But oh the Gibraltar, made perfectly by a couple of empowered women. Thanks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Coffee is expensive but it is really good. Rating 4 stars because it's also not a great place to sit and work for a few hours so it's not a ""5 star coffee shop"" in that sense. The wifi is extremely slow and there is only 1 table that has a power outlet. Peet's down the street is an overall better experience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I ordered to pick up, maybe they knew that customers don’t usually check their food. I got home and had only half of a waffle. Be sure to check your order before leaving"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Had a pleasant visit while on a stroll in San Francisco. Great stuff. First time I tried it out after seeing locations all over the place. The menu is simple and the recommendation I got from the barista was the Shakerato, which turned out pretty good. Not too expensive either."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Yes, I hear you that BBC isn't buying local and there are plenty of wonderful coffee shops (see Home Roasted Coffee SF),but BBC's Black Cardamom Latte is hard to beat. Just say'n. The delivery was top shelf and you can smell the Cardamom and Coffee aroma as you sip. Yes please."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"The worst experience ever. I always loved blue bottle and was a loyal client for many years. But never again. Last week I waited for 30 minutes for my coffee to find out that there were still 6 people in front of me. I left without my coffee cause I wasn’t ready to wait for an hour to finally get it. Obviously I never got my money back. In addition lady in front of me stole a coffee beans. If you are ok with getting your coffee in 1-2 hours, this is a place for you."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Was told there was a 5 minute wait for a new batch of drip coffee. Ended up waiting over 10 minutes. Nice seating area and coffee is rich in taste. Probably would not go back though
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Great, fast service. Coffee is delicious, specifically the cardamom latte. Absurdly over priced but they're famous so I get it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I would say Blue Bottle is one of the best Coffee spots you can go to for great quality coffee. Something about the way they prep their beans, filtered water and machines just develops a better product."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Visited blue bottle during our vacay in SFO. The staff is well knowledge with various types of coffee beans and able to give recommendations. A good cup of coffee to start the day!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Very expensive (5.98 before tip) for a cup of chain quality coffee. Would recommend just going to Compton's (nicer quality with less price) nearby.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,I love their coffee and waffles so much! Will definitely come back whenever visiting SF.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Very nice coffee with amazing aroma ☕️
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Loved this Blue Bottle cafe. Good coffee, great avocado toast. Highly recommended as usual!🥑✌🏼"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,This Fillmore Street location has a lot of foot traffic and can get noisy -- it's generally not suitable for a low-key meeting. If you're looking for a quiet place to sit and drink your coffee try the park nearby.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,It is just ok. Hot Nola is sooo sweet. cannot stand it as a non-American.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Unworkably slow wifi - not a great place to work. The coffee is good but not sure how it is possible to have wifi this bad in 2023 in SF!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Possibly the best coffee I’ve tried compared to others nearby. Great atmosphere too!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Morning coffee.  He had the Mocha. Probably the best mocha I've ever had! I had the winter espresso. It was good with cream and sugar 😂. Barista were friendly and quick. The one that took our order was patient and explained the options without making me feel rushed. Ambiance is nice, not too loud and not to quiet. Would go here again."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Loved the coffee!! I had Black Cardamom Latte, good for those who don't mind cardamom taste. My husband had a regular Cappuccino and loved it. Pastries are good too."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"No issues with service or coffee (except long lines but hey it's SF!) Just a friendly suggestion is to replace these cheap and terrible dog treats with some organic and whole food dog treats. These are actually TOXIC for your pups but not many dog owners know it. Try Stella & Chewy, or any dry frozen dog treats.  I believe it wouldn't be that expensive given the price point of your coffee. Thank you!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I am really passionate about coffee and I have had good past experiences in blue bottles franchise in other states. In this one, I spent $8 for a tiny latte that had terrible taste. Would be great to have a price that make sense to the price."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"The affogato they have is excellent. The pairing of the brown butter ice cream from salt and straw with their espresso was perfect. I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine and get headaches quickly, but boy was it worth it. I scarfed this down real fast!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Knowledgeable staff and great coffee to match! Great location and stellar vibe inside.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Delicious cappuccinos with creamy oat milk. Their toasts are delicious and will get you through your morning. The place is quite big for a coffee shop and clean. They have kind staff and can get quite busy. Solid coffee every time.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Some of the best coffee around. Honestly, don't bother going to Starbucks when you've got this nearby. I level the extra additions they have in their store like free pins and little cookies for your doggo"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,One of the best coffee shops. Try it!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Over ten minutes to get a double expresso. Service is very slow and be unfriendly.  Very slow brewing indeed! No wonder why everybody goes to Starbucks these days!! So sad for the neighbourhood!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Fabulous place with good selection for coffee….tried the iced Nola with oat milk and it hit all the right spots 🙃. Also tried vegan overnight oats and olive twist. Do give them a try 👍🏻 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I found the staff unresponsive to my requests to customize my coffee order.  I had a asked for a latte to enjoy at the location in a a regular ceramic mug along with adding less milk (8oz). When my coffees were ready, they were in paper cups and the request for less milk wasn’t adhered to. Both staff at the check out counter and the barista were unhelpful when I pointed out my order wasn’t right.  After this Experince I’m not in a hurry to return to blue bottle."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Love blue bottle! I’m not even a coffee drinker, and I love their cold brew. Also- waffles are a must-try."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"The place is nice, but the espresso is terrible. Not sure if it is due to the machine, the barista or the coffee in itself. Anyway, the worst espresso ever ."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great cappuccino using the Hayes Valley Espresso coffee beans!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great coffee; delicious sweets; amazing staff!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Got a hot matcha latte for $6. Didn't really taste like matcha though, more like green milk tea if you know the difference. It seemed like they premix the matcha before hand and then add milk when people order instead of making it fresh. Wifi is also very slow and spotty. Only one outlet at the left wall where the high table/chairs were so a bit uncomfortable. Very aesthetic place and decent food though."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Coffee and avocado toast was good (but expensive). Not a place to spend any time. Crowded and uncomfortable. WiFi stinks.  Simply not worth it unless you are getting coffee to go.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,The croissant was fine but not worth the price. Not very crispy and could be more buttery. Coffee was good but costs too much even for city standards.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,TLDR Not a good place to chat/study/read/work anymore. Jane is doing the same fyi (no laptops allowed and 45 minute sitting policy). Wish more cafes were study-friendly given all the colleges/schools in the area.  Y’all I’m not sure what’s going on with this blue bottle but I came to grab a coffee with a friend and chat/read/work for a smidge and they had turned the Wi-Fi off and were blasting the weirdest global techno playlist I’ve ever heard in a coffee shop at 12 on a Tuesday. The shop was basically empty (no one sitting and working) so I think their tactic of getting people gone is working.  Also $6 peppermint tea- which I’m usually fine with since I typically stay and read for an hour. Nooo more business from me and my friend though. I’ll get my grab and go from peets and go sit in the park from now on.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great location! Cozy atmosphere and nice stuff. Blue bottle coffee is always good.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Best experience at a coffee shop I’ve ever had. Bought a stagg ekg from here and it happened to be used for some reason and they were super kind and helpful with the return. Black cardamom latte is my fave drink here.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I always liked blue bottle until today. I went into the location on Fillmore and ordered an espresso. Now every coffee shop and Cafe I have been into give you a double shot, it's mandatory.  But when I ordered here they gave me a single shot.  I asked 'is this a double shot' at first she said no. That I have to ask for it at the counter. Really, so they are going to charge me an extra $1 for a couple more table tablespoons of water. I told her that I thought a double shot was mandatory. Everywhere I go it is.  Then she changes the story and says their machines put out small shots, so it is considered a double.  It sure was very acidic like a single.   I hate to say it, but I would rather go to Starbucks. Then go back to blue bottle.  The only reason I gave it 2* instead of 1* is because the coffee is not bad"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Extremely mean stuff , I got negative compliment towards me from barista"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Nice Cafe.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Continues to be the best coffee in the Bay.  Food was great, too, but the excellent coffee makes this place a must-stop whenever I'm near SF"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Beautiful design and very friendly!!!  I did not like the quality of the coffee
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I left a review of Blue Bottle yesterday .  Apparently,  it was taken down, so allow me to restate what happened to me there a couple of weeks.  I placed an order for a coffee with ice cream .  The rude cashier preceded to tell me that they only accept credit cards as I was about to hand him cash.  Afterwards, I gave him my credit card.  He appeared shocked that I had a credit card  because I believe I am African American.   I know what I experienced.  I complained to the manager who listened and said I would receive a refund and gave me a card for a free coffee.  I don't think I will use it.  I will never go back there again. Also, my coffee with ice cream tasted horrible. The way in which  ALL customers are treated matters and that includes BLACK customers."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Never heard of this place before the coronavirus era. Seeing the barred entrance, they are quite protective with their inside which is very good for modern health but with a bad side of an unwelcoming feeling. My coffee break was too late for coffee but I have had better croissant rolls. I like the happy welcoming staff."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I’m in the bussines coffee for more then 4 years And I live in Asia!  I try your coffee .,but it’s taste so so normal and is looks like the barista just learn to make a latte art just yesterday ! I have learn just 2 months a go to make latte art and I think I can do it better then 95% from your employee.. For such a brand ...,I was so surprised that they didn’t pay attention on the presentation , taste of the coffee you sale it !!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Delicious coffee! I was impressed to see that they use bottomless portafilters! And with such a quick and precise pull every time.  The location and space is also very nice here. A great place to people watch, sit, and talk. I also noticed more than one business meeting / interview happening here.. so it seems like a great place to do that, too!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Always dependable Blue Bottle has amazing espresso-based coffee goodies.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Coffee good.  Wait time is always a bit slow.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"We love the Blue Bottle on Fillmore. Their Liege waffles, hot chocolate and cappuccino are delicious. And the team that works there is terrific: friendly, responsive and really get to know you."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Even after redoing the cappuccino for a 2nd time comes without the extras shots. Very disappointing for a $11.25 cappuccino!
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Absolutely delicious lattes - this latest Blu Bottle location stays true to the high quality standards of the brilliant chain. The lemon poppy seed cake I tried was delicious too - perfectly moist. The place has a very clean and modern look. Lots of light coming in from large windows.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Best coffee in SF and that’s saying something.  Service was poor - couldn’t get anyone to check on our order.  Order pickup is very slow… takes an extra 20 minutes if you order waffles so beware.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Oddly, prices have recently gone up while coffee  craft/quality has gone down (in last visit alone the barista was blowing on pour overs to cool them, moment's notice is markedly bland, less availability of the usually classics/hits [e.g., three africas blend], dish towel[?] was being used to clean waffle iron). I want to love this location. I hope  to revisit down the line."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,You mean NESTLE'S Blue Bottle. Good expensive coffee in an overly precious minimalist box. Don't ask for a cup of coffee.  They only have pour-over that you have to wait for.  Barristas can be a bit too cool for their own good. I guess it's a step up from Starbucks. Another giant chain destroys a nice local one.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Have had awesome blue bottle experiences, and this was not one of them. Barista’s weren’t very friendly, my pastry was dry, coffee was over extracted and the espresso pulled in 40+ seconds (heard a barista yell that across the shop to another barista).  Hope to have a better experience my next time through, but this time was incredibly disappointing."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Wow this coffee is liquid gold.... this specific location blows all other locations out of the water!! The new management took this place and turned it into my favorite atmosphere. Thank you blue bottle, my son LOVESS the pastries and waffles."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Officially the most expensive Almond Milk Latte in SF:  $6 ($5 for a Latte + a whole extra $ for almond milk.  Oh, and a small serving of oatmeal is $7.)  Seriously???  On principle, I couldn't get myself to pay that much, even in SF.  Better go to Joe and The Juice where they offer 3 types of vegan milks with no extra charge (all in under $5).  They told me they understand that many customers prefer or can only take non-dairy milk.  They're so right.  And Joe's lattes are delicious!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Since we are practicing social distance, I tried to order coffee online but the website is not working. So I went to order in person, the signs for pick up and order were extremely confusing. The staff doesn’t seems to care at all, I tell him the issue line is not clear and very confused. All he asked is “did you wait for a long” more than 3times, not really sure what kind of question was that and will helped the issue."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,yummy coffee place I usually get their shakerato with oak milk.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I know it's Halloween weekend, and we have all been hungover at work before. However, it was really evident today at Fillmore Blue Bottle. Attitude and service seemed way off."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"The coffee selection is excellent but the Cascara Fizz is awesome. On a hot day, I need two orders because one is not enough. The mini maple pecan blodie is also a favorite of mine."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"There's something about their fresh ground drip coffee that makes it my favorite coffee amongst all the other SF chains. Quite pricey at almost $5 for a simple coffee, but hey that's San Francisco for you."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I always enjoy a cup of coffee from Blue Bottle. I was, however, a little surprised that it was an extra dollar for the single origin espresso, and after tax and tip I ended up paying $6 for my espresso, which seems a bit extravagant and pricey."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"It’s a Blue Bottle. Much like any other Blue Bottle, meaning they’re too proud to allow you to buy an Americano (espressos and cappuccinos no problem though), too self-righteous to offer cardboard sleeves (which you’ll need to avoid burning your fingers while drinking an overpriced drip coffee), and too unhelpful to double-cup their coffees unless you go back and ask them for an extra cup (and you might need an extra two. Make no mistake, you will burn your fingers with the drinks as-served). But hey, want to feel like you’ve made it into the coffee snob club? Be my guest."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"When in San Fran this is our go to coffee shop. We started our day a Blue Bottle almost every day. The coffee got me through the day without giving me the jitters. We also had a delicious Belgium waffle that was buttery, soft & savory."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Feels like everytime I go they don’t have the food I want because they just ran out. How hard is it to keep up with food orders. Twice out of waffles. Once out of oatmeal. Get some better processes or management. Also get a grinder so I can buy coffee beans and have them ground by you.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Pricey, but expected given the location. Really good coffee. Stopped in a few times prior to COVID and the quality was consistently high. Pre-COVID it was a decent place to bunker down and get some work done."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great espresso. I'm from Seattle and am still trying to understand California's obsession with toast and just throwing random ingredients in bowls. That's their menu. Have fun.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"I did not like the taste of the coffee for a small cup of weird, small, mediocre brew. The staff were busy talking about their own private interests. There is not a variety in the type of sweetners and as i am diabetic, i usually get stevia or monkfruit. No 39 foot ceiling beans. Well, it was sold to a huge corpration. They now have the money to serve up disappointing mediocre and miserable arabica at an above average price point. Best to avoid this unappealing selection of coffee and go down the hill to Peet's coffee on sacramento st. And fillmore."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Relaxing, really good coffee and nice ppl."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Awesome place awesome staff good coffee! Location is perfect no complaints
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"No outlets to plug in laptops and no WiFi. Temperature of space is too cold. Almost seems intentional they’re trying to get you to not hang out. Blue Bottle locations in NYC don’t have these issues, so it must be a local phenomenon."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Always great tasting coffee, vegan milk options, nice baked things to go with your coffee. Love the place and Blue Bottle coffee in general"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Great coffee, even after being bought out. Decor is good, staff friendly and competent, and offerings great. Definitely recommend if you are in SF"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Showed up at 6:40 on a Saturday to buy beans to bring back with me to Colorado and the doors were locked. Three employees were inside and didn't acknowledge us. I guess you should just close at 6:30 anyways if you won't let customers in during open hours.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great vegan cappuccino
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Great coffee, lovely staff, good looking people around, but...no wifi! I came here to work on my laptop, am on business from out of town, walked over here, and now have to go somewhere else. Not cool"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Corner cafe with minimalistic interior design.  Very clean and friendly staff.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,soooooo expensive!!!! cappuccino was >$5 (!!!!!!!) yet just okay.  go to St Franks on Polk for a better cup. otherwise the cafe is a pleasant place to sit and work or have a meeting.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Good coffee. Unhappy employees
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great location. Typical Blue Bottle. Expect great bar drinks and drips. Staff are friendly and prompt and because it isn't downtown there are plenty of seats.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"One of my favorite coffee spots in the whole Bay Area. Awesome people, insane coffee and super tasty European style waffles and toasts."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"One of the few coffee shops in San Francisco that has an area to sit and bathrooms in the times of covid. And or course- phenomenal coffee, food, and service."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,This time I tried the new Stone-millednmatcha hot latte.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great coffee in a minimal setting. Love it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Love their coffee! Wet use their espresso beans daily. Fresh and full of flavor.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Coffee was average, food wasn't too great and definitely expensive for the portion sizes.  Like others have said, there's no wifi or outlets.  100% not coming back."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Coffee is great quality as always. Location is great but the indoors so cold (both temperature and cosiness/ style) I'm not sure I'll be back.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,If you like Blue Bottle. This is a what you like.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Nice having choices and competition for Starbucks. Benefits to us consumers as they all compete to provide quality products and great service
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Always great coffee here. Can't afford the $9 avocado toast but the waffle and pecan blondies are reasonable and delicious.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Their Hayes Valley espresso is served as a ristretto with pronounced bitterness and caramel.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,A little pricey but their coffee and pastries are outstanding.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Coffee is okay for what it is...friendly and helpful staff...pastries a little different from other made to order coffee places...prices are as expected and certainly not unique.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great coffee over price but great. The place has no wifi and the windows have no shade so during the day too much light
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"The contemporary setting, the open space and coffee to match my taste. Love to go there whenever we're in the city!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Great place to eat, everybody is so nice, I stopped there for the first time and when I told them they offered a coffee on the house so I can try it I reccomend it alot"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Coffee is good like other locations but longer wait with less people than other locations i've been to 🤷‍♀️ …
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Really good coffee, one size, (medium)  really expensive!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,New Orleans style iced coffee was perfect- not too sweet perfect for a hot day !
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Delicious coffee, great service,  beautiful interior.  Not a quick stop for coffee, and not an inexpensive spot either, but very nice."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"On a Saturday morning this place is buzzing! It's a fun, modern, lively neighborhood coffee shop with great coffee and very good waffles!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Great coffee and nice staff. The acoustics in the place make chatter and music just merge into one loud mess though.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Yummy. The staff is knowledgeable and the coffee is delicious. Love the airy and relaxed ambiance.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Aewesome the best coffee I’ve ever had ! Please open one In Miami again they should have never closed them :(
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Terrible! The coffee was bitter, thin, and nearly tasteless I left most of it. And it's expensive.  Sorry to say but I'm disappointed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Awesome new location. Big compared to the the other SF locations. Nice place to sit down, relax and have a cup of coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"It's ok coffee, but... I could bake a cake while they make it. It's really hard to understand how you make ""espresso"" that slowly."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Amazing very smooth nitro coffee.. first time here
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Better than mainstream big coffee companies. Worth the visit if you're in the area.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Good strong coffee! Just got a basic drip coffee with almond milk.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"Delicious coffee. Don't put anything in it, just give it a shot black and let the flavor come through!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,The yuzu lemon fizz is refreshing apart from all the great coffee and hot chocolate they have
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,"No frappacinos or PSL's here. Just really, really good coffee. The cold brew is 👌. …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,Better than Starbucks
Blue Bottle Coffee,2453 Fillmore St,The lemon Yuzu fizz is actually really nice! Like a tart lemonade.
