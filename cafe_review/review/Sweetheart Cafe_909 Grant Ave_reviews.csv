Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"What a fun snack and dessert shop!  I enjoyed the hot grass jelly with all the condiments (red beans, small and large bobas) and grapefruits tea with bob.  Staff is friendly and no wait during weekdays. Will try the home made sesame ice cream next time.  Supposedly sesame has antioxidant, anti inflammatory, heart healthy, and improve hair effect"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Wow this place was amazing! Service and food was beyond phenomenal! The server Ilene helped me out so much. She was so great at making me feel safe! Come here if you want amazing boba!
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,boba was actually pretty good! got a passionfruit tea + boba for $5.5
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"The HK milk tea boba is great. They also have a whole bunch of other foods and desserts.  Worth a stop. If you do visit, just go ahead and go to one of the tablets and order through their electronic system."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"i waited ~10 min for a matcha latte. i was the only one in the store & there were two employees. i mean, benefit of the doubt, maybe they had a bunch of online orders? but i highly doubt it. it didn't seem like it. so i thought ok, this should be the best matcha of my life... omg it was terrible! tasted like... soap water? they tried to tell me it's because i got almond milk. i get almond milk all the time, i drink a ton of matcha. they offered to make me another but i really wasn't keen on waiting another 10 minutes. i just threw the drink away instead. a huge waste of almost $7!  went down the street to lady luck café, where the matcha was bomb 💣"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I will literally be stopping at this cafe every time I am in SF. Their taro milk tea is unique with creamy taro and boba; it was perfectly balanced! I enjoyed trying their coconut egg puffs or I think they call them bubbles, but it's like a delicious pancake tasting treat with more subtleness and a little crunchy flake between bumbles. I ate it way before I thought of taking a picture of my food, I am sorry! The female owner was kind and helpful, infact she recommends the Taro as my milk tea choice, and wow was she right!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I ordered the Hong Kong milk tea and it is amazing! It’s jus like the “cha chang tang” (Cantonese diner) style which is amazing! Sweetness and milk level is perfect! I would definitely come back for more, the boba is spot on as well"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,The boba was amazing! Id definitely ask for the jasmine tea sweetened next time.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,My favorite place to stop-by when in the area. Lovely egg waffle and a great selection of boba. I tried Oreo bingsu (not vegan) this time. Small shop and lovely staff! Definitely worth a visit!
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I ordered the avocado smoothie with pearls and it has a well deserved spot on their top 10 list! Their passion fruit slushie with pearls is also delicious! The chocolate and original egg waffle is good as well, but if I were to order it again I think I'd go with just the original flavor. All in all, I'm very happy with my visits to this Cafe and I would definitely recommend going!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"The worst boba order I ever experience. Ordered through UberEATS, the apps saying the food is ready but its not, I have to wait another 37 mintes until its ready and the server keep saying 5 minutes (every 5 minutes), it took 1 hour from the time I order until the food is ready. The server is rude and the popcorn chicken is barely cooked. I order 2 popcorn chicken and 1 boba, how hard is it to make? My kids was late for basketball game because of them."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Tasty treat but it took a long time to get it.  Enjoyed the bingsu and Taro milk tea.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Randomly came across this little place and had to try it, got the egg waffles and the daily special and it was all good :D definitely one of the better places I've had. Will stop by whenever in the mood for boaboa and in the area, staff was really awesome as well.  At least try something from here once :)"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Ginger milk was the real deal - made of real ginger juice and warm milk (turned into pudding like texture), but the wait was very long (25 min). Egg waffle was ok."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"My friend and I stopped for fruit tea and it was pretty good, but I especially liked their takoyaki. Really flavorful and a good snack."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Crowded and compacted location. The layout crowds everyone into an aisle and is not clear who is waiting to order and who is waiting to pick up their order. They seem to sell almost anything: drinks, ice cream, snacks, and lotto scratchers (and maybe even tickets)? There's also a rude underage kid (???) that seems to work or helps out here? The egg puff was not bad albeit a tad on the pricey side at $3.99 each."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Still open during the pandemic, boba tea is still delicious here. You can order online for pickup now, so you don’t have to wait."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Really great for 9PM dessert craving in San Francisco on a Sunday night!!! When one is from out of town, it becomes difficult to search for good dessert places, especially when one is seriously having a sweet tooth! Definitely recommend this place! I got the matcha smoothie (no pearl) and the chocolate egg waffle (plain)...hit the spot!!!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Gave them 5 stars before COVID. Now it's a 2- star spot for me in 2023. 4-star food, 1-star service,  1-star atmosphere."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Get the popcorn chicken!!! Freshly fried very flavorful crispy outside soft in side yummy yummy🤤 …
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"For To-go boba milk tea, if you don't tip, you will wait extra time."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Refreshing boba teas with a large variety of flavors.  Also offers other sweets.  Service isn't the fastest, but courteous."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Delicious! The brown sugar milk tea is delicious, I went back for seconds. Be warned, the jasmine tea is like a candle in your mouth, stick to sweet things unless you enjoy natural/earthy tones"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Nice old school Cantonese desserts. Their ginger milk curd is delicious, so are the grass jelly drink (if you like herbal flavors) and double skin milk. Many of these are hard to find in sf and they do a great job here."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"We got Spicy Chicken popcorn, mango milk tea with boba and coffee boba tea. It’s really so good. Must visit and try 😊 …"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Chicken is great. And boba tea!!
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"There is always a line of people out the door which should tell you that this place is worth the wait time. Highly recommend Mango pomelo sago drink, popcorn chicken, and really anything else because everything is yummy."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Had some pretty old or just bad fish ball, will stick to popcorn chicken next time..."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"If you like grapefruit and green tea, this is your place to get it. Perfect mix and very refreshing."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I had to wait 48 minutes for my order, almost an hour. They gave me my drinks after about 30 minutes and had to wait 18 minutes more for my popcorn chicken. Plus it wasn’t even that good. I recommend to just go somewhere else and not waste your time here."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"i really like their avocado boba here! it's very creamy, and you know they put in pretty much a whole avocado for your drink. there is seating upstairs, which is generally pretty empty. it's useful when you get snacks from this place."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"It was great and I really like their egg waffles. The crepes were really good. My favorite is the one with whipped cream, strawberries, and Mandarin oranges. You watched them make it right in front of you. It was also nice because there was a second floor with tables for me to sat at."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!!!! This food is so not overpriced, it's so cheap, even for San Francisco. I got a strawberry and banana crepe, french fries, and a regular sized passion fruit boba drink that completely made my night!! And only for $13! We'd just fine to this super bland ramen place and after walking for a bit ,decided to go in since they had a seating area, what a pleasant surprise to find that the food we ordered was delicious!! I'm stopping here again before I leave SF!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"The Spicy popcorn chicken is my favourite, not to forget the Boba Tea was amazing."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Service was extremely slow. The teen boy making the drink called my number and then didn’t give me my drink for so long until his dad or coworker came by and told him to give me my drink. The drink itself wasn’t that great either and the boba was overdone. Not worth the excessive wait time! Perhaps the food is better or it’s better when other employees are working?
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Very popular local ""has everything"" Chinese dessert shop. Has boba, crepes, waffles, traditional Chinese sweets, even bingsoo (Korean saved snow) that's relatively well-layered! Orders are made fresh, so when crowded, waits for non-drink orders can take 10+ minutes. They do have a small upstairs seating area (where they can deliver non-drink orders upon request)."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"tastes great, ask for the brown sugar milk tea with fresh milk!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Had been here before and it was good. But the last couple times the service has been really bad and the drinks taste funny. Not sure what’s going on.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I used to love this place... One of the few places that makes Sago drinks.  Unfortunately, over the years, service has become terrible. The woman behind the counter was not happy that I asked why we had to wait 15 minutes to get a drink made and why other people were served ahead of us. The also only list prices for their toppings but there is no mention how much the base drinks are. Prices have been crossed out on posted signs."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I got here bubble tea! And soybean pudding (Dou Hua, 豆花). So great!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"They offer a very tasty and generous bowl of Zi Ma Hu aka warm black sesame paste! Looks strange but this was made well - smooth, right temp. Yum!  The seating upstairs was a pleasant surprise and a comfy place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the streets downstairs."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Tons of chinese fav desserts here!
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Sweetheart Cafe always have more than what normal dessert shop can handle for the area and price. It's the only shop on Grant Ave that shines throughout the night as everything around them have closed. Most of the time the shop is run by two guys with service being good satisfactory. I came in for a durian sago drink at $7 a pop. Good durian flavor taste like the just hull the inside of durian to make the drink. Sago was a little warm, but I mixed it up and made it colder this finish everything. Asian dessert shop that does everything from boba to egg waffle and falling snow."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I loved there place, I love Asian snacks and Asian food as well, if if it means it’s just something to go or to try in general. however my one visit there I might have accidentally grabbed the wrong drink because I thought I might have heard my order bc I had ordered boba petal green milk tea (I didn’t order as to what size I wanted tho). And to my assumptions I thought the tea cups were all the same size. so i might have accidentally grabbed the wrong drink because I was confused. So if by chance one of the employees or store manager reads this, I am so sorry about taking somebody’s drink, my actions were never intentional and I wasn’t paying attention. If I come to decision to drop in, I will surely pay whatever you need of me. Thank you very much 🙏🏻!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"The black sesame paste was great, milk tea was hongkongese style which i prefer not add pearl. The drinks were decent but the wait was horrible! I waited 30 mins for my black sesame because they thought i sat upstairs but the receipt clearly indicated 1st floor. Anyways, maybe today is X'mas so make it extra busy?!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"There coconut boba is to die for. I dream about it. The popcorn chicken is the perfect side dish And the egg waffles...remind me of nomming Them on the street corner of Hong Kong. The taro, the milk tea Also declious"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Big selection of milk tea, snacks, ice cream, bingsu (shaved snow) and authentic Hong Kong desserts. Who would have known such a small place could produce so much. Clean upper story seating area."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,great smell but very very slow service and nowhere to sit
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,This place was cute. A bit spendy.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Get the ginger milk, roasted milk tea or popcorn chicken! It’s not the quickest boba shop but the flavors are on point. Popcorn chicken is tasty and well seasoned!"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I'd probably never have come here if it wasn't recommended. The popcorn chicken is DELICIOUS. Definitely suggest covering it in chile powder, salt and pepper. You'll know it's enough once you start sneezing."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,First times here on a mini-vacation. Overall the service great and the dessert is delicious. I order two seame ball one regular and one almond so good.

Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Matcha bubble waffle lacked flavor.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Pretty good tea and milk tea but a little pricey.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,My daughter and I had a reservation for 12:30 on a Saturday (6/20/2020). This was her first dine-in since the Covid19 Shelter in Place. You have to have reservations to dine-in. No walk-ins. No cash payments.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"I love that they have an upstairs because sometimes, i would sit up there and eat popcorn chicken with milk tea and boba. They also have a rack of chinese/japanese/korean snacks on a wall. However, i never got on because it seems kinda sketchy. it's been there since i could remmeber."
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Flavor was ok ( ordered taro coconut sago), unfortunately it took 20 minutes to receive the dessert and even then we didn't get what we ordered ( missing coffee)."

Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"The bubble teas are refreshing and tasty. An interesting mix of items are offered for sale here. Ice cream, fried food, egg waffles"
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,Not the best Chinese desserts or drink place. But I sometimes get their iced milk coffee here. It a shot of espresso rather than from a pot of cheap coffee that has been sitting around for hours.
Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"like their egg waffle.  tried it first time in 2016/1/1  price $2.99, came back for 2nd visit, the price went up to $3.99  Still tasted good and good customer service."

Sweetheart Cafe,909 Grant Ave,"Food: 2 Decor: 2 Service: 3  Got 1.5 scoops of red bean ice cream and popcorn chicken, but neither was very good. Ice cream was Dreyer's, and popcorn chicken was too salty."
