Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Yesterday I failed to eat breakfast or lunch. Today, I wanted a substantial breakfast. Cafe Bianco Googled up near the post office where I mailed off the last of two tax returns I spent yesterday finally getting finished by overruling a ‘tax expert.’ Nice space, lots of light, and available tables at 10 am. I am tempted to sit here and write for a while. At first, I was concerned that their excellent, simple but delicious menu would not leave me as stuffed as I desired. Then, to the side, I saw their special offering--bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwich on sourdough. Excellent. I am well-stuffed and satisfied. Good coffee in a great cup I'm tempted to steal...I mean... tempted to ask if I can buy. I shoveled it down so fast I didn't get a photo of the sandwich. But here is a pic of the great cup and the remnants of the sandwich. I'll be back, perhaps for a couple of hours of writing if I can get it in before they get crowded. Surely they get crowded at lunch."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Food and drink are okay. Location and interior are great.  Had an egg & cheese sandwich on sourdough. Was pretty flavorless. Really could’ve used a sauce or spices and more variety in cheeses.  The hot chai latte was a better experience but only just. A bit too watered down and only warm, not hot."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"I wasn't really sure what I wanted to eat for lunch, so I was browsing through Ritual and saw this place was nearby and wanted to try it. I got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich which came with pesto aioli, provolone, roasted peppers, arugula sun dried tomato on a dutch crunch bread. It was really good! The service was quick and very friendly. The decorations seems very cozy and a nice place to just sit. There was a decent amount of people just sitting and either working, reading, or having conversations while eating. There are lots of other things on their menu that I would like to try in the future. Highly recommended!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Great family run cafe, didn't get a chance to try their coffee, but got a Dutch crunch scramble egg and sausage, yum yum yum. Love this local gem that has a lot of history and great quality food."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Friendly locally-owned spot downtown- who knew that was a thing?! Fast service, tasty food, good place to work or have meetings. Pass by Starbucks with their union-busting BS, much better things await around the corner."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"This is my second time here in a week and it feels like the last long time family run spot in the FiDi.  The family is so nice and accommodating, and the food is excellent and well priced.  The ambiance is very New York feeling or older San Francisco.  I will be back over and over again.  The salads and wraps are excellent!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Very friendly staff and amazing food. Only slightly disappointed with the lack of gluten free options but apart from that a fantastic cafe which is well worth a visit.
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"A great place to meet a friend, read or just sit and listen to yourself think. I love this place because it’s spacious, filled with light and not noisy at all. Has the feeling of a Kaffeehaus or bistro - in other words a European feel to it."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Very nice place for breakfast or lunch. The staff is great and the food delicious!
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Food was excellent, wholesome  and healthy.  Ingredients were fresh and service was awesome."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"The eggs in my sandwich were fluffy and hot, so good!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Great food and coffee at a good price. Friendly service and staff.
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Delicious spinach, egg white and feta wrap."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Wonderful lunchtime experience!  This is a mom and pop run restaurant with amazing service and delicious food at a very reasonable price for the financial district.  I ordered their special hot meal of the day, which tasted like a five star restaurant cheese ravioli, with a beautiful kale apple salad on the side, but it was only around $12.50.  You order your food at the counter and pay, then they bring it to you when it's plated. Since the food is already prepared it's fast and lots of people also take it out.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.   The older gentleman behind the counter took the time to explain their menu to me and their specials. Then the cashier poured me a glass of water and helped me carry my dishes to my table.  The sitting areas are clean and bright with an Art Deco style.  I can't wait to go back!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"I keep coming back to Cafe Bianco for breakfast and lunch. It’s family run so I’ve gotten to know the father and son duo, and they are wonderful! The prices are unbeatable in this city. Try the breakfast burrito or toast with almond butter for breakfast, and any of their sandwiches for lunch (they have a havarti with dill option, YUM!). Their coffee is also fantastic, the beans are from a local Bay Area roaster that makes them fresh for Bianco. I’ve actually bought their house blend beans as a gift for my parents down south, and they LOVE them! Highly recommend this place!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Got a classic lox bagel and it was pretty unappetizing
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,I was there on opening day in the late 1970s and Caffe Bianco has only gotten better over the years. A must-stop when in the financial district… particularly at lunch time! Wonderful!
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Good coffee good sandwiches. Is there anything else that need to be said.
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"If you're in the area, this is the place to hangout or do your work. It's a nice European style atmosphere. I usually get their sausage, egg and cheese Dutch crunch roll breakfast sandwich when I'm around. Customer service is wonderful. They have WiFi for customer to do work here. Plenty of space upstairs too, which makes this an ideal place if you don't want to deal with the crowd at Starbucks."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"My favorite espresso place in downtown SF. I like it's European vibe and the excellent (I think father/son) team that greets and serves guests. Highly recommended.  Haven't tried the food, but all coffee and tea choices are excellent."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Beautiful and spacious old-style cafe for breakfast , lunches, or teas/coffee.  The portion is big and the varieties are unbelievable.  You feel welcomed there.  The second floor is a great place to take a relaxing break or make some strategic plans with your business or your potential clients!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"A gem on the edge of the financial district.  Fresh savory salads made every day. If I could buy a subscription to a few meals a week at this place, I would! Very friendly staff, fresh, fresh, fresh options.  Also a great place to sit and chat."
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Best sandwhiches in the northern hemisphere! If you're wondering the coordinates of this devine establishment, you can find it at 37.7900° N, 122.4012° W"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Amazing! The staff were so friendly! The food was really good as well!
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"Had a business meeting there Yesterday. Very great and quiet place to meet. Unlike Starbucks that becomes very busy and music too loud, this place is really ideal to have meeting with you business partners. Here you can actually have a conversation :)"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Great lunch spot in the fidi. I’ve tried about everything on the menu and haven’t been disappointed. Don’t skip the salad of the day display. Always some nice surprises in there like beets with whipped ricotta cheese and pistachios.
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"I've been going to Caffe Bianco for about 4 years. It's an independent sandwich spot with coffees.  The food is solid and they carry my favorite brand of Chai... which is Bhakti Chai, which makes it even better.  Either  owner and his son are always there, and the staff don't seem to turn over quickly.  The caffe has marble tables on the first floor and also has a mezzanine.  I recommend it for a break from the cookie cutter eateries that have taken over the Financial District.  Enjoy!"
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,This place was delicious. And the sandwiches are huge. Everything tasted so fresh. 10/10 would recommend
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,Fantastic little cafe that is perfect to enjoy your coffee and pastry at your pleasure as you watch the world go by. The coffee is well made and the pastries are delicious. The decor is also very inviting.
Caffe Bianco,39 Sutter St,"It doesn't matter where my Financial District errands take me, when I am ready to have lunch or write awhile, I head to Caffe Bianco for the old-school, San Francisco café experience. Some cafés are so perfect it makes me want to cry. That's how I feel about Caffé Bianco. Last time I visited, the owner, Banny, mentioned he's been there 35 years, and I just read that the Hobart Building is over 100 years old."
