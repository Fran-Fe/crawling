Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"I just tried this place on a whim. And let me tell you, it was an amazing decision! The owner is friendly and the coffee was superb! I had a Mexican Mocha and it was one of the best tasting coffee drinks I've ever had! It was delectable and placated my coffee addiction for a while!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"I happened to stumble across this cafe and am so glad I did! Simple menu, delicious coffee, great record selection and genuine and friendly service. I only want good things for this place! Already looking forward to going back soon."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Cool little spot with records and good music! Really chill service and conversation too
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Very small cute shop. They have coffee, some pastries, records, art etc. We got two lattes the Mexican Mocha and the horchata. Both were delicious and not overly sweet which I always appreciate. Also got two spinach and feta pastries which were amazing. Definitely worth a stop."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"I Like this place but it’s frustrating that they don’t post an accurate schedule or keep to their posted hours.  I tried to go twice this week during hours when their website and their sign outside says they should be open, and they were closed with no explanation or notes on their website.  Consistency is important to me in a coffee place if I’m going to be a regular.  That said, food and drink quality are great if they’re actually open.  Edit to reply to owner:  having to close due to health reasons is understandable but next time please at least post a sign.  Your reply says back to normal hours “next week” but I have no idea what that means since you didn’t include a date.  Please be specific so people can plan their day!!  We need to know when you’re open and when you’re not!!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"The coffee is top top level.  Raul and the staff are amazing, welcoming, and friendly.  The shop is so cool and has an excellent collection of books and music.  I'm not going anywhere else!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,A sweet little local coffee place that also sells records. It’s a stone’s throw away from where I live. Hoping it becomes my regular morning coffee stop. Definitely coming back for more.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Very good coffee and pastries and Chris, the bartender, made me feel welcome everyday.  Besides, the second-hand records worth a browse."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"This place is great. Always fast even if there's a small line. But even if there is, the owner is always talkative. And the coffee is great. I usually get a macchiato which has good balance but it can sometimes taste like the espresso is a little under or over extracted. Overall I love this place.  It is cash only!! So be careful of that one."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,The best chocolate croissants I have ever had and I have tried many croissants in my life. The mocha is also superb.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Cool, chill spot for great coffee. Raul's Mexican Mocha and Eddie's Horchata Latte are our favorites."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Great coffee, real cups. In SF."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"My favorite coffee shop in the city! Better cappuccino than Sightglass / etc. alongside a far better experience.  Amazing beans (I buy them for making my own espresso-based drinks) and the owner is extremely friendly. It’s a model local business.  It was recently renamed Cafe Suspiro, used to be called Vega, and is becoming a record shop + cafe. Highly recommend trying it out!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Among my favorite coffee shops in one of the greatest cities of coffee shops for two main reasons: the drinks are fantastic (try the New Orleans iced coffee for a real sweet treat!) and the service is genuine - it truly feels like that small-town warm & welcoming coffee shop! It also has a fun sports feel with lots of soccer apparel hanging along the walls
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Lovely little coffeeshop in downtown SF. Very cozy with music and books. Right next to an art gallery too!
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Our favorite local coffeeshop. We feel fortunate to have a place like this within a block! Raul's got a wonderful vision for coffee, books, music. We have been enjoying his coffee and company for years and look forward to the evolution of the shop."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"perfectly curated little coffee, book and records shop.  a new jewel in the SOMA neighborhood."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Great coffee starts with great people and this place has both! From the drip to the espresso, every cup is made well. You can even order a box of coffee for work meetings or to bring to a party. Stop by and check this place out. You'll soon become a regular 😁 …"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Awesome neighborhood spot for good coffee, records and books to browse and chill"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Very chill, good coffee, food, AND records. Friendly guy working there."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Excellent coffee, pastries, and the owner is a delight to chat with. Very approachable and not snooty, unlike some other places in the area. Favorite coffee shop in the city!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Great coffee, super friendly staff."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Vega is great, the staff is all super friendly and they love our dog!  I promise he's not read, he just looks like that."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,I bought a hot chocolate from here today 10/14/22 it was good 👍 and the person caucasian was very polite and they let me charge  my cellular device  for a few minutes inside  the small coffee shop  .
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Had the best ham and cheese croissant of my life here and the horchata latte was so good the owner was so sweet too
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"The owner was friendly and shared us some wonderful ideas about incorporating their cafe with lots of art and music.  As a neighbor, I am looking forward for their business progress."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Excellent coffee, great staff. Easily my favorite coffee shop in the city."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Great spot! Stopped by with my dog, Moose, this week for the first time and enjoyed a tasty horchata latte. I’ll be back for many more!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Wonderful selection of records and amazing coffee and pastries. Owner was nice as hell too.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Best cappuccino in the city - never burnt, always perfect! I've had it here at least 20 times (worked nearby) and it's so much better than Sightglass' and Blue Bottle's. The staff is friendly, especially the slightly round guy whose name I forget. The owner refused to take shortcuts, which is amazing. Also good croissants (get them before they run out, before 8:30 usually)."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Great coffee. Love the cold brew. And the owner is super friendly as well.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"True neighborhood gem. Used to be cash only - and is the kind of spot where, if you didn't know, they'd still serve you and let you come back whenever to pay. Now accept cards, but still have the same good-will, chill vibes. And great drinks. And tasty dessert treats. With good people behind the counter and sweet tunes above it. :)"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Great spot! Super friendly staff and excellent espresso pulls. So glad to have this in the neighborhood.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"A humble little coffee joint nested on Folsom. It's got cool decor and nifty gear. Beans are roasted in house, providing flavorful coffee of a fair variety to fit the palates of daily commuters. Definitely recommend checking this place out!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"This place has delicious coffee. There is barely any sitting room unless it's a nice day. On a nice day, you can sit in front on the ""patio."" I have only really had their lattes.  Everything in the cafe is scooter-themed, which is pretty interesting to look at while you're standing around waiting for your coffee.  The first few times I went, they weren't too busy and I enjoyed small talk with the barista. The last time I went was packed and busy and the woman behind the counter was making a lot of mistakes and pretty flustered, but it seemed like she might be new. The service was kind of slow which may have been on account of that or may be because they were super busy.  Anyways, the crucial thing is that their coffee is pretty delicious and a nice alternative to the super make-you-cringe hipsterdom of Sightglass down the street."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Best coffee shop in the San Francisco hands down. It's a small place that's decorated like a garage. You'll see little Italian scooters standing near the roof and posters of people racing Lambretta's. Excellent vibe and the staff is very friendly.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,I met barista here who was incredibly sweet to me. She noticed I was having a rough day and having her just acknowledge that changed my attitude. Thank you! And thank you for the espresso! While you're here get the mochi muffin. Seriously.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Consistently very good can get busy at times
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,My favorite espresso in the city. Thoroughly enjoy the shop design + service with every visit. :-)
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Amazing coffee, great services, yummy snacks. My favorite coffee place in SF!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"VEGA is a small coffee boutique that most notably, sells Blue Bottle Coffee. It has an odd location in between auto shops, bars, and hipster cafes. I did not like the fact that I would feel like I was intruding if I stayed in the shop, although there is a small bar area you can stand at once you buy your coffee.. In addition the employee was civil but not friendly. The coffee was okay.  Personally I would prefer to go to other, more ""traditional"" style coffee shops where you can relax and have a nice conversation."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,This is a great comfy hole-in-the wall coffee shop with incredible service and wonderful coffee. Highly recommend the iced horchata latte!
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Love to drop by Vega and grab a great cup of coffee. There is always a new scooter being a wallflower that I can admire. It's comfy, quick and tasty! Word on the street is they will be opening another location across the street - sweet!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but the almond milk latte was great. They also have this vegan pineapple mochi thing - I had two. Awesome!"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Super sweet little spot on Folsom! Love the old school ambiance and film playing in the background..it’s clear they keep regulars coming, and the reason is their friendliness :) The horchata latte is excellent👌🏼 Will be back! …"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"This place is awesome. Great coffee in a small but cute space (not big enough for working though). Plus the folks who work here are amazing. Very friendly, neighborhood vibe."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Love their coffee and whole beans are really good as well. We get the Clutch beans for our home. Highly recommended!
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Small quiet coffee shop with a decent cup of espresso.  Seats will definitely become uncomfortable after a while.  A lot of local workers drop by for a cup of good coffee.  No iced mocha though.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"My favorite coffee shop in a city full of excellent coffee shops. Friendly baristas churn out consistently delicious espresso beverages. You've tried the rest, now try the best."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Charming - totally SF, and QUALITY coffee. John Quintos does it again.  Vega is nothing like your average, everyday garage door coffee shoppe.  Seeing as how they're popping out all over SF as the Trend continues it's hard to stand out amongst the crowd. Vega has managed to do this with the small attachment of Goody Goodie providing quality pastries and baked goods to compliment your morning/afternoon/evening coffee.  Grab a coffee and go - on your scooter of course."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Coffee and Smiles/ good coffee starts with good people.We love to get our company meeting coffee here!
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Raoul was great! We appreciated the friendly  conversation and sending off with coffee beans to try at home. Vega Cafe is a wonderful find in SOMA.

Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"better tasting coffee than sightglass, with the con of not being open on weekends"
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"Tasty coffee (including some interesting variations you won't find elsewhere) and some good pastries. A great place to stop if you're just on your way somewhere, but there's no place to work for an extended amount of time or anything."
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Vega is great! Raoul and co. are always friendly and helpful. Try their home-made oat bars.
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,Solid Coffee shop.   Always my first choice in this hood if they are open.    Fantastic pastries and free cookies sometimes too!
Cafe Suspiro,1246 Folsom St,"This place is totally cool.  No chai here, but you don't need it as they even have horchata lattes.  Check out the vespas and Quadrophenia photo."
