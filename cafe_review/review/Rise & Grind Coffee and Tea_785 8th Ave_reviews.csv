Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Incredibly friendly staff greeted us, genuinely happy to see us as we walked in. Coffee was well made and delicious, but the Breakfast Sandwich really stole the show! The combination of flavors and textures, with the  gooey yolk, come together perfectly and have me rethinking how i make breakfast sandwiches at home!  Highly recommend :)"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Stopped by to get a cup of coffee just before they closed. The service was fast, coffee was delicious (multiple plant based milk options). Nice outdoor seating area, will be back to enjoy it."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,Very good breakfast and coffee! The breakfast sandwich was awesome! O got it without the aioli but my husband kept it on and it was tasty! My husband got the salted caramel latte and I got the creme Brule. Both were a great drink to sip as we strolled the park
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"I heard good things about Rise & Grind, and wanted to check out the nearby Golden Gate Park anyway, so I decided to check it out. I’m really glad I did!  R&G has a great selection of unique latte flavors, which is perfect for someone like me. I love sweet coffee drinks. I decided to get the crème brûlée latte. I was not disappointed. It was such a unique flavor, and just the right sweetness for me. They even took a blowtorch to the top of the drink to add a little caramelization.  Definitely check it out (and the park too) if you’re nearby."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Mornings tend to have a line up so you may have to wait a little bit but the spicy chai latte is the best! This place is conveniently located right across Golden Gate Park, perfect for coffee walks or baked goods.  Very limited seating on the patio outside so opted for takeout."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Such an awesome coffee shop in all regards!  Everyone working there is so nice, they get to know you and your drink order. There’s a wide drink selection with very cool latte options. it’s located right next to Golden Gate Park / short drive to the beach. You really can’t go wrong, this is a core part of the inner Richmond neighborhood and I always try to stop by for an iced horchata latte before going to the beach / the park. Give them a try, you won’t regret it!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"One of my favorite cafes in SF. Their large range of specialty drinks is fantastic; I especially love their mint cold brew and black sesame latte, but you honestly can’t go wrong with anything here. Just wish they would reopen their indoor seating like it used to be prior to the pandemic…it was a go-to place for me to get work done or meet friends for coffee."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"This coffee shop is a hidden gem. Their espresso drinks are consistently good, and they have a selection of pastries that pair perfectly with the coffee. It's also a great place to relax with friends."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"4.5 stars. The breakfast bunwich was heavenly - rich brioche bread, an egg that was just a touch runny, plus avocado and bacon. Our group had the peanut butter, cookie dough, and black sesame lattes - all were good, but just a tad sweet for my liking. Recommend ordering online on the weekend as the park foot traffic leads to some lines."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,I’ve only given 3 for service because the ordering system is with an iPad type device and there’s no interaction. Great delivery….. And OUTSTANDING coffee. I also had an Oatmeal Cookie which could possibly be one of the best cookies I’ve had.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"A very nice coffee shop on the outskirts of Golden Gate Park. Very interesting coffee selections at very reasonable prices, with a menu of delicious food to accompany. The Matcha waffle was highly recommended and with good reason. The coffee was reasonably priced, the staff was very attentive and quick, and the entire store was bustling with the warmth a coffee shop should have. The free wifi was also a very big bonus as well.  Tl;Dr: While not a location I'd recommend for brunch, I'd definitely be happy to bring my family and friends here if I wanted to take them out for a coffee. The drinks are galaxies apart from anything a starbucks could make, and the food and service are just icing on a delicious waffle."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,Rise & Grind is my local shop and they take care of me! On those mornings when I don’t want to make coffee it’s only a couple block to get a great Americano. Line can get a little long on weekends when it’s nice as there is not much else by the Park. Also Google’s hours continue to be wrong. Open M-F 8 am to 1 pm and S-S 8 am to 3 pm
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"They have a wide selction of lattes but I usually get their  brewed coffee, which is absolutely delicious. The breakfast sandwich is awesome and what I get when I want something that will stay with me through lunch time."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Non assuming neighborhood coffee shop with good smooth coffee, the chaga mushroom options if you like it or are curious, and food as well. İt's one of my go to stops after a walk in Golden Gate Park."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"A decent coffee shop in the suburbs of San Francisco.  Located in a residential area so parking is very tough.  Firemen and police officers just park illegally to get their morning coffee.  I don't remember their creme brulee latte much, but I do remember their avocado toast was good.  Friendly staff, safe neighborhood, seems to bring a lot of locals with their doggies over and overall a good morning stop.  I recommend it!"
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,Cute cafe off the beaten path. Stopped by here for the cold brew which was pretty good.  Staff was slow and not friendly.  They seemed more interested in talking with their coworkers and friends not purchasing anything rather than helping customers. No seats were available on the late morning. Seems like it gets a lot of people working from “home” on their laptops. They need to find a way to move people every couple hours if they want more business.  Only street parking is available...good luck!
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Got the Whopper latte, which is a malted milk and chocolate drink. Definitely not as sweet as a Starbucks drink, but not unsweet either. If you don't like super sweet coffee, this is the perfect level of sweet (If you do like sweet, you can order it to be extra sweet). It also had delicious crushed whoppers on top. I just wish that the candies didn't get mixed in with the ice cubes because I can't eat all of them when I finish the drink. I give this drink an 8/10."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,Best dirty chai on our 12 day road trip from Portland to Big Sur. Breakfast sandwich also delicious. Cons: No comfortable place to sip inside on a chilly morning.
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Delicious breakfast and even better coffee. I got the avocado toast and a cookie butter latte and then walked to Golden Gate Park to enjoy it, 100/10 experience."
Rise & Grind Coffee and Tea,785 8th Ave,"Great vibe, great coffee, get a drink and head to the park!"
