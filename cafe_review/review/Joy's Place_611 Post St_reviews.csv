Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Super cute little place. A quick walk from our hotel and we find the little gem.  Fantastic service and food to match.  We originally planned to share a breakfast sandwich, but had to get two because it was good. Not overwhelming on any one thing and balanced. Great eggy bread that was light and yet held together.  We ordered a Caramel Latte and a Cream Latte. Carmel was nicely balanced and not crazy sweet. The Cream Latte, on the other hand was cool, creamy and again so good we had to get two (because I was for sure not sharing with the husband beyond the first ""you gotta try this and give it right back to me"" sip).  Go and enjoy this cute little spot."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Blown away by the peanut butter cream latte. I then try the spicy chicken sandwich which at first didn’t seem that spicy but the heat creeps up on you as it bursts with flavor.  I was delighted to grab a quick bite here and service was friendly. Cannot wait to bring my partner in crime to this place.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Walked by this place yesterday and it looked cute.  Decided to come in for coffee and a quick bite this morning. Ordered an espresso shot, vanilla latte, Turkey sandwich, and tuna melt. Everything was delicious. The sandwiches were big and hearty. Definitely one of the better sandwiches I’ve had in awhile. Latte was also nice and tasty. Had only one gentleman working the counter and kitchen. Nice flow of customers but he handled everything well and service was not slow at all."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Joy’s Place is, true to its name, the place where joy resides. Joy in this case is one of the finest cups of drip coffee I’ve ever had and a generously portioned and delightfully flavorful bulgogi sandwich. My partner’s breakfast sandwich was similarly delicious and served on a soft but sturdy bun. She got the peanut butter cream latte - a delectable treat on a hot day.  The vibe is also fantastic; leafy walls and gentle music come together with cozy but not-too-crowded tables to make a very pleasant dining experience. The two folks behind the counter were friendly and efficient, making good use of the compact kitchen/coffee counter setup back there.  Bear in mind that the menu on their website is - from what I can tell - not fully accurate to their current offerings. Don’t let that deter you; this is the place to eat!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The staff here is friendly and the shop is cute. They didn't have decaf but the hot chocolate I had was pretty good. The fact that it has seating is great too as that seems to be hard to find downtown.  Will definitely stop by again!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Cute little place in the town. Sandwich well exceeded my expectation! Next time, I will try a few desserts for sure."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,I'm glade I have found this place. I like to go for a coffee and a snack late at night. I am so grateful that this place offers hours until midnight. Thank God. I hope the city will offer more things to do for us late owls.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,This place is very quiet I got a chocolate moose. Just wish their hours were a little more clear.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Joy's Place rocks. Great place to grab breakfast. FYI they open at 8 am don't be fooled by Google posted 9 am.  The breakfast sandwich is especially good. My wife and I really enjoyed stopping in for a quick bite to start our day.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Much needed coffee ☕️ stop! Recommend an oat milk cappuccino!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I had a tuna sandwich here, and it was genuinely one of the most disgusting things I've ever bought. I wouldn't even consider myself a picky eater eater, but this place has been burned into my memory. Sandwich was gross and had big chunks of raw non-diced red onions like someone just threw left over scraps on there with no care. I wish i just asked for a refund... Also this place looks nothing like the photos. In reality, its not warm and cozy, but stale ...bland...almost bleach like. It looks like a cafeteria from highschool.  I also bought an over priced cake dessert that was not worth it. Probably store bought and marked up...  Bruh, im shocked by the 4.3 (currently) star review of this place. Do not eat here."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Been there on a morning. Breakfast sandwich was very tasty and fresh. Coffee is 2$ and they have fast wifi connection. The only criticism would be about toilet cleanliness which could definitely be improved.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Food: Had the bamboo latte (green tea latte topped with a shot of espresso) and their breakfast sandwich. I recommend the bamboo latte but the sandwich was a little heavy. Service: Fast. Space: French cafe music is playing and it’s relatively quiet on a Saturday at 10:30am. The door is open for ventilation. The decor is modern but not overly trendy.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Stopped in for a coffee. Staff was polite. Ordered a cappuccino with almond milk. It was so sour I couldn't drink it. $5, very small, undrinkable. Hopefully just an off day."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Simple little place that gets the job done, wanted a quick dessert and so the joy waffle with honey and ice cream settled for a light and enjoyable dessert. Space is clean and bright, enough seats for around 20. Come stop by if you’re nearby"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Even better after remodeling. Best service ~
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Only way to describe Joy's Place is relaxed and cozy cafe. I always stop in when I'm in the area. I'm always greeted with a big smile.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,great breakfast sammich and coffee. It opens at 8 not 9am. Everything was fresh and delicious. Its worth stopping.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Food was great, and this place doesn't seem as packed as the other so we were able to get our food right away!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Went to this cafe one afternoon per a friend's recommendation. Got the ooh-so-enticing peanut butter latte and a bulgogi sandwich. Was not disappointed! Both were absolutely delicious. On top if that, the lady manning the counter was super nice and seemed to put some extra care in preparing the order. Would have added an extra star if the dishes from a previous customer (which seemed to have been left on the table for a while before I arrived) were cleaned up."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Came in the morning, it was not really crowded. Nice seating with outlets nice pricing and my matcha latte tasted good! Nothing more to ask"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Loved this place under previous owner, the red bean shaved ice was to die for! Unfortunately it’s totally different now, and despite what the menu says, they don’t have shaved ice of any kind. Boo. New owner needs to update the menu and their website to reflect what they actually serve"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I come here every day for lunch and order a ham and cheese croissant. Its always delicious and comes with a tasy side salad. Its very reasonably priced, and the service is always excellent!!  Today i got my usual ham and cheese croissant and cappuccino, the cappuccino was really good too! Bravo!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Cute spot to stop for a quick lunch or coffee and dessert. I had a roast beef sandwich which was served warm and a lightly sweet strawberry shortcake.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Great area, great setting with spaces to work?, good wifi, the sandwiches are delicious . Only the service is really bad , they don't deliver food or drink at your table even if you eat in , never smile and they all look grumpy"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Great cappucino - same as what you would get at a nice cafe in Australia or Melbourne. Would come back here again for my coffee.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Very cute cafe with a lot of room and working. Good green tea latte and fast Wifi is really nice.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Delicious tuna melt. Cheese was melted to perfection and the bread was toasted well. Hot chocolate wasn't the best I ever had, but still pretty sweet and tasty. Stop by if you're in the area! Didn't get to try their croffles but will do soon."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Came here about 4 years ago and loved the coffee and honey toast. The cafe had a warm atmosphere and felt welcoming. We visited SF again this past year and had to stop by again, however, it wasn’t the same. The shelves looked empty and they had changed up their menu. They also didn’t offer decaf coffee either. Overall still a decent spot for coffee and a quick bite"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"A small internet cafe, it was quiet, but cozy. The menu is somewhat limited, but everything there is carefully crafted and absolutely delicious. I was very excited to find this hidden gem, and will definitely be back!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I had a super pleasant time eating in here, they have a nice selection of food and drinks. The actual dining space is really mellow, and if you're someone who has sensory issues sometimes like myself, you will be able to eat and/or grab a drink here very comfortably :^)"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,I was walking and wanted a small but nice place to have a coffee and Joy's Place was a good option. I had a tasty mocha coffee and a bulgogi sandwich
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The taste changes depending on the sandwich maker also coffee same. Every time different taste! Bacon always comes out raw. Buying something from here is like gambling.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Cute cafe.  We had the red bean shaved ice and was very refreshing. The sweet potato in the latte just seemed too foreign to me.  I didn’t really like it.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"This place doesn't even deserve the name “Joy.”  🥴Average coffee and overpriced food 🥴There's wifi, but they intentionally removed all the power outlets 🥴Tables are not well cleaned; they always have crumbs and coffee drops 🥴Music is too loud and no tastes 🥴The girl is friendly, but the guy has a horrible attitude and UNhospitable service  Conclusion: Not recommended at all, period. ❌"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Came with my girlfriend on Sunday around noon. We were looking for cafes around downtown that offered indoor seating decided on Joy's Place. The current decor resembles a shell of what the pictures show, but I am hoping that they are able to return to how it was before. We ordered a drip coffee and the breakfast sandwich. The sandwich was by far one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had and would absolutely recommend it. I don't have much notes on the coffee other than it was fairly cheap and my girlfriend enjoyed it."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Ran into here for a last minute brunch and was pleasantly surprised! We had the breakfast sandwich and beef bulgogi sandwich which were both delicious. Bonus, the coffee was great (and cheap!)."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Best breakfast restaurant I have ever been too. I was eating there my hole trip even tho I wanted to try other places, I couldn’t. It was to good at Joy‘s."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Got a spicy chicken sandwich and a bamboo latte; both were very flavorful. Ate half in the restaurant (a clean but small place with available seating - the staff is polite and service is timely), took the rest home and ate it later - the sandwich still tasted good cold, which was a welcome surprise"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Loved the coffee, great taste! Now tasting this coffee in San Francisco, definitely won't miss Melbourne's."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"We love the green tea shaved ice. If you’re ordering for more than one person, get the large. It’s worth it. Vanilla shaved ice is our second favorite, and strawberry our third. Both are pretty good.  They make your order very quickly, and there’s almost always seating when we go at night, though the furniture is showing its wear"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Wait time was a little long during a not so busy time so I wonder how it get during a rush. They forgot my order too but the food was good! The spicy chicken isn't spicy but tasty. A good experience overall!.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The food is good and the drinks are made well... But they got rid of all the power outlets. A cafe without outlets? 2 stars max.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Updated review: As of April ‘19 Joy’s Place is under new ownership. They took out the sweet potato latte and the shaved ice desserts. I am very sad to experience this as Joy’s (to the best of my knowledge) had one of the best specialty drinks. The menu is revamped to include more food items. Perhaps I’ll come by for a bite or two.  Previous review: It does get a little crowded here at certain times. My favorite drink to get is the sweet potato latte. Their honeyed bread is also good
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Came here for a sandwich at 7:02 PM. Google shows they close at midnight but we were told that the kitchen was closed and all that we could get is coffee and pastries. Apparently they close at 8:00 p.m. and they close the kitchen an hour before that.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,We like it. Good sandwiches 🥪
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Was intrigued by the ‘croffles’, a cross between a croissant and waffle. A friend and I shared a nutella croffle and a bulgogi sandwich. I think the croffle is a bit overpriced for the value, where it was a single piece that was approx 5 inches long and 2 inches wide with a cold spoonful of nutella. However, the bulgogi sandwich provided more value and was more filling in comparison.  The interior is pretty cute, and the ambiance is relaxed enough to bring a laptop to study. The lighting is a bit dim, so maybe not recommended for reading."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Loved the green tea latte and honey toast here! The honey toast is a good size - 3 slices of thick buttery toast, with lots of honey, caramel sauce, cinnamon, whipped cream, and ice cream. One of my favorite honey toasts. The latte was good too.  There was no line at 10pm on a Thursday night, but the honey was toast took quite awhile to come out, so be prepared to wait a little if you order it. Very chill ambience, will definitely be back!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Had the breakfast bun….it was definitely one of the best things we had eaten since being here!  Small place, simply decorated. Definitely recommend!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"It's been called to my attention that I never reviewed this place, despite the number of times I've visited, which is... surprising. Honestly though, there's not too much to say: I've only ever come here for the patbingsoo, which is massively generous in portion size, and fantastically delicious in flavor, and definitely ideal for sharing. But hey, everything can be a personal serving if you try hard enough.  As for the place itself, it's a nice, chill little cafe that's been packed every single time I go, so seating can be a little hard to find at times. You'll usually find it occupied by folks busy working away on their laptops.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - On the smaller side, as far as cafes/coffee shops go, with about 2/3 of the seating being accessible: those along the walls were bench seating, and there's lower coffee table seating towards the right as well, leaving only the middle aisle and outer seats along the sides accessible.  Bathroom - Didn't try them."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I'm a specialty barista, and I can say they're some of the best coffee around the Union Square area. 3rd wave style. They aren't known as a specialty coffee shop - but more a small local-style cafe, but they should be. They coffee and espresso are both wonderful, and the staff are amazing. $2 for a 12oz delicious cup of well roasted well brewed black coffee.  They have complimentary wifi which is very fast and reliable, make sure to ask for the password before/with your order because they print it out on the bottom of your receipt or a new receipt stub. and great tables or a sofa for sitting and working - but unfortunately no outlets or charging ports whatsoever.  Bathroom is reliable and clean.  I believe they recently changed ownership, as of 2019, so they're going through a lot of changes with their food which I never partake in so I'm afraid I can't be very helpful there. They are rolling out lots of sandwiches which are intriguing. They are trying to push the sandwiches and food and not their coffee service which I think is unfortunate.  Unfortunately, they have no regular cafe pastries. I used to get my favorite chocolate muffin ever here - $5 for a large coffee and muffin the size of a fist, fresh, filling, and incredibly delicious; they've NOW switched to small overpriced pre-packaged muffins that are nastily sticky and taste of nothing but the plastic packaging, preservatives, and the truck they're delivered on. For a coffee shop, they should really have better breakfast options in the form of pastries and not just meals.  Open very late and usually bustling at night, especially weekends as people stop in for a bite after a drink."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Clean, pleasant place with friendly service. Massively disappointing food that seemed expensive for what you got. The ham and cheese croissant had a single slice of deli ham, and the shaved ice had an unpleasant texture and came with a glop of not very well cooked red bean."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,This is my fav place in SF. Great breakfast in a relaxed and cozy place.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Really good milk teas and shaved ice.  The red bean shaved ice tasted pretty much exactly like one I had in Japan.  The shaved ice takes quite a while (due to limited staff and meticulous preparation) but the milk teas were quick.  They also sell a variety of packaged candies.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Red bean shaved ice was good and definitely did not skimp out on ingredients! Green tea latte was solid. Ambiance was pretty nice. There were a lot of people studying there; as noted by others this makes for somewhat limited seating sometimes so keep that in mind.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,It's 10pm... it's not open.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Advertise as open to 12:00 (midnight) but when showing up at 11:10PM wanting a take out dessert told the kitchen (and bar) close at 11:00. So what’s the extra hour for? Just don’t keep the fluorescent “OPEN” sign on for an extra hour if a customer really can’t order anything off the displayed menu. First review I’ve been ever posted but don’t appreciate getting shown the door in any establishment when I come in to buy something...especially when they’re actively advertising as being open.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Tasty coffee and sweet waffles in this situation down, chique restaurant. Wheelchair and stroller accessible with tables mostly far enough apart to accommodate. Service not the fastest but matches the low key atmosphere."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Simple but refreshing shaved ice. There's a decent number of seats and free wifi so it's a pretty good study spot. Service does their job but has never been super friendly. Overall not somewhere I'd go out of the way for but I would stop by to get some work done.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Went twice, great staff (girl) but unfriendly owner (announced that he is). No power outlets, mediocre service & overpriced sandwiches 😤 👎"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Delicious and cute cafe near Union Square! My friends and I came here for iced coffee and green tea lattes. The green tea lattes had good matcha flavor. Joy's place also has free wifi with cute decor inside. The dessert section looked awesome and I have to come back to try their fruit tarts!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Cute café that doesn't suffer from the overcrowding that makes it hard to get coffee in this neighborhood. I had a solid cappuccino and a hot waffle with a scoop of ice cream. This is a good place to do some reading or work on your laptop if you bring one. There is WiFi and you get the password with your receipt.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Get the cheesecake and that's it. The other desserts were not great. Just not good simply put. They had little flavoring. Bland. The cheesecake was actually tasty and kept me wanting more but the Opera and the moose were not good.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Quiet, composed, sophisticated atmosphere good for thinking and offering carefully prepared coffee and light fare.  Service Staff are Korean with a special atmosphere and meticulous service.  A great alternative to the familiar glass and chrome coffee traps."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I stopped by here the other day after dinner while looking for a nice cafe that opened late, just to have some downtime to read a book. The people here are really nice, and the cafe is quaint and cute. The green tea latte was delicious and fit the ambiance really well. For those with techy gadgets, there are plenty of outlets all around to plug and charge up. Wifi works well and is free here too. They open until midnight most days, which makes it a great place to meet up with friends, etc.  I may make this my next hiding spot for working/reading..."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Great waffle nice atmosphere and pleasant music. It feels like they’re playing studio ghibli soundtracks here and it’s so peaceful.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Good coffee and sandwiches served by good looking Asian American staff who are friendly and accommodating as well. Most people here stay to work on stuff at their laptops so could be crowded.  Interiors are instagram-worthy.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Horrible service.  Reminds me of McDonald's but worste.  They don't address you by name your just a number.  I was here Sept 22 around 4:30pm to get an order to go.  The waiter said it would be around 15 minutes.  I walk out and come back in, he says another 5 minutes.  So I sit inside and wait.  When my order is ready I go to grab it and realize they are missing the cappuccino.  I ask where it is and he says he was calling the order and someone else came and grabbed it.  I ask if he could replace it since he let someone else grab it.  He said he could not and that I would have to pay again. I then see a sign saying smile your on camera..  so they have video footage of the guy stealing my order but cannot help me.  After paying for another cup I place it on top of the plastic to go containers.  As I'm trying to walk out the cups slide right off the plastic container.  I now ask him if I could get another cup with a cup holder.  At this point I paid for the same cup 3 times and it took forever to get.  Ice cream I had was all melted and food was cold."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Really cute little coffee place near Union Square that's open until 2AM most nights.  Go for the coffee, but really go for their unique Asian desserts-- gigantic bowls of shaved ice topped with red beans and green tea ice cream, honey toast, waffles, etc.  A rare find on this side of the city!  Free wifi."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Nice place, very good macrons! I walked in near closing time and they were very nice about letting  come in late and order...also they let me finish my pizza in there too, but nice place. The tiramisu is very good also, and reasonably priced"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Had the bulgogi sandwhich and a oat cappuccino. This place is bussin bussin. The guy working there was really nice and the coffee and food was delicious would come back again
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"The space is clean and cozy, but the desserts are just ok and the coffee is unimpressive. Their affogato would be better if they used higher quality ice cream. Their tiramisu is super dense and tastes industrial pre-made."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,I love this place. I usually don't write a lot of reviews but I feel like I need to say something.  The people at Joy's Place is awesome! I wish if each customer appreciate how hard these people work to keep this place clean and comfortable for others to set and read.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Nice quiet place with decent selection of food options and cakes/tarts. The coffee is 'san francisco' good, it's definitely above the city average, but not on the same level with high end coffees. Only giving 4 stars because of it."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"cozy and lovely coffee shop with excellent coffee, crispy cheese panini and exquisite cakes. We're here the second time in a row in two days and it won't be our last visit during our sight seeing trip in SF."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"An unexpected delight. Their Red Bean Shaved ice is to die for and is the perfect 2 person treat. Just be ready to stand while you are enjoying it. Some of the students squat in the restaurant's few seats for hours, especially late in the evenings."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Very nice and clean cafe, it got nice chairs and charging outlets for students and working professionals. Convenient location to get work done outside my apartment. I highly recommend this place.Great coffee and tea."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Quaint little cafe that serves Earl Grey & macarons until midnight. Definitely a happy place to hang out. It does get crowded, everyone else loves it too!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,So yummy! Very clean with cute decor.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Good place to get some coffee and work at night. Though it’s very likely to be crowded.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The Korean breakfast sandwich was delicious! And the coffee was very good as well!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,5 stars for the espresso! The best cup I've had in SF. Didn't get a chance to try any of the food but will definitely be back for the coffee!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,It is probably the only place where you can still find a really great cup of coffee between 6 and 10pm in city center. Loved their homemade tiramisu!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,This place gives me a peace of mind in the midst of crazy city life. Friendly staff and great coffee! They keep the place very clean!!!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,No power for laptops . Not really friendly
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Great atmosphere. They serve a huge waffle which I guess is meant to be shared. One of the better places with Wifi as well. Definitely will return.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Wonderful coffee from a wonderful cafe. Joy's was the only place we visited twice in SF. I would highly recommend Joy's to anyone wanting local, quiet, good price and good quality."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Perfect to grab a cup of coffee and sit and work. The cafe has wifi which is good and mostly working crowd and college students working on laptops. A heads up, for people looking for cafes for free WiFi."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Hands down best espresso martini
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Got the hot chocolate to help me with the cold cold night and it is sooo good! The barista was so friendly and is a sweetie. Definitely will return!
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Love the waffle, and with a tea was perfect to finish a long day biking. They have good prices, but dont expect a huge menu, is just simple and good!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Google's description says ""Asian desserts.."" failing to mention they have tasty macarons here! Fast internet, too, and ample seating. Keep it up(:"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The enormous accessory-laden red bean shaved ice caused the expected insulin surge and later crash but was an experience. Even the sweet-smelling air gave me a contact sugar high.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Located in downtown San Francisco, excellent place for working as there are many plug in stations and good WiFi. Some good coffee and waffles included."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Im from Houston I see the well known places are always a line so I tried this Joy's place I love it the whole time I've been here every morning I come here to eat I Recommend you. Try the ham and cheese croissant
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Tried their ice cream with red bean and shaved ice.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Expensive, small-sized coffees make this coffee shop feel like poor value-for-money. Limited food options but has great desserts: try the macaroons."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I ordered a latte and the waffle. The waffle was made fresh, and served with ice cream, whipped cream, almonds and syrup. Absolutely fantastic!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Nice place with a high-speed wifi (that's why there are lots of devs), good coffee, cakes (try Opera cake) and sandwiches! It's our neighborhood place to go for a coffee and chat!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Really cute little cafe with comfortable seating areas you can chat and do some work. Food was pricey (but hey it’s SF), but tasty."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Cute little coffee shop. Went in the evening to do some work and found ample seating, good hot cocoa, and a delicious bulgogi sandwich."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,It's a cute place with good coffee! I got the affogato which was really good especially if you like ice cream
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Great coffee spot but VERY busy. Serves desserts too. Lots of young hip crowd type.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"One of the few places in downtown SF, where you can get a tea after 4pm. They have decent desserts, too."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Great coffee and cake. Coffee tasted slightly burnt but didn't ruin the cup. Great music and environment
Joy's Place,611 Post St,I never seem to have a problem when getting serviced by a girl but this is now the second time a male employee with attitude and short temper. Dont think it had anything to do with the language barrier
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"The strawberry shaved ice is the bomb! Order the large to get more for your buck, nearly 4x the size of small (large 10$, small 5$)"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Super friendly and coffee's okay but I feel it's not right for people to see their mess in behind the counter and the garbage bag exposed to the public
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"It was good. I was hungry and was just walking by and stopped in to grab something. When im in the neighborhood again, I'd definitely go back."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Both the hot chocolate & matchs green tea are good. Drawback is it is very hot--no ventilation to speak of.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,My favorite place in San Francisco for hot chocolate and bingsoo. Their Affogato black is also delicious if you're a connoisseur.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The staff is amazing really helpful and friendly by far one of the best cafe/coffee shops I’ve been in and will be sure to come here again😊 …
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Cute little café. Very chill and has the best coffee, plus homemade desserts!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Best spot to coffee and Wi-Fi
Joy's Place,611 Post St,I said I will stay in the cafe. The tarte is on a damaged plate and the cappuccino not in porcelain cup but in one for takeout . Plastic fork and spoon. Really?
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Korean style café serving coffee and sugary treats. Great place to hang out and grab a nice hot drink late at night.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Does not look like much from the outside, but once you step in, you enter it is like you stepped into a different dimension. The interior is spacious, homey, and inviting."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Great coffee and chilli atmosphere and the staff is friendly... What do you want more?
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Loved the sweet potato latte and shaved ice. Just wish there could be a smile or even a ""hello"" from the folks working there."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Nice small coffee shop offering delicious treats (although not much choice) and great coffee made with love
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Banging breakfast sandwich 10/10
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Not a place to work due to weak or no wifi,  and no outlet.  Just grab and go"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Good tea and good snacks. Packed with the trendy, college age crowd which is fine but does make me feel old haha."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The hot chocolate is delicious
Joy's Place,611 Post St,Love their red bean shaved ice.  All the desserts we've tried have been good

Joy's Place,611 Post St,Horrible service
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"$16 Avocado sandwich was the worse avocado sandwich in my lifetime.  Brread, lots of lettuce and two slices of tomato… just look at it. Avoid this place !"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,This place is chill.  I found this place when I was waiting to check into my hotel. I got their tuna sandwich and it was surprisingly good. It wasn't anything like your typical mayo and mustard kind of sandwich. There was seasoned caramelized onion and that sauce was bomb. The bread was toasted and tender in the inside. I would go back! Something about it made it stood out from the rest.
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Revisited after a previous visit to Corona, I really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich at the time, so I ordered it again. Tasted just as good as before. Breakfast sandwiches are highly recommended!  Visited Joy's Place again after covid. Best breakfast sandwich ever, it was so delicious!"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Very nice place! Breakfast burger a bit small, the other type offered is quite large. Little vegetarian choice, unfortunately. Very casual and good service, you can order espresso. Overall recommended."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"I like all kinds of desserts in Joy's Place! Especially, the croiffle is so good and I highly recommend everyone to try this. Staff is so nice and kind. The place is really good to take a rest and talk with friends. I will visit again pretty soon :)  All the Joy's Place desserts are delicious! Especially crople is really delicious and strongly recommended. Please be kind to the staff too. It's a good cafe to take a break or chat with friends. I will visit again :)"
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Good cafeteria. Although they took a while to prepare my order, the food was of very good quality. Perhaps the coffee could be given in ceramic cups, so as not to have to use so much cardboard (it would be more ecological), at least if it is not to take away (as was my case). Otherwise, I really enjoyed my sandwich and my dessert (chocolate mousse)."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Nice Korean boss, it seems like a young couple. Relaxed atmosphere, good for a short stay. At dinner time, it seemed that there were many times when the seat was filled with single customers. The price is good too. Clean toilets, Wi-Fi available. There are various cakes and brunch menus, and since it is mainly coffee, there seems to be no other fruit drinks."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Ate two waffles with cream and ice cream, very good. A nice coffee to better enjoy all that sweetness. Spent $18."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"The grilled cheese sandwich was fragrant and full of cheese because the bread was baked throughout. The store is not very large. If the chair was a little more comfortable, it would be 5 stars."
Joy's Place,611 Post St,The boss is so kind! It was more nice to see you as a Korean 😊
Joy's Place,611 Post St,"Good coffee, quiet and stylish place. However, Visa cards did not work here.."
