Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,"Everything is made fresh here. We stopped in on our last night in the city. We were greeted right away and service was straightforward and accommodating. We ordered a passion fruit tea and whole grapefruit tea, both were made with real fruit. We also had the curry fish balls and durian and black sticky rice - all made fresh as well. The durian was super smooth and wasn't strong with the fruit's ""signature"" flavor. If you've wanted to try durian this would be a good start. We ate in the cafe before walking back to the hotel. Good vibes and good food."
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,I got the egg waffle and it was very tasty! My friend got the sesame balls and it came in a hot ginger soup that was sweet. The surrounding area was a bit hectic (people yelling) but we enjoyed the food here
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,Ordered a matcha latte with 25% sweetness which was just enough to balance out the natural bitterness of the matcha. Very freshly made and decent portions. Credit cards accepted and menu includes tax which is nice.
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,"Very fresh mango grass jelly ice, with I believe evaporated milk. I really like their grass jelly, not sweet at all, bouncy, which is just what we needed after a heavy meal. Portion is quite small and price was $8 for the ice. Drink was $7 which is also on pricier side, but made fresh."
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,Busy place that is open late.  Drinks made fresh .
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,"Their ginger milk curd/pudding (姜汁撞奶) is really nice! Very soft and freshly made, and not too sweet."
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,"It feels like they just don't care if we ordered or not.. we ordered regular hot coffee, matcha latte and egg puff with peanut butter - the coffee tasted like parsley a bit, the egg puff was with a little bit of peanut butter and it wasn't that good... the matcha latte was disgusting! There was only one pearson who was working in the kitchen while the other worker just sits and plays on his phone...  we got each of the things we ordered separately... We just left the drinks to the homeless at the park next to the cafe... Not recommended at all!"
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,Very nice staff. Good list of hot or cold drinks. They may be with Boba - small jelly balls. It is possible to drink sitting indoor but no restroom.
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,"We ordered a creamy strawberry( Strawberry Sea Salt Cream Cheese) that was amazing and so refreshing!

Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,I’ve been trying to try this place’s HK style milk tea. Very good. Also a big selection of other drinks and food.
Yu’s Cafe,57 Walter U Lum Pl,"Staff is so sweet!  I go here pretty often as I work in the financial district so it's right next to my office building.  Drinks always have a consistent taste and the staff takes their time to make the drinks, so don't expect your drinks in less than 2 minutes.  They remember their customers and will always occasionally give something extra for free, no stamp cards needed :) which makes it feel so special and like a family."
