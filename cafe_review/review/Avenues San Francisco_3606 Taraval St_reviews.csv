Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Nice spot cool vibe. Bahn Mi super fresh n tasty, good coffee too"
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Their musubi is so delicious, I always drop by here to grab some when I’m in the area. I also like how their matcha tastes; it has a nice and subtle earthy taste to it and the sweetness is adjustable. The atmosphere is also very nice! I love the surfer vibes and the store overall looks so clean and comfortable."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,So good! So fresh! The sandwiches here are to die for! We had avo toast and PB and honey with my 4 year old daughter. The words she used after her first bite: oh my goodness!! :)
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Favorite coffee shop in the Outer Sunset area! They serve really good Verve coffee roasters, and a variety of breakfast items such as breakfast banh mi and musubis! Really cute outdoor seating as well."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Upon entering you're greeted with the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Behind the counter you'll find pastries,  spam musubi, and a menu to order more.  My family and I got their chocolate chip and pretzel cookie, spam musubi, and breakfast sandwich.  Everything was delicious!  The only difficulty I had there was the cashier was mumbling quietly behind a mask. It made it incredibly difficult to order even when asking him to speak up because we couldn't hear him."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,the food here was so yummy and our oat milk cortados were perfect!! nice baristas and perfect breakfast and just a short walk to the beach ~
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,We walked across the street from Andy’s and this is the same menu with a less obnoxious atmosphere and a shorter line. The SF department parked their fire truck and chose this place too.  They made the fanciest green matcha I’ve had. And a pretty cool cold brew.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"I’ve been here many times and they have always taken good care of me and anyone that walks in. Their musubi is awesome, I love the bowl of soul and I had the banh mi breakfast sandwich which was super delicious as well! All in all, high quality beverages, great service and good selection of food, would highly recommend!"
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Unique beverage offerings, including tea which is a big plus for me. Their musubi is delicious and is so easy to grab and go. I'm also really appreciative of their other grab and go offerings like chia seed pudding and coconut water. When I have more time, I order the avocado toast or the breakfast sandwich. Both are very satisfying and taste fresh!"
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"I tried a salmon musubi, then immediately went back and bought another because it was so good! I definitely recommend this place."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"This is such a cute little shop, and they served up a delicious almond milk latte. The surfer themed artwork they have up on the walls gives it a perfect vibe."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Had some avo toast, coffee, and Musubi here. Loved it all. Their coffee is really good some of my favorite in sunset."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,The Breakfast Club sandwich and spam/kimchi musubi were so good we came back for seconds two days later.  The sandwiches were very filling and tasty. It had great elements of acidity and creaminess to it that balanced out really well. Loved the crunchy and creamy textures too. They're made to order so it's all super warm when it's all done.  The musubi is such delightful food item that has its own little gojujang dipping sauce to go with it. You can grab it and go or just sit and eat.  There's a cool little sitting area right outside the shop where you can enjoy your food too.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"The neighborhood wouldn’t be the same without it! Super friendly staff who take the time to get to know their neighbors. Firm faves are the musubi, breakfast banh mi and the breakfast sando."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Vibey surf-island spot with delicious noods, spam masubi, and coffee."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Wonderful local coffee/surf shop with great home made rice horchata cold brew and super tasty food. My new fav is the panini pressed grilled cheese & creamy tomato soup combo. It replaced the breakfast sando which replaced the avo toast.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Best OB apres surf option quickly becoming an institution in our morning sessions. Cool staff, verve coffee, house made spam musubi, avocado toast and a delicious club sandwich? What more could you want for kicking off a perfect day."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Stopped in for a coffee and to work on/edit my Seattle episode videos.  And when I went for a refill...the barista bought it for me.   He is one of the many humans with wings that I encounter and post about every single day.  There's so much love out here among us humans. It's people like him that make my journey what it is....full of peace n love :)
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Nice alternative to Andytown. Surf shop in the back has nice selection also. If you want something sweet, try their cold brew horchata (made in house). Pizzas (meat and vegetarian) are delicious, and on Tuesday it's only $2."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Avenues SF just opened with the tastiest Verve coffee, healthy unique food made from scratch,  fresh boards and other surf essentials to try or buy, and a laid back staff. I’m stoked!  If you live in SF or are visiting and like to surf or hang at the beach, this is the all in one place. Check it out!"
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"So, there was nothing wrong with my flat white or advocadotoast, but the customer service was the worst. The girl working there was in such a bad mood that I though about leaving before she made the toast. I know that life is about ups and downs, but it was like she really didn't want a customer. Next time I'll go across the street!"
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,There is nothing like a stop for a morning snack and coffee on a sunny day after a bike ride on the great highway.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,I love Avenues! This is my go to coffeeshop.  They are pet friendly and have a lovely patio out back.  Eddie and his staff are welcoming and the coffee is fantastic. Try the horchata iced coffee.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Good light snacks, biggest item is breakfast sandwich.  Good variety of teas.  Only minus - when Verve runs out of snacks, nothing else to choose from."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,I like this place for their coffee and toasts. This location is really close from my house and sometimes my morning starts here. Good customers service. Highly recommend if you like a good coffee.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Solid every time. Verve ground beans pulled expertly through the La Marzocco. Surfer dude barista with morning bed head makes it legit. Great gadgets along with stellar Masubi = go time.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Cute but will take about 45 minutes to prepare avocado toast
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Favorite post surf coffee spot.
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Real good coffee and pastries  Bonus: they do matcha lattes 🍵
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Friendly staff, helpful with a genuine gracious smile, decent Verve and a bakeshop a pastry chef would be envious of... savories await those after an early morning wave... A fourth star awaits them...."
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,"Kind service, great cappuccino!"
Avenues San Francisco,3606 Taraval St,Avocado toast with bacon and egg. Absolute perfection.
