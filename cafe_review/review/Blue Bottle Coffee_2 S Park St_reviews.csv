Blue Bottle Coffee,2 S Park St,"I’ve heard people talk about Blue Bottle before, so I thought I’d check out one of their  coffee shops while I was in town. I wasn’t disappointed.  Although, there weren’t fancy syrup flavors for someone like myself who likes sweet flavored lattes, they still had a “sweet latte” on the menu. If you’re into sweeter coffee drinks, I’d highly recommend it. Very delicious.  There’s even a gorgeous park right around the corner you can hang out in after you get your coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,2 S Park St,Clean coffee shop with basic decoration. Love the style of their icon. Water is offered by self serving. Coffee tastes great but higher price than other shop.
Blue Bottle Coffee,2 S Park St,It’s really amazing how Blue Bottle grew from its Bay Area operation to a global level. Had good experience at every Blue Bottle we’ve visited in the Bay Area so far. Hoping to see more Blue Bottle and less Starbucks. We ordered their seasonal NOLA iced coffee and the oji pourover. Their seasonal flavor is this orange blossom which adds well to the already delicious creaminess. The oji pourover was expensive but the flavor profile is simply excellent. It was strong yet super smooth. My only problem with Blue Bottle is the price point. I mean coffee is expensive in general if you’re not going for the $1 McCafe coffee from Mickey Dees.

Blue Bottle Coffee,2 S Park St,Solid blue bottle location. This place gets a lot of traffic so line can get long but staff moves quick! Theres a decent amount of seating and large tables for working at. Due to the high volume of people it can get a bit noisy if you are trying to get some work done.

Blue Bottle Coffee,2 S Park St,You really can't go wrong with Blue Bottle coffee. It's consistently very good and the staff is friendly.  The interior is modern and clean with spots to sit and work. The only downside is it's more expensive than most cafes.
