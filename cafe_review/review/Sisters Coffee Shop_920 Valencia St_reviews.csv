Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Sisters coffee shop is a vibe! It’s an interested spot, with cool decor. Interestingly enough, it reminds me a lot of cafe con azucar in San Jose, in terms of decor. Very chill vibes with wifi, but to take meetings, not the quietest just a heads up. Overall great!"
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"From the moment I walked in, I was greeted. With a smile on their faces, staff was ready to take my order. I didn't know what to order, and their suggestion was more than perfect. Food is delicious and the decorations/presentation of the dish was great. Highly recommended if you are looking for something to eat on Valencia st in San Francisco."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Unexpectedly delicious hidden gem with great service. Their prep cook could slice things a little better, but delicious coffee and I had a fantastic chicken pesto here."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Situated on bustling Castro Street, Sisters Coffee Shop is a vibrant hotspot that serves up a delightful array of coffee, boba, smoothies, and other quick bites. With its captivating ambiance and excellent workspace, it's the perfect destination for capturing social media-worthy moments. Plus, it's conveniently suited for a quick visit."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Stopped in for a quick bite. There were tables inside and outside in a covered parklet. The tamiles were heated up and presented well. Green juice was good as well.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"I stopped here for a quick coffee before heading to the bookstore a few doors down. It was clean and beautifully decorated and my drink was tasty. The food looked good but I didn't try it, I will have to come back for it."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Just found this coffee shop today. I must say that I just love it. I had a coffee and a breakfast sandwich and was so very impressed with the taste. The customer service was top notch also. I definitely recommend trying this wonderful place.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Great place to work in the morning. Wifi is available and drinks are not that expensive. Vibe is cozy and colorful.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"I honestly never write reviews, but this was really really bad. The lavender oat iced latte didn’t taste like coffee at all. My friend and I couldn’t even drink it. It was thick like the syrup and grainy. We threw them away after a few sips. The vegan breakfast burrito was alright. The tempeh is not seasoned and I don’t even think it’s cooked? The vegan cheese wasn’t melted and the burrito was barely warm. I don’t know. Waste of money, especially with so many great food places around. I wouldn’t recommend. It made me sad."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,The food was OK. Wish they had more Vegetarian options.  I was looking for something a little more filling but  The croissant sandwich that I ordered was good.  I really liked the décor in the place. The staff was friendly. Overall I will definitely revisit this place and support this business.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,The employees are super nice and the food is great. The BLT is served with dutch crunch bread. I love their pastries and drinks. It feels super comfortable to sit inside but they also have a parklet.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,I enjoyed a really yummy carrot juice made in house. I liked how they had wifi and has a chill vibe to the cafe. Will definitely be back
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Overpriced. It's a business that has coffee for sale with other stuff; it is not a ""coffee shop"". Jack -of-all-trades would fit the description. On the menu is cappucino, boba milk tea, burritos, etc. The workers are playing loud music thats for them and their workflow. It is not ambiance music. The rating is for a discrepancy between ""coffee shop"" and what it really is. It's not a coffee shop."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"One of my favorite places to get coffee and a bagel before work! Plenty of great drink options to choose from, even if you dont like coffee. All of the staff members are wonderful as well, overall just a really nice place to go to for sit in or take out."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Drinks are okay but today I tried to buy a cup of ice they tried to charge $1.09 for this small cup of ice.. trying to take advantage of community.  So it's left a bad impression.  Especially since ice could of been needed for anything like injury with kid or even adult.  Insane to charge $1.09 for ice.  I wonder water they charge for a cup of water lol
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"I'm willing to pay $5 for a fresh-baked, bakery croissant, but not for a stale low-quality one -- took one bite and threw the whole thing out.  Server thought fresh meant just out of the microwave.  ""Drip"" coffee had a burnt taste.  ANY other coffee shop would be better than this one."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"This has become my go-to breakfast cafe in the neighborhood. They make quality breakfast bagels and burritos (and have a nice variety, not just one breakfast sandwich) for good prices. Nice ambiance for a straightforward cafe too."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Great coffee and breakfast spot on Valencia. Lots of vegan options, indoor + outdoor seating and friendly staff."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Cute little coffee shop. Nice staff. Nice seating and outdoor area.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Waited 15 minutes for an oatmilk latte that was just warm and seem to leave a lot of room for what, no cream needed for my latte.  When I asked the cool gal making drinks if there was a reason the cup wasn’t full, she said, ‘it depends’.  What?  Depends on how you’re feeling?  No thanks.  Super lame experience. Never again."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"I really love this place! I've gone a few times, and each time I've enjoyed my food and drink. Try their vegan breakfast burrito. I'm not a vegan, but decided to try it on a whim. I was pleasantly surprised. Also, there's space to work and the staff are super friendly! Prices are typical SF prices."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Cool little spot. Unfortunately I’ve had a few bubble tea’s before and this was just not good. Tapioca was horrible. I would have gone back to tell them and return it but didn’t have the time. Not worth the price.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Best coffee shop I’ve been to!!! Super cute, locally owned, women owned. Taste better than Starbucks, cutest little thing I’ve seen. Very detail oriented, too."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,I really want to support new small businesses but the quality and the prices don’t really match up. I got 2 iced lattes with an extra shot of espresso and it was over $15. Tasted like milk with a drop of coffee. The coffee flavor I did taste was not great. They made it so fast I don’t think the espresso was fresh. For that price it should be. The large size isn’t really that big for almost $7 after tax. I really wanted to like this place. Wishing them the best.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"I ordered an Americano with extra ice and a splash of oat milk from the shop, plus tax it was around seven dollars, the price was higher than listed on the menu, and the barista explained that it was because it was iced. Fine, but def not worth it. It was so watered down, I could barely taste the coffee, and the oat milk were very chunky, it was all concentrated at the bottom of the cup and looked really disgusting. I threw it away after the first sip. Would not recommend getting coffee from there."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Not very good, esp for the price. Small red velvet coffee was about $7 and it tasted meh… maybe I should try the bagel sandwich next time I’m in that neighborhood. The cafe felt more like a to-go spot; it’s small and dark. I wanted to like this place but was blinded by the cute aesthetics I saw on IG…I guess it’s true when they say don’t believe everything you see on the gram lol"
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"I was excited to try this coffee shop but was disappointed overall with the experience. The latte had an odd and off-putting flavor, and the vegan breakfast burrito took 20 min to get and was also underwhelming. Would have loved to see more fresh ingredients used in it."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,This is the best bagel coffee shop in SF. I’m an SF native who’s worked in a coffee shop and I always order take out. The lox bagel is always a 11/10 and their personalized packaging is so cute.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Needed to use bathroom and refill water bottle. Bathroom only available with purchase, that’s fine. So we bought a smoothie (not good). But they refused to fill our water bottle — would only give us a single cup of water “because they sell bottled water”.  It’s a wasteful policy and really left us with a bad taste on the entire experience."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Pleasantly surprised. Legitimately good breakfast options, and lunch looks good too. Much better than the previous coffee shop at this location."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Good coffee and nice staff. Wifi was great for working but sometimes a little loud and hard to do calls. Also got cold in there keeping the front door open but that’s probably just my preference. I would go back to grab a coffee and do some light work.
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Bad boba, bad service. Basically stealing money here. If you try to get a refund because of attitude you are receiving, even before they make your drink, will tell you their manager is gone so you can’t have one. So they force you to take their bad drink. Boba is gross consistency and costs $9."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,I order tamales to go. Very tasty
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Veggies were not fresh. Mushy tomatoes and Cucumber. I kinda want my money back. Very disappointing. In the past I got pastries, coffee and egg bagels, all good. But selling food that isn't fresh is a a deal breaker for me."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"This place is very chill. Great service, and great product quality. The customer service was superb! And this may be random, but their bathroom was VERY clean 👌🏾. Definitely will visit again when in the city. …"
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Great place to work, unlike some other coffee shops in the area! Good wifi, comfy seating, lit playlist, and plenty of outlets. Also, the boba tea is really good!!"
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,Bro tell me why there were chunks of straight PLASTIC in my smoothie⁉️
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"They provide free wifi, seating space indoors or outdoors, and there's a bathroom to use as long as you purchase an item from them. Very convenient food menu options."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Really nice place, people working there are super nice. We ordered a bagel and a sandwich and they were very good and filling 😊 …"
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Clean bathroom, lots of seating (indoor and outdoor), cute, playful vibe, and refreshing boba with interesting flavors."
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,A little expensive for the quality of food
Sisters Coffee Shop,920 Valencia St,"Attended the grand opening. Nice decor, good prices. Would give 5 stars but bathroom was out of order."
