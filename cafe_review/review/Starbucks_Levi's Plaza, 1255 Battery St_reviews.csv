Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","01/01/2023  This is by far my favorite location to go to and relax. I ordered my typical w White mocha and it was good. It just that for some reason there was sugar crystals inside my cup.  The seating outside is breathtaking and gorgeous, especially in the morning! The staff was so welcoming and friendly!  Overall, this is a nice spot to relax!  if you like for Thanks you for the nice experience ❣️"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",This Starbucks is so wonderful! The workers were so friendly and helpful- I placed my order at the wrong store by accident and they made it for me again! Absolutely incredible. In the past when I’ve come here everything has been speedy and delicious as well.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Standard Starbucks beverages. Great stop before the Alcatraz tour. Had to use the bathroom but like other businesses in the area, they’d rather you relieve yourself on the sidewalk than let you use their restroom."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Nice place to have a break before the Coit tower or after.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","The Shift Supervisor Nalinluck is amazing!!!! Great personality, great with customers. Im amazed shes not the manager!!! I met the actual manager and shes clueless and rude. Good drinks and great food. Thanks Nalinluck!!!"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Friendly and helpful staff. Gets busy around 9 ish, no public restrooms."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",1 Star 🌟 there is no rest room. …
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",The supervisor Nalinluck makes this store great. Her positive and uplifting personality makes everyone smile. She seems to know 99% of the people and takes the time to say hi and chit chat. She is the best.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Slowest place to get your coffee.  Lines move so slowly.  Order comes wrong.  In my case majority of time.  I ask for no foam but always there is foam -about an inch deep.  Aden was the only that had my order right. I'm not going back there ever.  Ordered six Croissants  to go.  Asked them not to heat it. They started to heat. Asked the manager place don't do it and just give me the ordered.  it took more five minutes to get that done.  each came in little bag.  The assistant asks me if I need a bag.  By than it is too late  for me.  Why not put it one bag initially.   I was not happy used the freaking service just sucks. Manger  comes out to talk to me.  Told her my history with this store. She told me not to talk to her employee that way. I really don't give a dam about it now.   I'm not going back there or any Starbucks.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Good Starbucks for business nearby, just lacks a washroom."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",There is always plenty of seats. However there is no restroom.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",The coffee could be better. But it was good price.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","All the Homeless people are there, the queue for the toilet is longer than the queue to place an order. Nasty place with always nasty tables. Dont go there"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Nice Starbucks experience, clean and not as busy as some other locations, great place to get work done and get exactly what you expect from a Starbucks."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Clean, cozy and easy place to sit outside to have a coffee. Unfortunately not open on Sundays and it's a hike to the next closest coffee shop"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","After 5 years, the customer service at this Starbucks is top notch. It’s even gotten better! When they make a mistake, they instantly give you a gift card and remake your drink. Super friendly staff and I’ve known most of them since I’ve lived here. When it’s open for inside dining, the atmosphere is homey and if you ask when you order ‘for here’, you can have your drink in a mug. Offering eco-friendly options is a plus and makes the Starbucks ambience even more home-like.  I can’t wait until they can open up again for inside dining and I can start having my matcha in a mug rather than paper cup.  For now, it’s still a friendly place to grab a matcha to go and a quick chat to brighten your day!"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",My favorite ⭐ Starbucks ✨ around SF 🤩!?!
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","I go to Starbucks all over the world for working, and when I need to eat or get something to drink. This place had a nice location but I found the service was less than satisfactory. The person that took my order didn't even look at me, growled when I asked for a small/tall. When my latte came they basically threw it  on the shelf for me to retrieve.  I don't think it was anything personal, just they were in their own little world."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Friendly staff, service was a little slow around 10am on a Monday which to me isn’t a typically busy time. No bathroom but nice seating area inside and out"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Useful if you have to work with your laptop. Nice and clean place. Good staff.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","What should I tell about Starbucks... Not a top location to be wandering around, but on the way to Alcatraz it was the best to take a little pauze. Quality was fine and the staff more than okay! Well worth to hop in!"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Courteous staff but terrible watery Americano. And please don’t give me two paper cups for each beverage I order. Starbucks claims to be sustainable!
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Good coffee but the waiting times are horrible, especially in the morning. Often times its faster to just stand in line than do a mobile order because the mobile order takes longer. I have to make my order in the bus on my way to the Starbucks and when I arrive I still have to wait 5-10 minutes for a cappuchino. A frappuchino takes even longer in the morning."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","The staff is rude and dismissive. Asking a simple, polite question will get you a dirty look. I understand that they deal with rude people during the day but that doesn’t mean they should be rude to every other paying customer as a result."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",The staff turnover is just annoying. Seems like this venue is used to train staff as far too often you see new faces. I paid for a cold brew only to find out 10-min later (only when I inquired) that the reason they hadn't served my coffee yet was that they had run out of cold brew. This is just ... Terrible operationally
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",This location get's 100% of all ordered Iced Tea Latte wrong at any given time. My last three never had milk in them when I arrived to pick them up. Today a colleague ordered one and he too didn't get any milk. Two stars for the fact that this is otherwise a seemingly functioning Starbucks location.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Ordered a mocha frappuchino which I assumed was going to taste like a mocha, instead it tasted like a chocolate milk with an extra dose of diabetes. The cup landed in the bin before I made it out of the store. Almost threw up my 1st sip."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Nice spacious Starbucks. No restrooms
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","I give them two stars because I don't truly believe they deserve lower than that. For the most part, the staff is friendly, and their drink accuracy is about 60/40 in their favor. That said, it's highly unlikely that I'll be visiting this location again, even despite their convenience to my place of work.  When ordering my drink this afternoon, a passion tea with apple juice, something I order every day...I requested it also be sweetened. The conversation that followed is my aversion to going back. Barista: umm, okay, you want that sweetened? Me: yes please Barista: okay, well you know the apple juice is already sweetened Me: yes I am aware... Barista: and you want more sugar? Me: that's correct Barista: okay so you want extra cane sugar in it...  That's when I walked out.  As a customer, having to repeat my order, multiple times, is aggrevating, yes, but I can put up with that. It's when the tone of your voice is degrading and judgemental to me, the customer; because, yes, I do want MORE sugar in my drink. Forget it, I'll take my business and my money elsewhere thanks.  I know that nothing will be done over this post, nor do I expect it. But, hey, Starbucks, as a former employee, maybe you should stop hiring people who don't give a damn; Who take attitude with your customers.  Thanks for saving me roughly $10 a day!"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Incredibly slow service, gave the cashier the amount due and he asked me count it for him, ordered a pink drink and only half an inche if liquid was added the rest was ice and water because the container ran empty."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",The one who serve me a coffee and chicken capress gave me the coffee like giving me free of cost with attitude and I ask for the milk and sugar but didn’t provided. But I got from another lady.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Garbage Starbucks. Maybe the manager should learn how to brew a drip coffee, have some brewed and ready to go. Pouring it as it’s brewing is not how it should be done. Starbucks standards must be falling."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Two times they messed up my chai latte. First time there was no sugar and then second time she put something in replacement of sugar that I didn't ask. even though I put a couple pouches of sugar I didn't get the taste that I usually to get.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Not the friendliest staff, odd atmosphere, smelt like moldy mop.  Would’ve gone somewhere else, but this was the only coffee shop open in the area."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Friendly staff, but no bathroom - reserved for employees only."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","The atmosphere in here is so weird. It felt like the staff were distracted by something. No eye contact, no please or thank you. Very odd."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Like any regular Starbucks. Long but quick moving lines, serving the regular menu. Not a fan of the wireless charging pads"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Very busy Starbucks down near the piers. They were out of dark roast, this minus 1 star. No public restrooms, so minus another star."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Decent store, conveniently located at the bottom of Telegraph Hill / Coit Tower.  Unfortunately no restrooms can be found here."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Staff don't let costumers use the bathroom, saying that is out of service all the time? So that means that the employees never use it? 🤔 …"
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",It's nice that this Starbucks actually has a lobby attendant for all of the mobile orders very helpful!
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","Picked up a white chocolate Grande with soy milk, very cordial people thanks guys. Friendly family atmosphere."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St","The WHOLE point of going to a Starbucks is being able to use the restroom, well, this Starbucks has none."
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Good safety protocol and allowed everyone space. The coffee was the standard Sbux.
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Place is so hot! Staff couldn’t care less. All the guest were either sweating or just walking out. Sad!
Starbucks,"Levi's Plaza, 1255 Battery St",Slowest store. Have waited 30 minutes in the morning and even 15 in the afternoon with an empty store. Drinks are usually made incorrectly and with poor quality.
