Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"We are on a journey trying every single restaurant/bar in Hayes Valley, and so far surprisingly, every restaurant we tried was all very good.  Walked in Hazie's in a Saturday afternoon at happy hour time without planning, and every item we ordered is all delicious.  We sit in the bar area by choice at 4 pm, it's 1/3 full, people kept coming after 5 & at 6, it's already packed.  Drink is exciting. Food is delicious. Service is good. Vibe is awesome.  Fun Fact: I ordered a drink ""Love your neighbor"" and my next door neighbor showed up all of a sudden and we ended up sit together and have great conversation. It's so magical.  Love this place, highly recommended."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"We love this restaurant/ bar! The food is yummy and a drink is creative to say the least. They have communal table with super friendly staff in a casual sports bar setting. It has a nice vibe but sometime can get pretty crowded, So we tend to go early before the dinner crowd start coming."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Fun ambiance and cocktails, excellent service, tasty food. At 6pm on a chilly, wet Saturday, we had drinks at the bar and were seated for dinner about 20 minutes later. We enjoyed everything our server recommended: kabocha tempura, ahi tuna poke, and duck carbonara. And I loved the shiitake cannelloni."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"A good place to have a good time. The drinks were exciting, affordable, and shareable. The food was one of a kind, delicious, and fast. We came on opening night and it was a great vibe and we hope to make it our go to spot for the neighborhood- it’s really the only bar that serves food nearby.  Get the “Go Ask Her” shared drink for fun with friends, and get the crispy wings for the best you’ll ever eat!  Update: a few months after opening it's still bustling, come early to get a table!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Came around brunch/lunch and was seated at the bar immediately. Didn't look too busy anyways. The vibes and aesthetics are good - lots of lighting, tvs, etc. But at that moment we were there I think the bar was understaffed so service was slow for all parties seated at the bar.  The food didn't take too long to come out though (once we finally had our orders taken). The food isn't very flavored or seasoned to be honest, but the portions are nice and the concepts are great. Just wish they weren't so bland (like the brisket sandwich thing, and also the stew thing).  Overall cool place to check out since it's in a nice location."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"We went for lunch and the food was good but not great. When I see a $20 burger or a fried chicken sandwich, I’m like, is it really 3x better than Popeyes or in and out (one third the price)? Answer to me was not really. I thought the salad, the latkes, and the fries were delicious though. I’d probably come back and try some other things on the menu."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Loved our brunch at Hazie's. We went because we wanted to try the restaurant that replaced the one that had been there previously which we used to frequent.  We were so pleased to see all the love put into the remodel and decor. And the food was absolutely fantastic! Best ever salmon Benedict - ever! The chef came out to say hello, the service was super attentive and personable without being intrusive. Pricing/value very good, which is a big deal these days, especially for the deliciousness.  Go to Hazie's, you won't be disappointed, and it's important to support neighborhood restaurants!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,A wonderful addition to the neighborhood given the recent closures. Nice that it is a bar that also offers food.   Still new so expect a few more changes to the menu and hopefully outdoor seating to take advantage of the SF late summer.   Highly recommend the ride the lightning cocktail.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Busy place, but nice vibes and good drinks & snacks to share. Had to wait a bit for being acknowledged by the bartender, also they had no spare menus, but we were fine just looking for one from our phones"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"This place is definitely one of my new favorites in SF. Drinks are fresh and unique, and the menu is inspired. There is definitely someone behind the menus who knows their food because it takes twist and turns in directions that you wouldn’t expect in the typical SF dining spot.  All around it’s certainly a delight. Make sure you stop by this place to give it a try."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Great catch-up/ meeting spot in Hayes Valley right next to Hayes Green from friends visiting the city - before hitting the happy hour scene though it's great any time of the day. Ample parking on parallel streets and some great spots in the vicinity. Looked more of the tech-bro crowd hanging about or Hayes Valley destination visitors.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,The food was outstanding as was the service. Prices were not bad. Chef Joey made visits throughout the dining room which added a nice touch. Can hihgly recommend.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Hazie’s  OVERALL - 5/5 Drinks - 5/5 Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Ambiance - 5/5  My friends son has just moved to this neighborhood, so we decided to meet them for dinner. Normally we just stay close to the Franklin/Hayes by all the performance venues. It was nice to step away and explore the area.  We ordered…  - ROASTED ECGPLANT WITH LEMON TAHINI - AMAZING!!! The fresh baked pita is to die for. The eggplant with sun dried tomatoes was yummy. Very unusual combination of flavors. - CRISPY CHICKEN WINGS - Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. - AHI TUNA ON CRISDY WONTONS - yummy - WILD MUSHROOM & RICOTTA CANNELLONI - Yummy - Halibut Special - The flavors were great but the halibut was overcooked and very chewy - Steak Special - Loved the flavors - Tiramisu for dessert - It was served layered in a very deep glass. Could not get to all the flavors at once. Did not enjoy eating all the flavors in turn.  Loved the glassware.  Will be back.  6-21-2023 - Dinner - Table for 5"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Walked by this bar and decided to try it, it did not disappoint! drinks were amazing! Super cute setup and great staff. Brian was the absolute sweetest. I had the naked & famous 10/10, espresso shooter 10/10 Will definitely come back"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Fantastic atmosphere. Food was good quality. Best beet salad I’ve had in a long time. This is a great spot for a date night or link up with friends before a night of fun. My group had dinner and dessert.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Great brunch spot! My pazole was fantastic. The wait staff was amazing, friendly and attentive. Definitely want to go back and try other dishes. I had a hard time choosing what to eat because so many things sounded awesome. The only thing didn't love were the beignets (kinda dense and hard), but I am not too mad about it. Place has awesome vibes."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Got some drinks and the pretzel knots! Just wandered into Hayes and thought we would give this a try. It has an upscale vibe but wasn’t crazy pricey. Nice views of the green and a very chic open layout. Really liked the cheese sauce for the pretzel knots and I felt the food was good quality! Would like to come try more of what they have to offer. One friend had the spark plug that he liked and another had the Harvester! (My friend from Germany was raving about the pretzels and cheese!)
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Feels slightly overpriced, but overall is a solid brunch experience. Lemon ricotta pancake is delicious."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Tasted good but small portion. Kinda over priced. Service not really good at entrance. Seems like she’s not willing to guide you in cuz she’s on her phone.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Hands down the beat Bloody Mary in SF.  The chilaquiles were exceptional and the smoked salmon with roe and creme fraiche dang delicious. Bringing the brunch scene to new levels.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Nice place nice vibe and good food! We turned up here on a week day and it was buzzing! I would go here again.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"This spot opened up on the corner where Stack's used to be right by the Parklet!  Came for happy hour, which has a good selection. Service was great, would def. come back!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Great location, ambiance, food and service. Love the outdoor seating. Croque madam and French toast were excellent."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Great atmosphere and location. The price of the drinks is good as well. However the food is expensive for what you get, and the cocktails are way too sweet."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Very disappointing top to bottom. It’s like a marketing manager decided to open a restaurant and bar. We first enter and are given some attitude for not having reservations, when the place has plenty of seating available. In retrospect, this was probably an attempt to build hype and anticipation. This became the theme of the night. The eclectic menu and decor seems like it could be great, a nod to nostalgia in the former location of the familial Stacks Restaurant, but the reality comes up short. The service was scatter shot— 7 different people came by and failed to serve anything on time. (1) The cocktails came after the food. (2) After waiting over 30 minutes and asking for our food, it came out as if it had been left forgotten until then. (3) We had to wait for our utensils after being served our food. Our wagyu steak frites came back over cooked and dry, and the uneventful (shredded) duck carbonara could be easily replicated at home. The Harvester was a competent gin fizz, but unremarkable. The Hat Trick was one note — smokey. One of the very apologetic wait staff informed us unprompted that we would be given a discount for these issues, which was kind, however no manager ever made themselves known. I am left with the impression that the mistakes were made before the doors ever opened as the menu is more than they can deliver. Maybe it was the delays and setbacks from lockdowns that have strained their budget, but they should focus on a smaller more modest gastropub offering rather than shortchanging and spurning customers. Mistakes happen and that’s ok, however there’s no excuse for the consistent lack of quality for the price, especially with so many great options nearby."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Great food and drinks held back by inconsistent and weird service.  I live up the street and have tried to like this place through 5+ visits but the service makes it impossible to give this more than a 3.  A few tangible examples: - Hostess wouldn’t let us sit until 5 and was very aggressive about that despite letting us sit at the bar at 4:45 - Happy hour only applies to the bar - Obvious distaste when we just ordered drinks and apps instead of meals at the table
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Decent bar. Good drinks. The hostess can often seem confused when it’s busy but if you can get a seat it’s a fun time. Good food too and centrally located. Fun vibe overall
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Unfortunately one of the worst dining experiences I’ve had in SF. We ordered 5 dishes for two people to share and all the food came out at the same time and the server moved another table next to us to fit the food (if the food doesn’t fit on the table maybe it’s too much food at once?). By the time we finished one plate the rest of the food was cold. The food that we did eat was mediocre at best. Drinks were fine, nothing special. Manager ended up comping two dishes that were cold and frankly just bad. Service inattentive and spotty. Came hungry, left hungry. Not worth it."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Had my wedding party here, and it was awesome. The amazing onsite team helped make sure everything was perfect, from amazing food to drinks throughout the night. Between an excellent location,  great internal vibe, tasty food and amazing staff, 10/10 would recommend."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Great for groups! Went here for a birthday dinner with 8 people and got a nice high top table. Saturday night was busy in a good way. Drinks were well priced. We got the Dazzler and Love your neighbor and both were great. My recommendations from the menu would be the preztel knots, hummus and guac app, salads and the ravioli. I won’t recommend the burger which was pretty expensive ($27 w/ truffle fries) and not very tasty. Overall a great time!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"We came for brunch at around noon, not a terribly busy time with open tables around the restaurant.  Service is atrocious. We were sipping water for 30 minutes after ordering cocktails upon arrival. When our food came 30 minutes later, there was no mention of the drinks so we asked about them and the staff immediately walked away without saying anything. They got one of our food orders wrong, so we mentioned this. We later found that the correction (due to their own mistake) resulted in an extra charge on our part (we originally asked for latkes as part of the dish’s included side, got fries, mentioned this was incorrect, then we were charged for the latkes at no fault of our own).  Quality is nice (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but service will have to take a 180 turn in order for us to return. Too many great restaurants in the area for such treatment."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Been here twice, both times left disappointed. Service is always a little iffy. Drinks are okay, small sizes but what else is new at restaurants. Some food menu items are good to great, some are average."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Really liked the vibe here! Food was excellent, drinks were good, prices were reasonable (for SF). The room is big but it wasn't overly loud. All in all a great new neighborhood restaurant, we'll definitely be back!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Great date night spot! Lovely atmosphere, had a lot of fun cocktails (and mocktails which was great for my partner who doesn’t drink), and the food was super unique and delicious. Wait staff was super attentive as well. Nice new addition to Hayes Valley."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,I absolutely love this place! I wish I took pictures but the food didn't last long on the plate. this is the perfect place for a cute upscale dinner.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Delicious interesting menu and cocktails
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Watched a girl with her service dog be removed from the bar and asked to sit outside by herself. Obviously staff don't care about their customers or understand service animal rights. Other than that, drinks were fine, not sure I'd come back."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Great interior design and a good menu.  Would love more vegetarian options besides ravioli.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,I have had brunch here twice and it’s really worth it!
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"This place is awesome!!! Great food, really great drinks, and fantastic service. Definitely snag a reservation because it's busy. Can't wait to go back!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Great place for dine in. Usually very busy so probably good idea to make a reservation. Cocktails were great and food was okay.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Cute ambiance but the food and drinks are overpriced for what you get. Confirmed after two visits.
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Went inside with service dog and was sent outside even though everyone acknowledged it was unfair discrimination and humiliating for me. My drink was also just meh and service was slow and unfriendly. Managers kept apologizing but what’s the point when they’re the ones who asked me to leave?
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Hazie's just recently opened in Hayes Valley ... We have been twice and both times have been excellent!! Food is delicious, service is really friendly, and the vibes are fantastic. I'm so glad a place like this is open in Hayes!"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Waiter was rushing us, he gave wrong recommendations - we felt like a burden Food was super expensive, super small plates and not that amazing Ambiance is nice tho"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"It’s basically a sports bar with bad drinks and food, both try to sound fancy so they can charge Hayes Valley prices. Service was terrible and ambiance was football and bros."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Tasty cocktails, bar snacks were pretty good but server seemed very distracted and service was very slow."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,Beautiful interior and great brunch!
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Consistently excellent, with a continually evolving menu"
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Sub par hotel bar food  Perfect for those networking tech entrepreneurs that don’t care for food, drinks, or culture"

Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Nestled in the San Francisco cityscape, the Hazies stands out as a true hipster gem. The atmosphere is both relaxed and trendy, with an eclectic decoration that evokes the charm of old bohemian bars.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a carefully curated indie playlist and friendly staff who seem to share a genuine passion for the place. The drinks, innovative and delicious, reflect the creative character of the bar. Each cocktail seems to tell a story, with bold and surprising blends that delight the taste buds.  What really makes the strength of Hazies is its ability to offer a unique experience, far from traditional bars. It is a place where you instantly feel at home, surrounded by people who share the same tastes and a certain vision of life.  Overall, I give Hazies a solid 5 out of 5. For anyone looking for an off-the-beaten-track night out in San Francisco, this hipster bar is definitely a go-to spot."
Hazie's,501 Hayes St,"Clean, cool and new place! I recommend!"
