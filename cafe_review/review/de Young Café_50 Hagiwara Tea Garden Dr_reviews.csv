de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Very nice museum restaurant with a menu that regularly changes. The food is consistently good and offers a variety of salads, hot sandwiches, pastas, stews, specialty entrees and desserts.  You can also select fancy prepackaged items. Wide selection of beverages including alcohol.  You order at the counter, they give you a number, you find a table, and the food is brought to you. Can get very crowded and I've heard people in line complaining about the prices, but I think it's worth it.  Beautiful views of the park."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"A bit pricey, but the meals I’ve had there are worth it. I believe the menu is revolving so may be hard to give a recommendation on what to get. Recently I’ve gotten the Berber Chicken Salad and it was worth it (great flavor and they didn’t skimp on the chicken!!)  Service was SO FAST! Could hardly believe how quickly our food came out despite waiting in a bit of a line.  Additionally, sitting outside makes for a superb experience. Love seeing the statues with my meal."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"It's a museum cafe which means they can serve mediocre food and over charge because it's a captive audience in a nice location. I ordered the ""Al's"" Chicago Beef Sandwich. $18.50. It was smaller than a 6inch Subway and 1/3rd as tasty. I don't mind small but for over $20 with tip it better taste good. Also ordered a latte which basically tasted like 100% milk 0% coffee. Add another $10 for this ""glass of milk"".  I should have walked out of the park. My mistake. Hopefully I'll remember next time."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Nice atmosphere. The menu options seemed plentiful. I attended during a field trip with a sizable crowd which made waiting times a bit excessive. Fortunately, I was pulled from line and serviced at another register. Thanks to the staff for THAT. I placed an order for braised coconut short rib. It was delicious 😋. I'd return for lunch definitely. Perfect date spot. Didn't realize until our departure but the Lobster Roll truck was parked on the outskirts of the parking lot. Not so great reviews but just an alternative option"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,$7.25 is an outrageous amount to charge for a 12oz coffee. Most places make their latte double shot anyways but you charge an extra $2. Complete robbery. Ruined my experience entirely. You're a cafeteria - not even a high end restaurant would gouge to that degree.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Had the macchiato with oat milk and extra shot of espresso. Very delicious, smooth and strong. A bit pricey for $8 but it's at a museum. They're working on bringing bags of McLaughlin Coffee in for sale because right now, they have their own special blend made for them."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"An update, 9/30/22, to the review posted 3 months ago:  Today we had a chicken-potato salad and a wonderful chocolate chip cookie, and strong tasty iced teas.  Everything was delicious.  *** Previous review:  We've had some nice meals at the de Young and the Legion of Honor, but our latest was so disappointing.  We ordered a salmon dinner and a bowl of corn chowder.  Both dishes were bland and featureless.  Sad, because we normally consider a meal and a glass or two of wine a lovely part of the museum experience.  We'll try again and hopefully have a better experience next time."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"For a cafe inside a museum they have a pretty good variety of fresh food options that cater to most diets. Prices are fair for San Francisco. I was excited to see they has hibiscus tea, but then disappointed that it was sweet without any mention."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,I was really surprised how delicious the salmon was! Great presentation too.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"The manager was incredibly short, rude, and disrespectful.  If you have any food allergy concerns of any kind, don’t step a foot inside this restaurant."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"The cafe isn’t worth it. We ordered 2 dishes. The meat and fish were cooked correctly but all the vegetables were not cooked at all. We ended up leaving half of our plates because we couldn’t eat all the big chunks of raw veggies. It’s very disappointing, especially since the menu is quite pricey."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Beautiful afternoon outdoor dining, a bottle of Russian River Chardonmay on ice, the Lentil Soup, mixed salad, and Beef Stew on rice pilaf - great meal, a little spendy, but general admission is free (for Bay Area residents) on Saturdays (parking is not!)"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,You really feel like you’re at a museum cafeteria. They nailed it!
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Had THE most delicious crispy tofu rice - rice noodle - grilled veggie salad!   I would eat it every day if I could.  Highly recommend!
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Nice cafe with a view, indoor and outdoor door seating, plenty of wait staff and free refill for tea! Good range of salads, sandwiches, hour and cold drinks. And if you want just a hard boiled egg, you can find it here too. Sure the prices are steep here, but which museum with captive audience don't do that? So if you want to economise, being a packed lunch to have on the beautiful lawns and seats then come in here for refillable teas."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Beautiful, empty patio, great place for an overpriced meal from a mediocre cafe while out for a walk with a dog, right? Wrong. No dogs allowed outside on the patio.  There are some great food trucks across the street!"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Food experience: overpaid for a latte. Said latte tasted like pure creamer. I'm not picky, but it was awful. Customer service experience: I warmly thanked the staff whom brought me my order. My thanks were returned with a dismissal grunt. Uh, what? I guess I didn't ""hate it,"" but this place pretty much sucks. I enjoyed the museum and surrounding area though."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Attentive staff gets you though the line quickly so don't be discouraged by the long lines.  There is outdoor seating in the sculpture patio or you can dine inside too.  When there is a busy show at the Museum, they set up extra tents during inclement weather to provide extra seating.  The seasonal menu changes regularly, and they offer quick grab and go foods in their refrigerator case. Good for kids and grandparents alike!"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"A tad pricey, but worth it! O e if the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had, pastry chef is incredible!!!!!"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Fantastic cafe in the midst of a museum. They always fresh ingredients for their dishes (the ones pre-made in the plastic containers are not as good, so select from the freshly made menu).  I have had their soup of the day - always amazing. the flatbread is excellent.  If it's not too cold, definitely sit outside in the sculpture garden - love the space!"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"A decent selection of food, although I could always use more vegetarian options, and a very nice spot to eat. Can be a bit on the pricey side, but if you're not wanting to pack a lunch, it's a decent option while you're visiting the museum. Eating in the outside area is quite lovely."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Great place to stop for a coffee or lunch while visiting the de Young. This cafe has great views and nice outdoor seating.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"de Young Cafè in the Golden Gate Park was one of the stops of our city bus tour. It's a nice enough place, nothing spectacular. We paid $20 for a pre-packaged turkey sandwich, which I shared with my husband and a cup of orange juice. Very overpriced. You'd be better off eating from one of several food trucks across the street."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,First a warning to visitors who don’t know the de Young Cafe system: in addition to their pricey menu you will be charged a surcharge which is a percentage to pay for their health insurance. Foreign visitors of course will also be surprised by the additional sales tax. I asked the cashier girl why the tax was so high and she still would not disclose the health insurance surcharge until I read my receipt - not very professional. It felt like she had intentions to deceive the customer. In terms of their food: it is just so so. I had a pre-made turkey sandwich. The french bread they used was tough at the least. Instead of lettuce they used shredded cabbage. I suppose it prevents the sandwich from getting soggy. I didn’t have the chance to try anything else because they were getting ready to close. Service was average. Most workers were not that into the job.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Back here again for quick lunch after visited the Museum for Monet’s painting.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"For one of the only places to offer food in the immediate area, it's pretty good. Selection of food will satisfy most, seating is plentiful and even faintly picturesque if you opt for a window or outdoor spot. Due to the monopoly of eateries in the park, it's naturally overpriced for what you get- which is likely my only gripe for this place."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"My Take: museum food that is actually pretty damn good | Went For: Sunday & holiday lunch | The Vibe: families welcome, day-drinking encouraged, desserts galore and art sculpture as a back drop | Special Dish: Duck Sausage over Pasta or daily soups | Avoid Their: Tuna Salad on old and nasty rye bread | Price Point: most well-sized dishes are under $15.00 | The Service: stellar all the way around | Reservations: n/a | FYI, FRIENDS: skip the inside seating, and soak up some arts and sun on their patio -- Eat up, Kimmie"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"This place should have 5 stars all the way. Good food, very pleasant staff, fantastic atmosphere, what else can you want. I think a lot of folks think that leaving 3 stars is a good review... no its not! If you leave 3 stars it means there is something wrong with the place. (sorry for the rant)"
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Quick service. Good atmosphere. Free self serve water.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,The window seats are fantastic. The atmosphere is nice. However my chicken wrap was $10 and that ain't cool.  Food is way overpriced... And not all that tasty
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Not bad food at all but a little pricey since it's a captive audience.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"New cuisine to test but also all kind of commons stuffs. Try the raspberry soup which is very tasty. The ambiance is nice too.  If you don't want to test, don't go there, nothing great to see."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Nice & cozy but coffee tastes is not very good.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,The atmosphere was nice the manager had a bit of an attitude but it is in a wonderful museum.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"I would like some plainer selections.  It was a little too exotic for me.  Good pastries, though."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Amazing courtyard but the coffee was made with what looked like an instant coffee machine. Don’t call yourself a cafe if you don’t have proper baristas
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"A good place to eat while in the park. A good selection from quick sandwiches to full entrees. No table service. Bright, open cafe with nice views of museum grounds."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Sandwiches were very tasty. A little pricey,  though."

de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Good way to get a break between art viewing. Noon could be pretty crowded, go earlier or later to skip the line."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Food was decent but overpriced and coffee took forever to prepare. Staff was horribly rude to customers.

de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Great food in a lovely setting
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Ramses The Great
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,The only thing that was good was that the food came quickly. Otherwise very high prices and not appropriate for the quality of the food (canteen food). Penne was cooked totally soft and the pasta salad was not appetizing either.
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"It doesn't sound like a meal, but it's good to take a break while drinking coffee after visiting an art museum."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"The terrace overlooking the sculpture garden is something special. Here you can relax and recover from sightseeing. That's right, the prices are high. But the environment makes up for it completely."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,"Nice outdoor space for fine dining right in the middle of Golden Gate Park.  Impeccable service, large area protected from the rain thanks to the beautiful Swiss architecture of the De Young museum.  Fresh seafood. Among the best prawns I have eaten. Good little starter of prochuto, asparagus, cheese served like a small refined pizza. A little disappointed with the macaroons.  Excellent view, glorious sunshine, a great way to start our week in San Francisco."
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,Very rich
de Young Café,50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr,View Ramses II collection 🥰🥰🥰
