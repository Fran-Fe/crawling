Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Came here super early and there was basically no wait. Order was taken and came out real quick. Location is pretty chill and the staff was kind and allows dogs to chill inside.  Got a mint mojito and it was tasty. Very unique drink and worth the try if you've never had.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"They keep the doors open so I was slightly taken aback by the 2-3 flies that fluttered away when I went near the cashier. I usually get the Philtered Soul, and the taste was consistent with what I got before at another Philz coffee location.  They have a lot of seats, but this location is on the slightly smaller end."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Philz used to be one of the top coffee spots for me but as they got bigger….Coffee runs the gamut of amazing—so-so to downright bitter (excellent most of the time but it should be excellent all the time—do not always have the option of getting it re-made due to time).The staff is super friendly and helpful.The space is clean and well-maintained.Delicious pastries. ❤️Philtered soul and Dancing water
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,I love my coffee Black. Ty
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Either gave me the wrong drink or that was the worst Tesora I've ever had. LA Phils coffee has way better quality than the SF one.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"This Philz isn’t so spacious, but it has some outside seatings. Also, as same as other locations, their WiFi is good. Of course, the taste of coffee is certainly Philz!! One good thing is this location isn’t so crowded compared to other Philz. When you go to the ball park (AT&T Stadium), this location is nice to stop by. Staffs are always nice and helpful to choose your coffee!!"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Excellent Coffee! Some of the best coffee I have ever had and the staff was extremely nice and helpful.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,It is my favorite coffee for this time visiting SF. Its Mint Mojito and Sooo Good are the most special flavors I have ever tried before! I love the strong taste of mint. Highly recommend you MUST try these two flavors!
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,My go to is a nice hot Mint Mojito. Warms my soul! Cops come here in the afternoon and the seating gets somewhat limited. A few desk areas and outlets if you want to bring your laptop. But don't come here to work if you break out in dance when some good music blasts the stereo. Drank so fast I forgot to take a decent photo!
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"The driver pops out of Philz, I said ""you are literally parked next to a sign that says 'no stopping, tow away.' They can tow you."" The driver tells me, ""yeah, whatever."" The whole ally next to this truck had parking. Wreckless employees."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Great coffee, good pricing, very friendly staff! Indoor/outdoor seating is limited (even for pre-pandemic times) but definitely a great place to get a coffee for your walk around Oracle Park!"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,This Berry St. location is fantastic. Very friendly staff and always good coffee.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Highly recommend the almond croissant
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Very nice and cozy place and very young and energetic baristas. I ordered hot mocha and it feels so good drinking it specially with a beautiful view of king street and very calm neighbor. Totally recommended.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Fast service. Clean bathrooms. Friendly staff. 1lb coffee freshly ground $20.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"The ladies we’re great, very sweet and friendly! The coffee was delicious, amazing oat foam. I think it is worth the price! Definitely going back, one of the best Philz locations😋 …"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Always amazing, just the best coffee around even in SF with a boutique roaster on every corner. Personal fave is Jacob's Wonderbar, black or Philz' Way, can't go wrong."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,I have to give the service a three-star I really don't go to Philz coffee but it was cold it was raining I need something hot something warm I was freezing I had no sweater they have on display a sweater and a t-shirt they refused to sell me their last sweater why have on display something for sale that you don't have and you refused to sell your last one...
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Coffee is okay but service can be a hit or miss. This is the only coffee shop in SF I keep having these awkward moments with the cashier and baristas all the time. One time I told them my name is John (my Starbucks name for convenience) and the coffee came named for ""sheik"", and I can only hope that it was an honest misunderstanding and not a reference to my accent."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Unique coffee selections that were delicious and very welcoming staff.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,I got the coffee that has a hint of hazelnut.  I got it iced sweet and creamy and man is this worth it. You should definitely try this if you like hazelnut when you’re in San Fran! The blend is called Philtered  soul.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Stopped for a quick coffee. Fast, friendly service"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Considering how long of a wait some of the Philz can be it was very quick and very tasty. It's not the most comfortable or nicely decorative environment but hopefully they'll change that soon?  Outside seating is a plus and staff are nice and very much good all around folks, but please just make it more welcoming and cozy."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,The place to be... For delicious made to order coffee!
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"This place is STILL here after all these years! Yay, my coffe shop b4 the Caltrain stn. I couldn't get down to 22nd Stn bc the 22 Fillmore got rerouted after all these years. The 55 the newest line now goes that way. I am so confoozled, so thank GAWDAH for this Philz. I used to live in the park across the bridge b4 gentrification b4 the Ball Park was built and they bulldozed my parkinf lot at South Beach behind thr IBEW."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"I ordered ""Mint Mojito Iced Coffee"". It was nice."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Great cinnamon rolls (must tolerate raisins, and get it heated) and curated coffees and coffee drinks. Apparently easy to preorder and just breeze in to pick up but I didn't do that. Good croissant and blueberry muffin, too."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"The iced mocha is absolutely amazing! Their baked goods are equally good. Starting from the best : Poppy lemon slice, mini banana loaf, chocolate croissant, butter croissant, soft pretzel, seasonal fruit danish."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Understaffed and overwhelmed. I waited 34 minutes past my mobile order pickup time. The order was comped but the wait time was unacceptable.  Edit: upon looking at my receipt, it turns out the order was only half comped. This place can’t even compensate correctly."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Philz is great.  I love this spot. Been coming here for years, it's right next to work. The staff is real friendly, and gives great recommendations.  They've been quite accommodating and safe throughout Covid as well. Their app is my prefered form of ordering at this point. I just order what I need while riding the T-Line to work, and it's usually ready earlier than predicted.  One of the many great places to get coffee in Mission Bay."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Nice clean place excellent selection of coffees
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Incredible, warm,  generous service makes the over the top, delicious coffee in all combinations unique to each visit even better.  If you like coffee and love warm, personalized, service and attention to detail,  get yourself to a Philz. Pro tip: Bring your own cup and pay for a small."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Lovely staff, great atmosphere! Baristas were really pleasant and welcoming. You can’t go wrong at Philz"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Great coffee and pastries, their baristas will do their best to make the coffee just the way you like it."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,Not a good experience at this location. I go in and get my Mocha Tesora coffee. When I receive it. The drink taste like water. When I tell the guy at the register. He argued with me about the taste. This is the drink I get everytime I go to Philz coffee. So they make it again and taste like sugar water. Disappointing. Didn't want to waste anymore time. Just no going back to this location
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"This is my first cup of the deliciousness called Philz Coffee! I've been in the Bay for 6yrs.... Why ever did I wait so long? The Mission Bay  location sits right on the corner and had cool vibe upon entering. The baristas were helpful and friendly. I also added an Almond Croissant, which of course was the perfect compliment. We need more locations in the E. Bay!? Overall I'm pleasantly pleased that my ""first"" time with Philz was pretty painless and felt really nice😜"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"I love Philz, and this location is no exception. Conveniently located by the Caltrain station, Mission Bay, China Basin, and public library, so a lot is at your fingertips!  Definitely worth a stop if you're on the hunt for caffeine. Philz is always my first choice for chain coffee when it's available.  I'm not a tea drinker but I have heard from my tea-drinking friends that their Chai is good. And of course the coffee is stellar and freshly-made! My go-to blends are Dancing Water, Tesora, or Mission Cold Brew."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Philz Coffee is a great place to grab a quick, delicious breakfast. The baristas are friendly and the environment is open and appealing. It was clean and well kept despite being busy in the morning. I don't know about all of the items on their menu, but the sweet, creamy hot chocolate and cinnamon rolls are delightful."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"They have a great app for ordering, staff are always friendly. The turkey sausage egg white breakfast muffin is awesome. I think their food is a bit pricey but still a great place."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Philz is the indie coffee shop closest to Caltrain station. I know there is another big brand coffee place (with a mermaid logo) nearby too. But by choice, I support smaller businesses. Local businesses are a priority for me. Philz offers wacky combinations of coffee beverages. I can get a simple tea 🍵 too; which I like. Sometimes you need a beverage to stay hydrated, to quench your thirst after your walk or run along King Street. Or sip a drink while watching the water flow by along the channel. Matcha tea is healthy. I like that it has green caffeine too. Most of the time rushing to/from Caltrain I don’t take my eye off getting from A to B. Those rare times I get to the area early, I’ll pop into Philz. A chill vibe. Good drinks. Snacks or even healthy food. A good choice."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,great coffee makes up for mediocre food
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,This very location was my introduction to the world of Philz. Never knew coffee could taste so flavorful. Reading their menu board is like reading descriptions of fine wine. I had my very first Mint Mojito here - mint really goes well with coffee. This place has indoor and outdoor seating and can get really crowded with AT&T Park and Cal-Trains within walking distances besides all of the apartments and condos surround it. The staff is friendly and will make you a new coffee if you don't like what it tastes like.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Tried the famous Mint Mojito. Umm, it's not coffee just a sugary drink"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,The Philz Coffee on Berry is awesome!  Lots of interesting and delicious choices for coffee.  Plus the staff are super friendly and dedicated to making sure every customer enjoys their drink.  Great place to work or hang out.  Definitely coming back.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Order your coffee in advance through the app :)   Great coffee choices, friendly staff, and a fun clean little shop make this one of my favorites in town.  The line is no worse than your average star bucks but their pour over coffee here is usually much better.  There isn't a ton of seating so don't count on getting a spot."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,I love Philz.  It is my favorite thing about visiting my family in the bay area.  The coffee is so fresh!  The service is what you would expect from a coffee shop!  They have pastries and will warm them up for you!  Some coffees have MINT.  FRESH MINT!  Thank you Philz.  Bless you Philz.  Marry me Philz.
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Great, friendly service and tasty coffee. I walked up to the bar and hadn't decided what to get and asked for a quick recommendation. The barista was super friendly and she told me what her favorites were. I got the Philtered Soul and when she was done brewing it, she told me to taste the bubbles and let me know what I thought. It was a great tasting coffee, though I think it was flavored, which I wasn't expecting. Either way, I was really pleased with my order and the service!"
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"Awesome drip-only coffee place. Definitely a bit different than the other, more typical espresso - centric places in the area. They have lots of choices (I got the Philtered Soul)  and I definitely plan to go back so I can try many of the other ones. The service was also great, and they made sure I was happy before I walked out."
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,I feel like it's a reward to myself everytime I step in this coffee shop.  I love their coffee! They have a long selection of roasts for you to choose from.  If your barrista does not make it the way you like it he/she will do their best to try to make it your way. This place rocks!
Philz Coffee,201 Berry St,"The guy who made my coffee made it so hot it burned my tongue and started leaking through the bottom of the cup as I walked back to the office. In addition to that, the guy who took my order was wearing a hat that said ""BIP CITY"".  ""Bipping"", if you did not know, is a slang term for the act of breaking into a car with a ""bip tool"" (an escape device used if a car were to go underwater) to shatter the window and steal the valuables inside.  Given that Phil is from the city of San Francisco born and raised,  you would think that he would not want an employee of his, who is a representative of his brand, associating them self with that lifestyle which has been such a stain on the beautiful city & culture of San Francisco.  How disappointing."
