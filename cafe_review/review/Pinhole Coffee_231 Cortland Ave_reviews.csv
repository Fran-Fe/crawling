Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Great place with delicious coffee and a super cute and warm ambiance! Baristas are welcoming and know what they're doing with their latte! Try their special Shortstack drink, it's so unique (custom recipe by them) and tasty!!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Really comfortable coffee shop with great espresso drinks and nice social setting. Ambience is perfect to meetup with someone for coffee. Not really a working place.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Coffee smells great! Eating a ginger muffin in a cozy space will make you happy.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Visited upon the recommendation of a family member and found it a gem of a coffeeshop. On top of the excellent sourcing/brewing of the coffee and the quite flavorful pastry, what really got me was the high level of service.  For example, on top of the normal pleasantries I was given a time expectation for my pour-over and a small cup of drip to ease the wait.  Will definitely be back whenever I’m in the city."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Love the coffee here. The baristas are very talented. No one seems to be overly friendly lol but they are good at what they do. Great new parklet outside.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"I just had a Dill swiss biscuit here and I think I just don't like dill because other than the butter flavor I was getting in my biscuit it was made to perfection.  I didn't have coffee because my just can't deal with caffeine but the coffee smells really good, so much that I am almost tempted to take it."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Phenomenal multi-roaster shop in all measures. Neighborhood charm with a modern but cozy and interesting aesthetic (ie, feels good to hang out - the local neighbors are!), great selection of top local coffee, and maybe most importantly staffers who are nice and have the skill and knowledge to prepare their product. They get the most of the beans, which I appreciate hugely!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"1st visit, best coffee in recent memory. Ethiopian Gelgelu pour over. Sweet citrusy aroma, taste matched (rare for me with coffee, wine..). Matcha scone was amazing, not too sweet. Love the fitout & atmosphere - lacquered raw wood seats, bench. 🌈 Polaroid inspired colors. Friendly staff. No WiFi. …"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"I was going to write a long review about how awesome it is to have a truly neighborhood cafe where you run into friends and chat in line with strangers, but I just discovered their greatest secret attribute: Pinhole gives you a free taster of coffee to sip on while you wait for your pourover. Can life get better? I submit it cannot."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"I’m breastfeeding so I can’t have much caffeine, but they have a decaf latte and it’s AMAZING. It’s a life saver for mommas with babies who miss coffee. Also there’s great service and a chill atmosphere, it’s a little full but everyone’s pretty respectful."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Super cute ambiance but the espresso isn’t how I like. It has a sharp bitter flavor and I prefer a smoother taste
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Neighborly chic vibe, great coffee, scrumptious pastries, see you next time."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Delicious coffee and staff who knows how to use almond milk. Super cute and cozy atmosphere, love the live-wood coffee tables. Delicious mushroom & cheese croissants."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"So lucky to have Pinhole in the neighborhood! I’ve worked in specialty coffee for a decade and their quality is consistently some of the best in the city. Great baristas, lovely parklet, nice people watching! On top of that, I appreciate how the owner JoEllen goes out of her way to make people feel welcome and appreciated. Worth going out of your way to check it out!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Cozy little coffee shop in Bernal Heights. Perfect place hangout with friends.The coffee is amazing and the baked goods are yumm. Be prepared for some line early morning.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Love the decor. Got a latte with whole milk and it was properly pulled. No bitterness at all, as it should be."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Delicious coffee with nice atmosphere
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Love Pinhole coffee amazing cortado and everyone there was so nice went with my 4 year old son and the staff offered him a kiduccino. I had never heard of that and he LOVED it.  Thank you Pinhole crew!!!!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Good coffee and warm staff is a winning combination
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"A nice, small coffee place with friendly and smiling staff and very nice atmosphere. I ordered Matcha latte and a muchi chocolate donate which were ok. Small disadvantages, to my opinion, are lack of wifi and not enough seating places."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Excellent chai latte, teas, and pastries, all served with care by friendly staff in/on interesting locally made pottery. The cafe has an interesting inviting atmosphere that's miles away from a Starbucks. Despite the lack of wifi, I've decide this is the best cafe in Bernal Heights."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,One of the best coffee places I've been in San Francisco. The coffee has amazing quality and it is made with love. The mix of wooden and metal decoration make it modern and inviting. Definitely a must visit!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Lovely artsy coffee shop where you can hang out or have your own corner. It’s always a good day at Pinhole Coffee!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Well crafted third wave coffee with outdoor seating.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"I'm staying in the neighborhood for a week and this became my daily fix immediately.  It's tiny, with simple coffee choices and a few tasty bakery items. Don't go expecting a full blown breakfast menu and fancy, sweet drinks like those chains.  But go. And expect wonderful, smooth coffee, prepared exactly as it should be. I could drink their cappuccinos all day if it wouldn't give me a heart attack."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Iced Black coffee = $3.80 with your own cup discount! Great smooth feel, a little fruity/bittersweet for my taste preferences but still great. And can’t beat the beautiful interior and sleepy-yet-inviting Bernal morning neighborhood vibes!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Amazing coffee, quirky interior and super COVID-friendly staff!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"A very cute place with great coffee. The Mochi muffin is very good, and the everything-croissant too. A really nice spot to visit when taking a trip to Bernal hill."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Delicious pastries....awesome coffee...and the best staff! Combined with a community, chill space. Definitely a great find in Bernal Heights!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Great latte and bottomless coffee (for here) if your looking for a sit and work/read place.  Had a hard time finding an outlet where I was working, but forced me to read instead 😀 …"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Fun, stylish little place in Bernal - love the cute ceramic mugs. Had an amazing mochi muffin and delicious cappuccino. Great for catching up with friends or reading at the window bar."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Friendly staff, hole-in-the-wall location, unique decor, is all let down by barely drinkable coffee. A large $6 mocha is a 12oz, I'd hate to see what the small was, and that tastes like any generic coffee and a iced latte that was basically just a iced milk.. Half way through and there was no reason to finish as it was just milk."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,A lovely neighborhood coffee shop . Great coffee and friendly staff. No access to WiFi though. Bring your books with you !
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,I finished my pour over several hours ago but I'm still thinking about it. I had a fantastic cup of coffee this morning at Pinhole. So good that in going to come back to try to buy those coffee beans for my at-home brewing. I really enjoyed the coffee I ordered.  Also a cool little shop. They have a parklet outside that you can enjoy your drink (currently not allowing people to consume inside).
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Pinhole Coffee is hands down my favorite spot in the city. I lived down the street pre pandemic and looked forward to seeing the staff and enjoying an excellent espresso and pastry.  If you're in the area, or not, I can't recommend Pinhole enough. Warm vibes, friendly staff and great coffee."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Loved the piccolo latte and the affogato!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"My favorite coffee shop!!! Started going before the pandemic when I moved to the neighborhood in 2019, and the staff, coffee, and community of customers were so great I just kept hanging out there. Throughout the pandemic JoEllen has always put the safety of her staff and community first, you can tell she really cares. And through all of that the cafe feels tapped in to which small roasters are putting out great beans, and does justice to them with great barista-ing. I recommend Pinhole to everyone. 💜💜💜"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,This is my favorite coffee shop in SF. Their drinks are phenomenal but also the staff is so down to earth and lovely. They now have a parklet where people gather and chat. A welcoming and wonderful spot hidden up in Bernal.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"I really just did not get this obvious local favorite.  They only allow one person to enter at a time due to COVID. One person and your dog, if you have one. They had a tea selection and my friend enjoyed his coffee. They had some cookies but not really any additional food items. The staff wasn't particularly polite or impolite, more just caught up in whatever was going on with themselves.  I sat out front for about 2 hours chatting with my buddy, and the place does business. Again, all locals. I think they go there because there's not much other competition in walking distance."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Excellent coffee selection, very friendly staff, and good pastries. Dry the pour over, worth the wait."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"This place is a gem. After working in coffee for 10+ years- I have seen some things! And Pinhole is one of my favorite spots in the City. Their espresso is excellent, and they put a lot of care into dialing in their shots every day. Milk textures by drink type are always on point. They have creative local pastries- and let’s not forget they were a lot of people’s first taste of Midnight Bagels! I also want to specifically call out their house Masarap beans- sooo good for brewing at home. Last but not least, in a sea of coffee shops that are basically coworking spaces- they blissfully don’t offer wifi. Instead, at Pinhole you get art, neighbors mingling, and the most wonderful feeling of an actual community gathering spot. It’s the real deal."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"I’ve lived in SF for over a decade and have been to pretty much every coffee shop you could name and this is by far one of the best. So many of the even reputable coffee shops in the city you never know what you’re gonna get in terms of quality, but I have never had a bad latte here."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Oat milk wasn't great, customer service was alright, but they didn't allow time to look at their specialty items due to trying to get people in& out. Almost bought a bag o' beans. 🤷🏻‍♂️  Edit: To the Pinhole Coffee owner: I did not perceive anything in any other way than what it was. Thank you for patronizing my experience, will not be coming back. For the future, and for the sake of other customers, maybe have your crew ask if customers would like to have a look around before shoo'ing them out. Consider changing your oat-milk, too. Best wishes.  Edit pt 2: owner deleted their comment. they pretty much tried to gas-light me. all good though, found new favorites. 🤙🏽"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Unkind people working  12/12/21 Improving my review to make it more constructive— Seems like this place has a lot of loyal customers. As a previous patron wrote, for COVID they let one party in at a time (which I can understand) so there is a pretty long (and slow moving) line. I guess the bummer is that when you get in there the staff is sort of impolite and short and I perceived that they felt it was a chore that they had to attend to customers. My suggestion would be to focus a little more on basic customer service— eye contact, greeting with smile, etc :) Good coffee. Thank you!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Nice cafe with relaxing atmosphere and friendly people. I have ordered Cortado and it taste very good, I would give them 5 star if the coffee was a bit stronger and less milky. They also have some pastries and tea options in the menu. Highly recommended and would come back"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Good coffee, mochi donuts and ginger scone. Chai was a bit watery."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Awesome cappuccino and really good croissants here. Staff is friendly and the place has a small-town feel for a big city, which is nice. Prices are moderate to high, but if you want good coffee in SF, you can't be cheap!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Pinhole is my go-to for coffee!! 🥰 Their coffee (beans and drinks) is incredible. Everyone is so friendly and knowledgeable. And my kiddos and I live in their merch. We can’t get enough!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,This corner of the Earth is special. Is it the coffee? Is it the people? Is it the art? Is it the Muni tokens on the beautiful tile floor?  It’s all that and thensome. I like my coffee tall dark and handsome.  Love to the whole pinhole crew.  Act like you knew.  Besos y abrazos
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"LOVE this place. Definitely the best coffee shop in the Bernal Heights area. I'm usually obsessed with unique flavored lattes but Pinhole's unflavored, unsweetened latte hits the spot despite that. Also super covid friendly."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Very thoughtful and cute queer woman (qwoc owned) coffee shop with delicious baked goods. Really sweet lowkey neighborhood feel with a fun energetic vibe. The drinks are great (the matcha and coffee are top tier), the owner is rly cool and very into the local small business community in bernal. And right near historic lesbian bar Wild Side West. A great shop with an important place in the bernal/sf community- you have to see it!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Excellent coffee, friendly and skilled baristas giving great service - a micro-community in a special neighborhood."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Literally the best coffee and most skilled baristas in Bernal Heights
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Love Pinhole coffee and vibe - it’s made our five years in Bernal feel like home. I also think the coffee is better than Sightglass or Ritual - it’s stronger and nuttier (they use Linea).
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Went to this cafe seeing the great reviews.The decor is cute, coffee average  and  the staff very curt and grumpy."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"This cafe is SUPER cute, with lots of wooden decor (including tree stump tables), and bright colors on the walls. Friendly to both kids and dogs, their coffee selection was big enough to find your favorite drink, and definitely classy. My Columbian pour-over and my boyfriend's decaf cappuccino were both delicious! The baristas were very friendly, as well. 10/10 would recommend."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Coffee is good, staff is friendly, and it's a great place to meet the neighborhood! They have pastries of all sorts from Kahnfections and Wholesome Bakery."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,What a perfect cup of coffee!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"GREAT customer service. Joseph is the best! Definitely try their Sweet cream affogato! They serve their coffee in beakers. Cute little place in Ktown. The boyfriend and I haven't had one complaint about this place! Tonight we tried their Testing - mad for caffeine which is their coffee sampler! They offer $1 validation. Parking is tight. We walked here. They have free wifi. They have a lot of seating, chairs sofa and stools. Clean restroom."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Fun, colorful, clean coffee place. Bit busy, but service very fast and friendly. Coffee quite good, baked goods excellent too. Fun apparel, and kid friendly. Kidduccino.. haha.."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Such a genuine coffee experience! We got the matcha latte (with oat milk) and a mocha (whole milk) and both were rich and creamy, perfect temperature too. The mocha wasn't super sweet and the matcha had that kind of bitter flavor at the end.  The staff were all welcoming and you could tell they love their customers. It's not a very big Cafe so I could see seating getting taken up quick during busy hours. Great Cafe for littles--lots of toys and what not."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Best coffee shop in San Francisco! They make you feel part of a community here.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Great place full of locals. Excellent coffee. Yummy pastries.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Super popular neighborhood coffeeshop. Every weekend there's a line around the corner. They're very orderly with their queue and ordering/checkout. If the line is really long sometimes they have someone come out to take orders and pre-prep the drinks so it's ready quickly. I usually get a regular latte, but an occasional matcha affogato is a great treat."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Cute coffee shop that also sells t-shirts and gifts. There are few seats outside and a great sandviches next door. Great for a pick at the park a block away.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Coffee is very good, the owner and her family? And staff were all extremely nice. This is a very home..y feeling place where the locals in the neighborhood seem to go. I'll definitely stop back by in my next trip to town."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"It's a cool neighborhood coffee shop. Great ambience, nice baristas, and pretty good coffee. I also appreciate their off-the-beaten-path pastries collection. The last time I was there I had a pretty tasty ube (purple yam; it's kinda like taro) custard cake."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Disappointed with both the cappuccino and the cortado. I don’t know why but the espresso tastes burnt and dusty. Extremely cute shop decor though I guess
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Extremely cute coffee place with very nice people working there.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Been here a few times but their coffee, espresso and pastries were hella good and flavorful everytime. Went in today to get some coffee to take home, and even if it was quite busy everyone was nice (as always) and killin it behind the bar. Overall, this is a great place to hit up."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Best coffee in Bernal, and good small breakfast options."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Sweetest little cafe with great espresso drinks and tasty treats. There’s a reason this spot is so beloved by the neighborhood!!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Amazing cappuccinos in a lovely spot welcome to everyone.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"My favorite coffee shop in the city; we come here every time we are in town. Great coffee and pastries, super friendly neighborhood vibe.  The perfect place to start the day."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Very cute cafe. The staff was very inviting. It's good if you want to unplug especially or catch up with a friend. There is no internet or readily available plugs so if you want to work you might consider somewhere else.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Best coffee shop in SF. The staff is friendly and helpful. Most of the baristas can even make latte art in almond milk and it's never burnt. The chocolate for mochas is actually a melted chocolate product not some crummy powdered substance. Super kid friendly too if you have little ones. And they have dog treats for your four-legged friends - and a water dish outside as well. Still amazing coffee shop, that now carries Pacific barista oat milk."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Decent coffee for a neighborhood place. Not on the same level as local roasteries like Andytown or Sightglass (I think they stock Verve or similar here). Always polite, quick service."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Great coffee, awesome staff, and fun little shop. You won't be disappointed. I live about 10 min away and I make this a frequent stop when I need a good latte or drip."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Hands down pinhole coffee has the best pick me ups in Bernal Heights, as well as some of the best pastries. The cappuccinos are IMHO without local comparison.  Full disclosure (I have a small crush on the owner/espresso wizard) and I used to be a die hard Sand Box cafe fanboy until they sold out to Pinkies.  I still love the original owners pastries when she occasionally shows up with some of her finest.  Great success to Pinhole!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Lovely coffee spot!!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Excellent local coffee shop. I'm super picky about coffee and I'm thrilled that this place is nearby. Their baristas are unpretentious and talented, and their rotating selection of roasts for pour-over is seriously on point."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Fantastic espresso, knowledgeable and friendly staff, good selection of beans! Love it!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Another gem in the Bernal neighborhood. If you appreciate a good pour over coffee, you must go here. When I moved first to SF, many folks pointed me to Blue Bottle, Philz, etc but I never really enjoyed them. You gotta find these small little gems who are taking the coffee game to the next level but at the same time feel very neighborhoody. Don’t forget to ask for the punch card as their coffee is seriously addictive."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Cute coffee shop in Bernal! It was pretty late in the afternoon when I went, so I ended up getting tea. They serve teas from Red Blossom Tea Company, and I ended up getting the Elderflower tea, which was refreshing and delicious. The baristas there are super friendly, and it seems like a great neighborhood spot where people stop by for a quick cup of joe or to catch up."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"It was an ok come thru...ended up at a joint down the street.  Lines were to long /  UPDATE FROM RESPONSE: yea no worries, the other place was awesome.  We'll just go there next time also. 👍"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Good coffee in the Bernal Heights area that is really good for kids. Small space but good coffee. If you are lucky enough to get parking on Cortland, you win life."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Good coffee, cold, curt, rude staff. Bummer."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Really nice coffee and friendly staff, although there could be a more extensive range of food. The blueberry and oat muffins were both lovely and moist."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Excellent cafe that makes excellent espresso and supports the LGBTQ community. If you want something a bit different and stronger, get the Picollo! It's basically a Gibraltar/Cortado."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Wish there were more seating but otherwise it's a lovely coffee spot. Ambience is cozy and filled with natural light. Drinks are consistently well made.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Good coffee nice people!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Nice cozy place to grab a coffee with friends. There is a nice butcher shop next door too that reminds me of old local meat shops! Worth the try for sure.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Great coffee, my favorite in the Bay Area so far!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Pinhole really just blesses ole Bernal with fantastic coffee, fun staff and yummy pastries when you want an extra treat. Get the mochi muffin!"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Great local neighborhood coffee shop!
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Recently moved to the neighborhood and definitely making this my go-to place! Coffee was great and the barista had a great attitude and attention to all the people coming in.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Cute coffee shop on cute street. Had a great latte as well, with plenty of snacks. Fun neighborhood spot."
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,Nice place with great lattes. The only thing I don’t like there - they don’t have an oven or microwave to warm up great tasty pastries they serve.
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Great coffee and pastries. Small coffee shop with a relaxed vibe, kid friendly and really cool decoration. Go with your kids to holly park and the have a cappuccino here ;)"
Pinhole Coffee,231 Cortland Ave,"Good coffee drinks, a smallish selection of pastry type things that are fairly decent.  Very friendly vibe, but if you aren't up for family friendly may not be your speed."
