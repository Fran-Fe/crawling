Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Their French toast was awesome! Went to Le Cafe du Soleil based on the ratings and I want not disappointed. Nice place to work with a good French toast and a coffee. Nice service too. Will go back… on a warm weekend morning.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"This cafe is such a delight! Go there when you need some serious work done! The WiFi is stable, the staff friendly, it’s bright and sunlit, and the music is on point! What a wonderful vibe! The coffee is pretty good too. I wish they had more versatile food options. They have the soup of the day everyday and so I tried the French Onion soup. Not the best part for me about this cafe!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"It's a really cute brunch place ! Really enjoyed sitting here on a nice sunny day with a hot cup of latte. The avocado toast wasn't bad , though I liked the salmon my friend ordered much better !"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Recommend: Croque Monsieur  Cafe du Soleil is more than just a brunch place. It’s where people come to have a good time, to meet new people, and to just enjoy being in the moment. And wow is the croque monsieur good!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I come to this place at least once a week, and I have to say I have never been disappointed. It is a wonderful neighborhood cafe, and every single member of the staff is so lovely. They’re all so friendly and kind, and helpful! The pastries are amazing, the tortilla espagnol is fantastic and the french toast too! My usual order is avocado toast with eggs with a latte. I love to bring my dog and sit outside on the patio with her while I enjoy my breakfast. It’s always something that brightens my day! If you’re looking to try a new place, this is the spot!!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Really wish the food choices were better here because the atmosphere and ambience was💯💯💯! Avocado toast lacked seasoning and oomph while the open faced spicy chicken sandwich lacked overall flavor and was mostly just underseasoned chicken and melted cheese.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Located in the Center of San Fran, This little Sun filled cafe is my love, fav place to go in the neighbourhood. Seating by the window is very comfortable and I love the music they play. Amazing coffee excellent services.  Did I mention their Amazing avocado toast"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Love this place! The kindest staff ever, really make you feel at home and welcome. My friends and I love to work here, great WiFi. Unfortunately not outlets, but that’s pretty typical for most local cafes in the area. Definitely recommend stopping by here, I’ve everything from their breakfast and lunch to pastries and desserts. Great selection!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I would go out of my way to visit this place again, it's a cafe in an already lovely area. The staff were good, relatively friendly. As in images, Avocado toast was ordered by one in our party - and was apparently great. Personally, I ordered the French toast. It's pretty much a thing a of beauty, and I highly recommend it. The consistency of it was essentially perfect as well. Despite that, it's not overpriced for the area. If I am around the area again I'll certainly have to hit them up again."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Came here regularly during my one month visit. Everything is delicious. Chai latte, homemade soups, quiche, French toast that was more like bread pudding but I loved it, and the people are always kind and warm! Lovely neighborhood gem, thanks for existing :)"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Cute outdoor seating with umbrellas, and an airy indoor space with big windows and lots of tables. Food was good, though on the pricy side for cafe fare.  I thought their coffee was average (I had a latte). They charge +$1 for alternative milks (like so many places, but I really appreciate the ones that don’t)."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Stopped by here to do some studying, tutoring, and a hot beverage. I ordered a tea, which was decent, but I really appreciated the vibe that the cafe set up. They had light music playing in the background, good quiches, and fast wifi: what more can you ask for from a cafe? Very chill atmosphere with plenty of people around the cafe reading and getting work done."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Gold star to the staff here! They were so nice and accommodating, really made us feel at home. Lunch options were good, but I think the pastries are where they really shine. Totally understand the draw for this neighborhood spot.  Only weird thing was when we went, EVERYONE was on their laptop. It was like we were at a school library and everyone was talking in hushed whispers. Super odd."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,I simply love this cafe ! The vegetarian sandwich with humus was incredible
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Loved the French toast. Service was great and staff were very friendly. It was a great experience to visit and eat here.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I really love this cafe. The food isn't the best - pretty overpriced and not super good ($20 for the smallest pizza), but the atmosphere makes up for it, so I keep coming back. The staff is very friendly and theres always great music playing."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,A friendly and worthy café! We found both the food and service to be excellent.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"This is my favorite café in the city. It's bright and airy with plenty of seating along the inside perimeter, with large and comfortable tables to eat and work from. A large, sturdy, beautifully aged farm table sits in the middle for communal seating. I've witnessed lots of fascinating conversations between strangers at that table. There's always pleasant and eclectic music playing at a volume where you can have a conversation. The menu is edited, which I love (quality vs quantity!), yet with plenty of savory, sweet, and healthy options (the french toast is amazing). The service is fantastic, and I've seen plenty of well-behaved dogs enjoy this café as much as their owners. My favorite thing about it? The person I assume is the owner often sits with a group of regulars by the windows, chatting lively in french. When a customer walks in, he gets up with a smile, talks to them, makes recommendations, takes their order, thanks them, and then returns to rejoin the conversation with his friends. It's just such a wholesome and nostalgic scene. This place has a great vibe."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Super friendly staff and fantastic coffee.  Has outdoor seating
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"New location after two years without my favorite cafe. It's truly a community hub for the Lower Haight. Delicious pastries and drinks, great selection of lunch options. Cafe du Soleil is a gem."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Best cafe in the city! The light and warm energy that fills this sunlight corner is next to none. I go here several times a week with friends or a computer
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Dangerously good food accompanied by a very warm atmosphere. Definitely one of the best cafes in the city
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I rarely review places, but this is the best cafe in the area. Great food, great people, and great spot. Definitely recommend it!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"This cafe has the best pastries on the west coast. Seriously, I mean it - the whole west coast possibly the world. Very time I come here they blow my mind. Service is usual and it's an elegant homey neighbourhood cafe. Good coffee. Come in and get a croissant and cappuccino."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Such a delight! Very friendly Staff, I spilled my coffee accidentally; they handled the situation very professionally and also gave me another cup of coffee. Completely made my day."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Cute cafe with light jazz playing. The staff is very friendly with a good sense of humor. There's both indoor and outdoor seating.  I've only had tea here so I'm unsure about the food but it looks delicious. They also serve beer on draft here.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"This place is filled to the brim with warmth, love, and AMAZING PASTRIES! The owner is kind and welcoming and you cannot go wrong with any type of croissant and coffee. Truly a gem in the neighborhood that makes me smile every time I walk in."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"$10 onion soup has water for broth, and is missing the chives that are seen in previous reviews."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Excellent espresso and professional baristas. I love the atmosphere. Perfect casual weekday date spot.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,I prefer it’s outdoor seating to read; Two books read by patrons here intrigued me : Cultish by Amanda Montell and The Persuaders by Anand Giridharidas; Cafe is deservedly popular because it’s a good looking cafe  in a svelte neighborhood with Waller street as its crown jewel;  but that has lent a laziness to  the decor ; it could upgrade its flimsy outdoor chairs and refurbish its rickety tables. The service  is pleasant. I need to get a sense of their signature dish- the tartine.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"It’s a wonderful cafe to relax or work in. The drinks aren’t amazing, but the ambiance and seating is outstanding."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"This is one of my favorite work spots. The staff are amazing. And the seating are pretty great too. It's a bit on the fancy side, so if that's not your vibe you might want to avoid.  It has some of the best coffee I've had in the Lower Haight. Also really wonderful are their sandwiches (all open faced with a salad), their pizza, and my favorite: French Toast.  Bear in mind it can be kind of pricey: a sandwich and a coffee would easily cost you $17 before tip. Still, I think it's worth it for an occasional treat to yourself or to your dates/friends.  As for working there, the internet is really fast. Keep in mind that there are no outlets. So bring an external battery or make sure your machine is charged.  Overall, it's a reliable place for me to go in the Lower Haight."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Friendliest team. Always great food. So happy they’re back!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"So happy they are open again! Lovely sunny spot with good salads, open faced sandwiches and little pizzas"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Took a post crib-hunting and predinner break here. Wanted something warm on this chilly day and went for their soup of the day. It was delicious and came with a few slices of toasted organic bread.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Great coffee and bakery and awesome staff. Not cheap but nothing is actually cheap in this city so 🤷
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Coffee is weak tasting. It needs more strength. Almond croissants are the type without the almond paste, so they tend to be  nothing more than a plain but very bready croissant. Cold, too. Shut the door!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Delightful food and coffee. My friend got a half chicken, which was absolutely delicious, and we sat at a table and chatted for almost two hours. Couldn't have asked for a better spot."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Bright, sunny cafe with lots of seating and good food and coffee."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Me and my friends met for breakfast, hot chocolate, and to discuss our 2023 plans.  It was the perfect place!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Lovely spot for a weekday WFH. Thoughtful menu, helpful owner / staff, solid coffee."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Café du Soleil offers great food, beverages and quality service. We had the freshest squeezed orange juice, chicken pizza and salmon salad and had an amazing time. Enjoy!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"A real hidden gem! Great service , amazing coffee. I just want to package it all up and take it back home with me."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Good service, decent coffee, very mediocre sandwiches."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Lovely little cafe with incredibly friendly service!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,The French toast was AMAZING. Delicious & well presented.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I love the mochas from here. They use Equator coffee, so yum."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Daily made baguettes and so very tasty quiches are the reasons I go there. Others go for the coffee and other french food dishes. Highly recommended!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Fantastic find!  Charming vibe.. great coffee and banana bread..
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"What a *wonderful* Cafe! Lovely music vibes, really tasty lattes, and the food & pastries are superb as well. Would highly recommend."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"True French vibes, delicious food, so fresh and yummy! Loved our visit there , and the kids loved it as well!!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Love at first sight!  I stumbled into this petite cafe. The atmosphere is warm, authentic and somehow special with nice background music. The food is really tasty and I like especially the breakfast offers. And last but not least the staff is super nice and friendly. Pity I don't live in San Francisco, I'd come often. 😉"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Nice cozy coffee shop.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Good coffee. I had a croissant, cafe de au lait and avocado toast. Delicious."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Love this neighborhood coffee shop. Perfect place for a quick bite and coffee (or beer, or wine!)"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Excellent Cafe, counter serve with french pastries. They have a small but delicious brunch menu and in the evenings they have live music. I enjoy their avacado toast with egg in the mornings and their croissants! They have outdoor seating as well, it's very casual. The barista has always been friendly and helpful. One of my favorite places near my apartment, I've been their multiple times."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Great cafe with awesome pastries, coffee, and food options. It has a really great atmosphere and location on a beautiful street in the Lower Haight."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Was staying at a friend's and needed some coffee to get me through my mountain of work. This place was one of the closest options with good reviews, so I stopped in and got a large latte and almond croissant to go. I wish I had brought my work with me! The decor is adorable (especially with the sunlight filtering in) and seems like the kind of place I would enjoy. The barista was very nice (but not overly so) and expedient, to boot. The almond croissant is absolutely perfect!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"If you are an almond croissant freak like me, you must try the ones here at Cafe du Soleil- ask them to warm it up (they don't use a microwave, they use an oven)- they are exquisite!! The coffee is pure heaven as well (Equator brand)- and the prices are very reasonable. This cafe has become my new stomping ground- the ambiance is warm and cozy, with an authentic French style. I wish I could give a 6-star rating- and I do not say that lightly."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Wonderful selection of breakfast sandwiches and pastries, as well as the tea and delicious coffee for our breakfast, just steps away from our Airbnb stay. The staff were friendly and helpful. Don't look for conversation with any of the other diners there. It may be big-city paranoia. Still a nice experience with my husband."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"casual counter-service cafe style cafe.  open,airy space, outdoor seating, french style food and baked goods.  clean food. good size portions.  coffee is good, but not the place for espresso drinks.  serves alcohol.  recommend for a quick bite or to meet and chat."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,My go-to neighborhood cafe when I want a really good quiche or a decent croque with my smooth cafe au lait.  The owner is a sweetheart and the staff is usually very nice.  Closed during covid and just re-opened across the street.  Still great. Prices went up a bit.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"A nice street-side atmosphere, tamed and strong coffee and good eats. Also very sweet baristas.  I really like that they offer the option to use a bowl for your coffee.  Give it a mark on your places to go. I reckon you'll enjoy your time here.  e: Customer service isn't really something they're used to, I guess. I'm not expecting them kiss and rub my feet. If a customer respectably asks for a refund for a charge that was paid days, don't slap cash on the counter and storm away. I was even told on the phone that I could get a refund, but oh well."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Best French toast I’ve had in my life no cap. Seriously, I thought I knew what French toast was and then I came here. Incredibly warm hospitality, good coffee, good food in a French cafe setting with outdoor seating. Get the French toast and never look back. But if eggs, pastries or avocado toast is more your thing, you won't be disappointed by those either."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Great coffee and atmosphere. Non pretentious local spot that’s the epitome of Lower Haight. It’s good for getting work done or hanging out with friends. They also serve wine and have live music in the evenings (usually on Wednesdays).
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,One of my favorite places. Has a sunny quiet terrace and also super relaxed ambient to work or just enjoy your coffee. Coffee is good and the food is excellent. They also offer a great selection of imported wines and sweet treats
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  Very briefly--I'm too busy enjoying their impeccable $5 French onion soup and particularly apt Edith Piaf remix--there's great low-key ambience, affordable and extremely delicious food, and wifi.  The place is cute enough for a tentative date and understated enough for a quick business meeting.  Wine, beer, and attentive+nice service make for a pretty much flawless experience.  A+"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Cute neighborhood hangout occasional evening performances of local musicians outdoor seating free wi fi. Standard cafe fare of pastry salads and sandwiches. I ordered the quiche and while a bit expensive it had excellent texture and flavor the crust was buttery and flakey practically melted on my tongue. Good place to enjoy morning coffee of a light lunch or brunch on weekends. Can be busy and noisy Saturday and Sunday
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"This is my favorite cafe in all of SF! Spent numerous days doing work, and enjoying their great lattes, cheese plates, pizzas and pastries. The best part: it's unpretentious and has a great warm community vibe to it."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Lightly French-inspired and usually free seating available (indoor and outdoor) but has a lackluster menu with awkwardly large portions. Recommendation: skip getting a meal here, but a lovely coffee+pastry spot to meet up with a friend."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Love this place :) I would stop in every day if I could. My favourite thing is sitting at the tables outside in the sun, with an espresso after walking the dog - just perfect! They also have a great vege open sandwich. Looking forward to my next visit :)"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"They have a big sign out front advertising their avocado toast, but I ordered it and it was two small pieces of limp dollar store wheat bread with some odd purée or avocado on it"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Cafe du Soleil is a great little company that serves up some great pastries along with good coffee and an always inviting atmosphere for the SF ""morning"" coffee goes. This Cafe in particular off of Fillmore is a quaint little setting located amongst houses and several other little eateries up the block a ways. I always grab a latte and some yogurt with granola which fixes my hunger and satiates my palette.  As long as you're in before 10am you wont have to wait too long but the line does build up fast. Make sure to check the pastries before grabbing one or two, since I have noticed a fruit fly or several floating around inside the case. One more star would've been awarded for a bit cleanlier atmosphere."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Beautiful place, open WiFi and the best... the music. All jazz standards ❤️"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"The atmosphere and the coffee are very nice! Quite cheap as well. However, french pastries way below french standards. Even though for US maybe they are very good."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"I’m two birthday candles away from 60!  I’ve been around the world. I’ve sampled European cuisine. And many flavors down the Mediterranean coast..  this café that I had lunch at Today! Rivals and exceeds the quality and quantity that I’ve had abroad! Sincerely, Frank"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,We had the Cheese and Avacado and the  Smoke Salmon open Sandwiches which were both excellent. Staff are nice. The vibe is cool and calm and the Latte is awesome.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Really nice place. Friendly staff and good food. Best one in the area!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Very nice outdoor seating, tasty pastries and good service."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Perched on a corner, there is ample outdoor street-side seating. There is beautiful large wooden table inside, welcoming people to share the space. There are also many single tables for 2 people. Free wi-fi, great selection of food and drinks. This place is a winner of a cafe!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"An amazing little French café. Appropriately named “Café of the Sun,” they get quite a bit of sunlight on their outdoor patio and indoors. It’s a great place to get a nice coffee drink and a small bite. It’s popular to sit outside with your dog here and enjoy life—Parisian style. But there are no outlets for those that need longer battery life. Nice location just off Haight St. It can get a bit crowded on the weekend for brunch, but it’s worth a visit anytime."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Food and drink wise they are a five beautiful setting in a nice neighborhood.  The problem is that they are really not good about caring for mother earth. When you bring your cup to do your thing about waste reduction they use a paper cup to measure that you don't get too much coffee that then gets thrown away.  Sad but true - this exists in SF.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Kinda expensive, french bakery type food/cafe. Good for brunch, or small plates between meals. Large tables inside for big groups if you can snag one. Also good for single folks, drinking/reading."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Nice pastries and coffee, but come early before they sell out! We had the last almond croissant of the day @ 11am (!) But it was really, really buttery and flaky, and all around delicious."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Love this place. Great French food, quiet, sunny mid day, friendly service, clean... Lines are always manageable. Makes you feel like you're in Paris. Coffee drinks, beer and wine."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"My absolute favorite coffee shop in all of San Francisco. You won't find any outlets, but you will get loads of work done as the atmosphere is warm, comfortable and inviting, and you'll enjoy the music, coffee, and wine selection."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Neighborhood favorite. We bring all visitors to SF here. We're so happy they're back in the hood!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"A French coffee shop imitation. It might be more impressive if they took the French theme further, currently it feels a bit half-hearted. The place also seemed somewhat in disarray: one server mistook my order, the other server acted rather surly, and butter packets were half-melted. When I arrived at noon,  I ordered soup and cafe-au-lait, both of which were OK but unremarkable. Around noon, there were also almost no pastries or small plates left, the five that were left did not look particularly appealing. Finally, be aware that there are NO power outlets."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Located a block off of busy Haight Street is this quintessential homey, neighborhood corner cafe with a warm staff and wide-selection of baked goods. There's ample outdoor and indoor seatings as well, and doggos appears welcomed."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Great hot foods. Their mochas are just ok. Nothing to write home to Mom about.  Their pastries look tasty, and the flies landing in them in the case I'm sure think so too, but I'm not interested in trying them."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Another grand Lower Haight café.  Inviting staff, delightful atmosphere, good French-inspired food and wine, and the usual espresso and tea choices.  Fresh and savory Wi-Fi.  And sun. Did I forget to riff on the café's name? It's on the northern side of the street, getting lots of sun. So when"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Smoked Trout Salad and a glass of Pinot Noir were delicious. The ambiance is very low key. Folks on their laptops and coffee. It's a nice place for a Sunday afternoon treat.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Great open-faced sandwiches, and coffee. Outside tables are nice place to chill out for an hour or two. No outlets, but they have free Wi-Fi."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,One of the best cafes in the city. Delicious and the salads are huge!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Very nice but low key cafe with good coffee, wine, food, pastries. They have a fair amount of outdoor seating. One of my favorite cafes"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Good Coffee. Non Euphoric service and great paticcerie. Breakfast menu is limited without huge flexibility.  Good for adults but not massive choice for kids.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,The Lower Haight is where its at! Cafe du Soleil has a wonderful ambiance and its really a good place to chat when you actually want to hear what your friends are saying. Sometimes its a little dark so be sure to ask them to brighten it up. Not just good for coffee but also for light food.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,The coffee could be better but love the pastries
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Delicious pastry and good coffee, very friendly service. It's very cozy and cute and has outdoor seating which works great on warm days"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Great place. We had lattes, almond croissant and apricot danish, everything was just awesome. Super friendly staff. Market this place as Favorite:)"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Great spot to meet for a conversation or get some work done.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,This place is great for a lazy breakfast or lunch. A very nice french cafe with good coffee and fantastic french eats. A good place to go and spoil yourself with an authentic french pastry.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Great place to sip a coffee and do some work. Great ambient. Lover the hummus open face sandwich. Super friendly staff. Good place to come by yourself.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Love this cute little patisserie right in the heart of Lower Haight. Baskets filled with freshly-baked baguettes call to passers by; the pastry counter is lined beautifully with pastries. I easily settled on a chocolate hazelnut croissant which called my name, plus a open face ham and gruyere sandwich. Delicious ham, gooey gruyere and crisp mini pickles made it a great afternoon stop, but the pastry stole the show — bittersweet chocolate enrobed in fluffy brioche and dusted with hazelnuts. Their friendly staff and free wifi was the cherry on top."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Croissants are the best, although I wouldn't recommend French toasts there. Mornings there have certain French atmosphere, although they are almost always full of people."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"A real boulangerie with full selection of pastries, and great weekend brunches, super friendly and popular with locals. Sidewalk seating, live music on the weeknights."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Lovely spot with great sweets and eat. Staff has always been friendly and helpful. Can get busy and quite full. Wifi but no plugs. Sit outside on a sunny day.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Cozy café delicious salads open face sandwiches sweets live music sit indoors or outside. Speedy service. Nice prices.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Nothing revolutionary about this place - a La Boulange by another name (food wise). It's usually too warm inside to study or socialize and the balding man who normally works there is rude and, quite possibly, incapable of smiling. I come here out of convenience mostly."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Amazing pastries and coffee for a quick fix.  If you have time to stay, sit down for the “bread-pudding-esque” french toast or the Spanish tortilla with salmon."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"My Take: french bistro that stays true to its root | Went For: Saturday brunch | The Vibe: neighborhood ambiance | Special Dish: Open Face Sandwiches, Smoked Salmon | Avoid Their: n/a | Price Point: $10.00 - $12.00 per entrees | The Service: order at counter | Reservations: n/a | FYI, FRIENDS: their coffee is on point, too -- Eat up, Kimmie"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Work on your tan, and your next big article. In your favorite order. Free wifi. Calm and inspiring atmosphere. Good food, organic coffee. Try Hummus sandwich."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Great French spot with friendly staff, good food / coffee, lots of seating and good wifi. No plugs though.  Try the open face sandwiches or the granola and yogurt for breakfast."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"A solid local cafe. Their food here is also quite good, with large portions (by cafe standards). And yes, they serve beer and wine."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Great atmosphere and worth a trip every time I'm in San Francisco. The food is worth the treat, though if you have an appetite, it may be a bit small."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,A wonderful coffee shop early in the morning two blocks away from my house on Waller Street it's just great the food the breakfast is outstanding they make their own granola cereal thank you very much
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"fantastic cafe. coffee, pastries, beer+wine, great sandwiches. sidewalk seating (sadly lacking in most of San Francisco) on the south side of the street. beautiful."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Great place but service is not very good.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Friendly, local, cafe for a glass of wine or a cup of coffee. Would be nice if they offered a few vegan pastries though."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"It is a really nice cafe in a really nice area of the city. A great place to work, except they don't have plugs to connect the computer."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Wonderful food and very friendly staff. Street parking might be hard to find, but a great Cafe in a nice relaxing spot."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Decent little bakery and coffee house with some nice outdoor seating. Atmosphere is great and staff was super friendly.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"this is my GO to cafe for this Particular Hood.  Great Staff. "" they look like they Like each other and are close' always helpful and Are extra friendly to their regulars.. Im always Happy with the SOUP of the day!!"
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Something seems to always go wrong with my hot drink order but I love this place. Get there early to try the baked goods, they sell out fast."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Good French cafe. Nice place to hang out and work on a laptop with free wifi. Even better if you can grab the limited seating outside.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,One of my favorite cafes in all of San Francisco. Fantastic coffee with a wonderful ambiance both inside and out.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,The French toast is unique and delicious. It's more like cake than toast!
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Have been staying nearby for a few nights while visiting San Francisco. Have been here every morning. Great coffee great food not overpriced
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Delicious food and drinks served in a real atmosphere.  I’ve been to places in Paris that are less Parisian than this perfect spot.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Waited forever ( more than 20 minutes) for a simple salad, finally went inside to ask where my food was and was told they haven't even started yet. I told them to shove it and left, it wasn't even busy..."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"We enjoyed a tasty lunch here, it was a nice day and the tables outside are wonderful. Food was good though a little on the high side."
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,Can't fault this place. Was my local for a few days. Great working cafe. Good coffee and food. Fabulous location.
Le Cafe du Soleil,400 Waller St,"Very cozy all-day cafe, light sandwiches and salads are excellent, good wine options for a cafe. A neighborhood favorite."
