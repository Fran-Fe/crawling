Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Really great service! We thought they had outdoor seating and brought our dog. Turns out they don’t, but they offered to move a table outside without us even asking. Really nice. The food was great too. I think the breakfast wrap and the fruit platter were the most notable things we ordered. The open faced breakfast sandwiches come with cream cheese which is not mentioned on the menu, now you know! We are looking forward to going back."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I said I had a gluten and dairy allergy and the server was so kind, he made this new entree for me! The plating is beautiful and delicious. The plants outside are gorgeous. I had the whole cafe to myself on a Tuesday evening. WiFi is fast"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Sandwiches were nicely presented and tasted DELICIOUS 😋. Will come back for their breakfast offerings. Pepe and Ulysses were very friendly. Wonderful customer service!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Best cafe spot in the city; come here for cheap  coffee, gourmet plated cafe sandwiches, and other snacks. Has Wi-Fi and outlets as well which makes it even more unique since most cafe have no outlets anymore. Recommend getting a meal, comes with really good soup."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Wonderful neighborhood spot with made to order, healthy, and interestingly created breakfast/brunch options. The smoked salmon on the open faced sandwich was fresh and high grade; ripe avocado. Yum!!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I just know I'll be thinking fondly of this meal every single day until I'm old. Every detail was so beautiful, and the service was incredibly kind. If I'm back in SF I will be sure to stop by again!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Great service and this place really knows how to make some good breakfast. Cafe La Flore goes above and beyond with its drink selection, as well as the presentation for each dish. While some food items can be pushing the pricey side a bit, the amount of care and precision that is put into each dish will make up for that tenfold. It's a perfect place to study, enjoy a morning before work, or even impress a date."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Of the highly rated places in the neighborhood that I've tried recently, Cafe La Flore has the best coffee so far.  Great flavor, no bitterness.  I'm guessing they don't use water that's too hot.  I had mine with cinnamon only, and it was perfect for my ride home to the East Bay.   But I only had the coffee to go, so please bear that in mind with regard to the 5 star rating.  Service was excellent; sorry I did not get her name for appropriate kudos here.  By the way, the menu looked good.  Enjoy!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Really cheap sandwich + soup combo Super tasty, presentation is so pretty. Special thank you to the nicest staff 💕"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"The food here is truly amazing! Each dish is so well-crafted and individually made with love & attention to detail. The beverages are also fantastic - especially the lattes. I'm so happy I found this cafe, I will be coming back many more times!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Great food with artistic plating. This restaurant has been a favorite for me and my family for almost a decade. I've also come here to study with my friends as there's free WiFi and upbeat music.  When ordering a sandwich, the soup or salad ordered with it comes first as an appetizer with the sandwich being served soon after.  Pictured: Santa Fe wrap with ceasar salad and chicken escoffier with cream of mushroom soup."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Cafe la Flore is a Sunset Gem! Pepe, previously a gourmet chef in another San Francisco establishment, will make sure you're in good hands. The presentation of the food is fantastic and the daily special is great value. Salad and a main course that's healthy and delicious all for just under 11$ What a steal! I'd encourage anyone to give this restaurant and the owner a shot!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Awesome place with super friendly staff and delicious food. Really shows how much thought and care they put into traditionally simple menu items that other places put little to no thought into. Everything, from a cappuccino to a relatively simple sandwich shows the utmost thought and attention.  Highly recommend for a sit-down lunch or just working away on your laptop!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I didn't look at any reviews or pictures before coming here, so I was pretty surprised at how beautiful the plating was! An overall tasty experience."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,delicious food and coffee. very friendly service.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Very chill and friendly spot to stop for a refreshing and satisfying meal.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,The food was wonderful. Good portion sizes. The server was very nice. I got the mushroom omelette sandwich and the green tea frappe. Both were great. Would definitely come again.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"This is one of the best breakfast places in San Francisco. The food is very tasty, and it has a very good presentation. The service was great as well, the staff kind and very friendly. The place is very cozy and has a nice vibe. The price is fair because the food is delicious. I highly recommend this place, definitely we are coming back."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Amazing food that was super fresh. Impeccable presentation and super helpful staff. Will definitely visit again. A lot of vegetarian options.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I do enjoy going here a lot! The cafe owner is really nice and friendly, and it's a great place to work if you're looking for a quiet spot. The drinks are relatively good and the crowd is mostly working professionals or people coming to grab a bite to eat.  Other pros: -They have Wifi and outlets -The space is relatively clean  Information to know: -$8 minimum for card payments -No vegan options for food (unless you ask for modifications)"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"FIVE STAR. Let's start with the moneymaker... The food. Some of the best presentation you'll ever see, especially considering the price. The food is delicious with great combinations of texture, taste, and temperature. My open faced smoked salmon on an English muffin looks and tastes as though it's made by a Michelin chef. Can't get enough of this place. The coffee is great. I prefer just a plain black coffee and it was exactly how I want a coffee to taste. I've had other coffee drinks and they may or may not blow you away but it's what you'd expect. They don't cut corners. The service could use some work, HOWEVER take the time to talk to the owner/chef. He is so welcoming and so nice. He's one of the friendliest people and it makes you want to come back. That and he's amazing at what he does."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I like the paintings all around and the fact that they have a second floor balcony. Staff was very nice and professional, I really liked the customer service they gave me and food was goooooodd!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"A small cafe/restaurant located just a bit west of the main inner sunset area. From the outside, it looks like a simple cafe but the food here is really good. You can tell that the chef takes a lot of pride in the food. The flavor and plate presentation is up there with higher end restaurants. Just look at some other customer reviews.  One downside to this attention to detail, was that the service was slow. They seemed to be understaffed for what they were doing. It's one waiter and one chef for the whole place and since every meal is a masterpiece, it takes a while. Only 5 tables were occupied and it took about 15-20 minutes just to order. I saw one couple leave because it took too long to order.  I also think the quality of the food is lost with some customers who just come in expecting a quick bite with coffee. The BLT or Tuna Melt you order will not look like in other coffee shops, which makes it special but may not be what some are looking for.  Either way really exquisite, tasty food, but it took a long time."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Pepe makes really tasty and beautiful sandwiches and wraps! The cafe is also a really great place to work. This is one of the reasons I miss living in the neighborhood!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I recently dined at Cafe La Flore Irving and was thoroughly impressed with my experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly host who made me feel welcome and showed me to my table. The decor was stylish and modern, creating a cozy atmosphere for dining. The food was delicious , the service was exceptional."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Was wandering around the neighborhood when I came across this little cafe. Relaxing, adorable, and some really cool lunch options. I got an open-faced sandwich (wasn't entirely sure how to eat it but it was really good!). Good coffee, service was great. Free wi-fi here. I told my friend about it and she brought her grandparents here when they visited SF"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,The taste of the food and presentation were both amazing!! And so affordable!! This place is truly a hidden gem and I would recommend it to everyone to give it a try if they are in the area!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Loved the wraps, reminds me of a more healthier burrito 😊. Very great taste and plenty of food in the wrap( looks can be deceiving) . Soup and salad good and crispy."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Incredible wood with incredible service. Don’t be fooled by the simple interior or location. The food is incredible. Feels like a high class restaurant with reasonable prices for the area.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"BEST Internet cafe in the hood! So grateful I found this place. Not only do they have wonderful high speed internet, the food and drinks are AMAZING (seriously not a bad item on the menu) and the music is always rockin and keeping me motivated to work. The owner is the sweetest man who will try to honor any special requests and maintains a quality establishment. Stoked I live so close to this place and would eat there daily if I could!!! Amazing food presentation and quality."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The service sucked the staff were rude. The bathroom is a closet and not sanitary. Cannot follow food orders when it comes to allergies. Would never waste my money or time again here. Save your time
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I really enjoyed this restaurant! great food, one of the best dishes in San Francisco if you ask me, hospitable, clean and good Wi-Fi if you happen to need it"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"This is one of the most awful places I have been to in San Francisco. I came to work on a project and enjoy some of their food from their many selections. But when I prided a my food and explicitly said I do not want pork there was pork in my dish. Which led me to also realize they do not sanatize their utensil so if you order vegitarian food they use utensils that have been used for all of their meats. Once I pointed it out the ""chef"" began to clean the utensils. I did not make it a big deal, but right after they told me I had to leave which I didn't mind because I could not stand the smell of the food they just served me and litterally wanted to puke."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"The food was delicious and very tasty! I loved the good environment, very clean and organized restaurant and the staff was very nice."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Beautiful plating good taste friendly service Definitely recommend it.

Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I went here with my 93 yr old Mom for lunch, I had the roast beef sandwich and Mom had the chicken brie sandwich it was presented beautifully  and the taste was wonderful.

Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,This is the best cafe I've ever been to. Portions are small but the prices are great and the food is phenomenal. Breakfast and lunch are absolutely fantastic and their presentation is top notch.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"In the city for a vacation over labor day weekend, and the location was surprisingly quiet at 9:30 on a Saturday. Friendly staff and a nice open space. Coffee is very good and the ""healthy eater"" breakfast sandwich is delicious. My girlfriend got the best tasting matcha latte I've ever stolen a sip from. Even more confused how this place is so quiet..."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Had smoothies, coffees, smoked salmon with scrambled egg and avocado on an English muffin with fruit and a scrambled egg wrap with bacon. Feasts for the eyes as well as very tasty!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Great coffee and food but the real pleasure I have here is the PLATING. I'll need to remember to take some more pics the next time I go because all the dishes are uniquely done but so much is added with a simple bit of yogurt, hot sauce, and fruit."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,We arrived by chance in this cafe and were surprised by the freshness of the products used in the kitchen. We will definitely return!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Awesome neighborhood cafe! We live around the corner and come here often. The coffee is great! The owner is from Peru and makes awesome breakfast wraps we often take on the road with us. I come here during the workday sometimes and also the weekend for a cozy place away from home to read. Highly recommend!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,How can breakfast taste this good it's insane. My sandwich was so good my eye was twitching.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"3.5 stars and increasing! Cute neighborhood cafe with decent coffee and breakfast. I appreciate the ambiance in that shop, it reminds me of the coffee shops before the whole industrial vibe took over. The barista is perfecting his craft over time and the coffee is getting better each time. Great place to meet up with friends, do a little work, or just hang out."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"When I got a sandwich at a coffee shop, I didn't expect one of the best meals I've had in months."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"If you want a sandwich like any other, go anywhere, but if you want a sandwich or a salad from a real chef, I 100% recommend this cafe, which also has super good prices for the quality of food and service every time I go. to San Francisco I do not hesitate to go through this wonderful place attended by its owner!!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Mediterranean Tuna & Chicken Pesto Napoleon delish... The cafe is clean and has 5G internet. The food is amazing!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Cafe la Flore is truly a gem. The food is incredible, likely one of the best sandwiches I’ve had in the city. I can’t stop thinking about the roast beef sandwich.  Can’t go wrong with the smoothies and breakfast options. Bonus Pepe the owner is one of the nicest people I’ve ever met and he’s worked on accommodating my girlfriend dietary needs. Make sure to check out this hidden gem in the sunset or when you are strolling around golden gate park!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"This place is somewhat unassuming on the inside & outside, but wow the food is incredible. I stopped in for lunch and got the open-faced chicken brie sandwich with a side salad and an iced latte, all for about $20. It was a ton of food, and everything tasted super fresh. Will definitely be back."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Great experience. Quaint little cafe with great options and great coffee. Would recommend to anyone looking to eat somew around golden gate park.

Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Fantastic place for eat something fast. The sandwich was very good, and the owner did a great job with the service"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I used to live in inner Richmond and would go to the Cafe Flore there all the time. I popped into the Irving one a few days ago. Staff (as always) is super friendly, food is plated like a 3 star michelin restaurant which i always forget that they do that but it’s 😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 when they bring it out - like the $9 BLT should be featured on a magazine cover. Food quality is always superb, and they had an outlet for me to work on my laptop for a bit. Love this place"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"This is a gem. The food is really fresh, and the chef pays amazing details to little things, like grilling the wrap and slicing the bacon really thin, almost like a chip. The plating is beautiful too. For the price of food, this place highly exceeded our expectations!!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Great food, service and prices. I preferred the beef over the turkey. Both were excellent."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"An assuming, relaxed experience with amazing quality and presentation. They know how to make a straightforward dish (e.g. a BLT) a tasty, beautiful experience. One of my favorite spots in SF for a solid sandwich."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,The owner is super kind :) iced coffee was good too!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,I always feel like a VIP when I come to La Flore. The owner is very friendly and kind and the food is good.

Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Amazing cafe. Good food. Fresh veggies. Latte is really good too. And is never too crowded. Staff is really courteous and service is great.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"The review is about the service. My child really wanted to have a piece of bread, which i understand they dnt sell. I suggested to pay for a sandwich and if they could just give me a piece of bread. Both the person at the counter and the supervisor declined. How difficult is this to do...."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Cafe La Flore which we call Pepe's - after its owner and chef - is my family's favorite cafe in San Francisco. The food is outstanding, the presentation is off the hook, and the service is warm and authentic. If you have not been here before, you owe yourself a visit!!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Amazing small cafe near Botanical gardens. Sandwiches tasted as good as they looked at great prices.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I stopped by the Cafe de Flore after a walk in Golden Gate Park. The chicken wrap was excellent! It was packed with large chunks of freshly made chicken, avacado and pico de gaio inside a toasted flour tortilla. It was accompanied by a flavorful salad of mixed greens, toasted walnuts, blue cheese and a hearty vinaigrette. There was such care and pride in this dish! After half of the wrap, I couldn't eat another bite. I happily took the remaining half home for a mid-week dinner. I half complete confidence that the rest of the menu is just as good."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,The open-faced egg and salmon sandwich was good. The service was quick and there was no wait to order.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Great coffee, great breakfast and pleasant staff. Food was fresh and perfectly cooked and the presentation was a nice touch."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Cafe La Flore serves the best brunch food I have ever eaten. Their wraps are stellar, their smoothies are delicious, but above all is how much care the owner puts into his food. He is unbelievably kind and makes an effort to make every dish he serves look and taste like it came out of a 5 star restaurant. I cannot recommend this place enough, and he gets no where near the business he deserves."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Just amazing! Generous, beautiful tasty servings of creative sandwiches, wraps and salads!  Good cafe drinks and smoothies too. This is clearly a labor of love for the cook. When we were there, he apologized for wait because he was single-handedly doing everything that day.  Yet he did not skimp an iota of care in the preparation.  Truly worth the weight!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Sweet place. Excellent presentation, great portions, wholesome ingredients. I came here 1-2 times a week to get the lunch veggie wrap for about 6 months. Owner is super nice!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Amazing service, delicious sandwiches and great prices. Highly recommend and every single time I go there it is a pure enjoyment! Great job 💛"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Wifi sucks ,  the bread of the smoked jack was too dry but overall a delicious experience! (But my lips hurt)"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Cafe La Flora is a great neighborhood cafe.  The food and presentation would make you think you are at a cafe in Paris. Just a lovely atmosphere, and an owner that makes you feel welcome. By far my favorite cafe in San Francisco. The drinks are awesome, the regulars are friendly, stop in!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,This has got to be one of the best cafes I’ve ever been to the food is amazing and they really take care of you. The owner treats you like if you were a friend and the prices are very good. if there’s a sandwich that I could really recommend it has got to be the turkey sandwich without a doubt. During this COVID 19 time I have got to say that this cafe makes you feel safe but at the same time make you feel the resembling Normality with going to a local coffee shop also they have variety when it comes to food there’s a lot to choose from here there coffee has got to be one of the best coffee s I’ve ever had I will definitely comeback to cafe la flore for this great experience that they offer the food presentation is great it really shows that they care about how and what the quality of the food is when the customer gets it
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Really delicious food beautifully plated. One of the best mochas around.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"This place is a gem. The owner and chef is just the most amazingly friendly person. The food is delicious and the presentation is beautiful. This is one of our favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often. Oh, and the vanilla iced late's are sooo good as a bonus. 😋 …"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Very good food, great service, amazing presentation. Also well proportioned, I don’t feel stuffed nor hungry at the end of the meal. It’s not super greasy either."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"This is an unpretentious but hugely satisfying place to grab a quick bite or hang out with friends or solo. It's half way between 9th Ave and 19th Ave, so it has less crowds and a more neighborhood feel. You get an espresso cafe with internet plus a surprisingly robust menu. I live around the corner, so it's perfect to get out for a cafe mocha or grab a sandwich to picnic in Golden Gate Park. There's indoor and sidewalk seating. I recently saw a family of three happily having a sumptuous breakfast at a table outside. The staff is very attentive. Ambience includes wall art ranging from Parisian to Rock and Roll, along with a backdrop of Ibiza-inspired chill music."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,My party of 4 attempted to go here for Saturday brunch just before noon. We were refused service because they had a policy to not serve parties of more than three without a reservation. Restaurant was less than half full at the time. Flagging for those looking to get brunch with more than two friends.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Comfy, clean cafe in the Inner Sunset. Peppe’ is a great owner, friendly and local."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Wow, Pepe is amazing but this cafe is a great space to enjoy great food, wraps, sandwiches, smoothies and more.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and freshness, and this is my go to local spot for quick eats or hanging out and reading a book with some coffee.  Really enjoy visiting this space."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Food is absolutely unbelievable. I can't believe I spent less than $7 on the most amazing breakfast I have ever had. This is no exaggeration. The freshness of the food was perfect. The preparation was 5-star, and the price was half of what they could get away with considering the level of quality and presentation. You have to try this place. Best value in San Francisco."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"The food is amazing. Pepe is a great cooker and he make everything with dedication and love. It isn't expensive and you eat like a king/queen. It's near the Golden Gate Park, so if you want to eat in the park you can also ask for taking the food away. Coffees and smoothies also great!  People love as well the music of the Café and the ambience."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Food was very well prepared and tasted delicious! Very nice breakfast cafe!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,DoorDash screwed up the order. It told us that the order was ready for pickup. When we arrived the owner was surprised and said that he had no such order. However he  set to it and immediately made us the 2 dishes. Cajun Chicken salad and Chicken Brie Sandwich. They were excellent with just the right amount of cheese. The chicken was cooked well and tasty. We also had a Aloha smoothie made fresh and tasty. Would go back and order personally instead is through DoorDash next time.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,I never write a review but I also have never been treated this way from a restaurant… we tried to call to make an order to go and they never responded. We drove there because they said they take orders to go… when I arrived I ordered the food for three people people and after I ordered they looked around in the store and said: sorry there are two people seated (literally the only two people in the restaurant) and they made a reservation so we can’t take your order because we need to wait until they are ready to order and focus on them!!! I was shocked and asked: seriously?? And they said yes sorry we need to concentrate on them.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Very Friendly & Cozy. Food and latte were satisfying. Definitely recommend.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"What a perfect neighborhood spot. Some of the friendliest people I’ve met since moving here. Sandwiches are top notch. Plating is excellent too, which is a welcome change of pace from most breakfast/lunch shops. Looking forward to coming through again and again."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"The cook is a 5 star chef. It's not only delicious but he always makes a beautiful looking plate, like if you are eating at a fancy restaurant. I go there at least once a week, and I am always impressed by his skills. Very lucky to have them close by."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Nice place to have good coffee and tasty food !!!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,I've been coming here since 2016. The service is amazing theres a nice peruvian man behind the counter. The food bomb and the coffee to due for highly recommended!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Honestly, this is hands-down my FAVORITE cafe in all of SF. It’s got loads of room, power outlets, delicious and well-portioned foods, as well as awesome coffee + other drinks. My girlfriend and I love coming here to get work done. Moreover, the guy behind the counter is the sweetest most hospitable guy you’ll come across. Please go and give this cafe a try - you won’t regret it."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"La Flore has the best staff of any coffee shop in the Inner Sunset, in terms of friendliness and helpfulness. The coffee isn't WOW, but the food is reasonable and fresh, and there's usually seating available. And like I said, staff not being the usual surly types goes a long way."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Great place for breakfast! Their food is very delicious and I love the presentation with all of their dishes.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Great food. Truly exceptional for a café. The chef there really takes pride in his work whether it be a simple sandwich or extravagant salad. The coffees good too! Free WiFi and outlets available for your laptop. A hidden gem in the sunset.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Probably the best sandwiches you can buy around this area. Pepe has some mad skills in making a good sandwich. I am always pleasantly surprised how he manages to put different ingredients in a sandwich and make them delicious. Go grab one and see for yourself. As you are grabbing one, may be get a smoothie to go :) It will help the our favorite local businesses to survive through this COVID times. I hope the restaurant opens for sitting soon, so that I can grab my coffee and read a book like the good ol' days."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Good coffee and absolutely friendly.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Favorite cafe in SF--great food, drinks, and very friendly staff! Great place to get work done as well!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,The chef is very artistic and creative.  Love the food there. Absolutely a good start of the day.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Cafe La Flore Irving is an old cafe with a very friendly owner. It definitely feels old inside, but my iced latte was good. There are outlets throughout the space and free, strong wifi. It's a local spot where you don't feel guilty staying awhile."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Nice selection of breakfast sandwiches and bagels in the 4-6 price range. Has a small mezzanine with seating, and the high ceiling gives it a very open, airy atmosphere. There's wifi, and lots of people on laptops on a mid-Sunday morning. The French press was darkly roasted with a heavy, oily scent but a lot lighter, smoother taste that's surprisingly drinkable for a dark roast in the morning."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Very delicious breakfast. A feast for my taste buds. And coffee is goooood!
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,To much cheese and no flavor. And this is for 9.00$ and it is also too overpriced. As well as I can make this at home but better.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Wrap was very good
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Best Chai Latte, super nice staff!"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Great wraps, sandwiches, coffee, smoothies; excellent service from an extremely nice gentleman who runs the place & basically does it all by himself. One of the few places on Irving that has wifi & outlets with ample seating so you can have a light lunch & work on your laptop. A little out of the way (a block west past Andronico’s), so not usually too crowded, never too noisy, but always at least a few people there chatting over coffee or working on laptops."
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,Coffee is delicious in the staff is so friendly.
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"I met here with a friend just to have a small chat. The place is very small but quiet; the staff is attentive and the lattes are very good. I had a delicious giant cookie with sprinkes on the top that reminds me of a similar mexican cookie from my childhood.  In general, is a good place to have some work done"
Cafe La Flore Irving,1340 Irving St,"Excellent small, independent cafe on a quiet stretch of road. Free wifi, sit down or to go. Really nice people work there, excellent at-home feel. I had the morning burrito and it's one of the best I've ever had."
