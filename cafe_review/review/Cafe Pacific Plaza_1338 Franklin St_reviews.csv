Cafe Pacific Plaza,1338 Franklin St,"This place has the best turkey club. I used to get it about once a week when I worked near there. I left that job in 2017, and live an hour from the city. I still consider making a special trip into the city to get that turkey club. Maybe it's changed but probably not. And the people that work there are really nice."

Cafe Pacific Plaza,1338 Franklin St,"This is the best spot for breakfast that have found so far in the city. I will say that the quests are mostly local construction workers and this that live close but don't let that distract you. They gave an amazing set of dishes like their Hawaiian breakfast and house omelet, both are amazing. What they don't have is a lot of flair but the flavor makes up for it."

Cafe Pacific Plaza,1338 Franklin St,"Before going in, I thought it was a small place. Really didn’t expect it to have so many seatings (probably 20+), and 6 people working behind the  small counter. The operation was really efficient; I got my BLT sandwich in a few minutes when it’s busy at lunch time. The sandwich was perfect, the bacon crispy but not too burnt or dried. I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo before eating it. Lol. Price was really resealable. Will check out their Korean food next time."
