BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,A very cute cafe with an exquisite breakfast menu. The Bush Street Morning Sandwich was perfect: warm and toasty. Their Matcha Latte will also warm your heart.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great place for breakfast. We got two items from their specials, funky town and veggie bagel. Both really tasty and big, consider sharing. My daughter got the cragel sando and loved it. Cappucino, hot chocolate and pour coffee were excellent. Stop by if you are hungry!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"We really liked the Cranberry Turkey and Egg Salad sandwiches- good crust on the bread, the right ratio between ingredients and decent sized portions.  The banana bread was also really good, moist and not too sweet.  The coffee was decent (we got espresso and capuccino), but needs a little bit of extra work to be called a specialty coffee (temperature was too high and and flavour not as strong).  Service was nice and fast, would definitely come back for the food!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great coffee taste that competes with any coffee specialist in town. The dishes are very fresh and delicious. Great vibes! Highly recommended
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"A more intimate cafe with enough seating for you to enjoy a light breakfast and a couple laughs over coffee. I found the crogel and lux (croissant/bagel with smoked salmon) to over perform expectations, there was something about the mixed greens in there that just balanced everything and was refreshing!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I was very lucky that I could find this near the hotel where I stayed. The ingredients were very fresh and so tasty. The late was also great and two guys were very kind! I paid 36 USD for the food in the pictures, I guess this cafe is reasonable with such a freshness in this area."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Very delicious sandwiches. The coffee was great too!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The Cragel croissant/bagel is solid! This is one of the few breakfast sandwich spots that actually cooks, and crisps their bacon! Will be back, $11.68 for a Breakfast Sando so standard for SF"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,I really like the interior and the the style of everything  here. My favorite thing is the mojito coffee here which is spectacular and always has me coming back. It’s a cold brew with mint and getting it half sweet is perfect! The food was decent from what I’ve tried.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I have lived in the neighborhood for almost 10 years. It is always my goal to support local. But with so many good cafes in the neighborhood no need to waste my time at this one any longer. The service is SO SLOW and the person taking orders is borderline incompetent. The owner does not know how to run an efficient operation. Not to mention the price gouging. $40 for two breakfast sandwiches?! I get hung up on all the time, the order is wrong all the time and the gag is I order the same two breakfast sandwiches every time. As a local who knows what I’m talking about, go to Posh bagel or fresh brew coffee up the street."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Lovely breakfast cafe in a nice part of San francisco. Delicious ""Lox Bagel"" which they can substitute a croissant for. Croissants the best tasting one I've had in San Francisco so far . Exquisite smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber, etc., all very very well done. Delightful to sit outside at cafe table and watch the world go by."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Bagel and cragel were very good, so we came again for breakfast. The cafe was very clean, the atmosphere was nice."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Cozy little cafe with a variety of sandwiches and drinks. It’s a perfect place for catching up with a friend or two! I had the bulgogi sandwich which was delightful!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"very cute little cafe in the area of Nob Hill. might not be suited for large groups, tables are rather small. highly recommend the cragel sando, best breakfast sandwich i ever had. came out piping hot and delicious. very good drip coffee. also the pastries were really good, had a carrot/nut cake that was just fantastic. staff is very friendly."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Cute cafe with a unique menu. The bulgogi beef sandwich was great!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Visited twice while in SF.  Great bagels and coffee!  Definitely recommended.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I hate these coffee shops that put at least 15% of tips for selection, and easily trick you into paying too much tip, while you need to get inline and later get everything by yourselves. I can't go get my money back, hence the bad review  sandwiches are pretty special here"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This place looks really cool and the atmosphere is nice. Good vives and lady there who took our order was awesome 👌 They didn't mark our drinks, and we had 4 of them. It was not a terrible thing, but we had to taste to see which was which. We had iced  lattes with almond milk and another with oatmilk. 2 Italian sodas. The kids loved their drinks. The coffee was okay, I had higher hopes for the coffee because the place was pretty cool. Not a lot of seating, but that's expected  in the city."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Excellent breakfast spot, be sure to arrive early as this place gets quite busy. The cragel is definitely worth trying and the coffee is amazing. So good that we visited three days in a row during our stay in San Fran!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Super cute and quaint cafe with semi sweet French vibes. Good for sun gazing and writing your next novel while watching the world pass by their oversized windows. I had a classic bagel with cream cheese and an iced chai that transported me back to Brooklyn on a Saturday afternoon.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Nice, bright, but small shop.  Great quick stop for some coffee and brunch.  Both cold brew and latte were pretty good.  The cragel with egg and sausage was okay.  Friendly service!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"My wife and I were visiting from Denver and wanted coffee within walking distance from Union Square. This coffee shop had a great atmosphere and friendly service. Most of all, the coffee is delicious! The cuban latte is to die for."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Cute little coffee shop with some good food and drink options. A reasonable amount of seating packed into a narrow space. Nice exposed brick walls and fun multi-color seating. Fast service.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Your average dirty, crowded SF coffee bar with good breads and sandwiches. No vegan options really. Just pretty guys to look at."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Quiet place with great coffee and breakfast. Staff are quiet but pleasant. Great ambience to chill out and enjoy your cup of coffee - I had a mocha that was not too sweet and had a really nice balance of coffee and chocolate - most places make it such that you can barely taste the coffee. I also really enjoyed the egg salad on onion bagel. Definitely worth a visit.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,We ate breakfast on Sunday early morning. There were few people. Coffee and toastcup were served quickly compared with everything bagel. We got a light meal here. It’s okay quality nothing surprising.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The most amazing coffee shop in San Francisco! I lived in the neighborhood and was here almost everyday. Whether it was to study, to work, or just to relax. This lil coffee shop never let me down. In Nob Hill, It’s a short uphill walk from Union Square, off of the Powell cable car line. It’s fun if you enjoy people watching, a nice cup of soy mocha and delicious bulgogi sandwich. I became friendly with the staff since they were all amazing and kind as well. I miss this place after moving away!!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great place for quick breakfast coffee and sandwiches
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great little coffee and sandwich shop. Decent seating options given the small space. I recommend the iced latte.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Food was amazing and the line was worth it (about 12 people on a Sunday morning) location is cute inside and the staff was nice and joking around with each other. I got the cragel sausage and egg and my partner got the roast beef
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Small cafe with polite helpful staff. Not far from California and Powell which is a great spot for touristy photos. Got a coffee which was OK, not the best but a veggie bagel that was loaded with flavor and veggies."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"It feels pretty nice to have a warm and tasty coffee in a cold & rainy morning. We lived in Union square and had a hangover at the Saturday night. The first thing when I woke up on Sunday was looking for good coffees. Thankfully we found this coffee shop next to our hotel. I ordered a cappuccino and my husband had a cup of americano. Both of us loved it, it made our morning so relaxing and cozy."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great local coffee. Friendly staff and atmosphere. The coffee is tasty, fresh with a nice aroma and smooth. Breakfast sandwiches are freshly made and tasty."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Ate a lemon 🍋 cake 🍰.. hot chocolate with cookies 🍪 whipped cream on top and always.. good time with new member of family..

BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The BeanStalk Cafe was great for breakfast around there. The Bulgogi sandwich was good and had resonable price. And it had enough quantity to be my breakfast. Also, the staffs are very kind."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Stopped by to grab a sandwich for lunch. Super tasty!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The breakfast sandwhich was great; hearty, tasty and fulfilling. There was only one guy and a few people came in but he was patient and hardworking. He even hand delivered the food to the guest. Although that sandwich was $11, it was reasonable with SF price. I would come here again."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great coffee, baked goods okay but not fresh that day. All in all great spot for quick bite"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Really delicious coffee. It has a strong coffee flavor, at least the espresso does. I had a cragel breakfast sandwich, which was really fantastic."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The reviews made me want to try this spot, but it turned out to be disappointing. I ordered a iced chai tea latte and the latte tasted like cinnamon milk. I went back to have it remade and the barista unfortunately didn’t make a new one and just added a shot of espresso inside it (tasted the same). In addition, I got a egg and cheese on a croissant - the croissant was overly hard / stale and the egg did not seem fresh (looked like one of the ready made egg blocks)"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The cragels here are a must try. Coffee was really good also, and nice coffee shop ambiance. I'll definitely be back"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Really friendly staff and the sandwiches/bagels there were amazing! I really liked the small Italian bistro vibe it has.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Super cute cafe with yummy sandwiches and coffee with latte art. The staff was so sweet. Vibes are cozy!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,It was so nice and I came here twice during my stay. I recommend drip coffee and Bush street sandwich.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Really solid breakfast spot! The coffee is tasty, the staff is super helpful, and the bagel with cream cheese is simple but tasted fresh. Would recommend!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Quiet little coffee shop that has an extensive menu. Good lattes, mochas, & americanos. Asiago bagel and cream cheese was good as well. A couple of tables outside and a few more inside. Good place for dogs (outside only)."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Really nice staff and great food! Visited 3x in 3 days. Dine in and take out both great.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"PROS: - really good food! - good drink options, especially warm drinks for winter days - close enough to Union Square for conveniency, but far enough to avoid the crowd (and hence the wait typical at Union Square restaurants) - my friend had a sandwich, and I had a bagel, both have a lot of filling and is extra heavy, so we both had takeaway. Good price for portion!  CONS: - limited seating. You’d have to share tables if needed be."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Definitely I love it !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Staff super friendly !!! Thanks Mylo 👍 …
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The sandwich is a bit dry, the taste is not mellow in every bite. The taste of coffee is not good, I feel like drinking instant coffee."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Super cute little bagel/breakfast sandwich cafe. Delicious lattes and tasty food. Not a lot of seating so I recommend coming prior to 8:30 AM.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Absolutely fabulous.  The best sandwich and coffee in San Francisco.  We had Mina's veggie sandwich and also an egg sandwich, both were absolutely delicious.  Gorgeous bread and packed with super fresh fillings.  They have so much choice on their menu.  Highly recommended."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,BeanStalk Cafe is a quaint and comfortable Cafe to get great coffee and good food to start your day.  If f time permits relax and observe the hum of the city and if you are lucky the cute dogs that love to visit the Cafe.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Every so often you go to a place that just gets it. Affordable, delicious food and outstanding coffee."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The service was great, the cragel an interesting sandwich. Coffee is good, all in all a good choice for a hearty breakfast."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"We fled from the rain and found this perfect little café. Friendly staff and great roast beef sandwiches, tea & coffee. It's close to everything and has a very nice atmosphere."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,It’s a cozy place. The people in there are nice. I give them 2 stars because I didn’t like the coffee. The quantity versus price is good.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Best iced oat milk latte in San Francisco and nice staff :)
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Absolutely delicious flat white coffee and great breakfast sandwich too!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"They make a excellent Americano coffee, only let down by it being served in Cardboard cups."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Quaint little cafe with great coffee. Serves bagels, perfect place for a light breakfast."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I have allergies to egg and dairy products, so I searched for a vegan cafe on Google... unfortunately I can tack this onto my growing list of Google messups, because this place could barely accommodate me. However, I would say the staff here are very friendly, and tried their best. I had their only vegan option: Mim's veggies sandwich without the mayo sauces and cheese, which was good. I ordered a soy cappachino as well, which was too hot for the soy (for those of you who don't normally do coffee, it's when the soy is on the verge of burning and so the foam doesn't set properly), but I'm grateful they had the option. If I didn't have allergies, I'd come here for sure!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Very good food, a little slow but it was Sunday morning when we visited.  Tea was delicious, had the bush st breakfast sandwich which was huge  (couldn't finish it).  Great little cafe spot."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Visited during a quiet time of day (1.45pm). Service was exceptionally slow (12mins for a simple order). When delivered, cream cheese bagel was at least ""day-old"" bread, and perhaps older. Coffee (Flat white) was thin and runny, and particularly bitter. Probably one of my worst Quick-Lunch experiences for many a month. A sad member of San Fran's otherwise excellent Cafe set...."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"A perfect place to have brunch!  The background music was enjoyable, the staff were accommodating, and the food was on-point!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Good spot for breakfast with decented prices. Outstanding service
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Wonderful little spot with delicious coffee (my latte was incredible), delicious sandwiches (I had the lox bagel), and very kind people behind the counter. This a a great breakfast spot and I am sure the lunch would be fantastic too. Nice indoor seating and a few outdoor chairs to sit and watch the cable cars go by."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"A petite spot in SF. Ideal to grab something quick and leave, not for working. Still nice place."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great everything. Bagels are awesome. Coffe superb.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Ordered the Bush St Morning Sandwich. Delicious stuff. Good focused cafe food.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Amazing food and great staff! I ordered the egg and cheese on Asiago bagel. It was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked inside. The iced berry tea is tart and delicious. All in all, a perfect way to start your day."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Delicious sandwhiches and friendly service. Although food took a while to prepare, it was done thoughfully. Would recommend!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I had the breakfast sandwich with egg, sausage and veggies. The bread was deliciously toasted. Crispy and buttery. Recommend for breakfast!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Lovely small cafe with friendly staff!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great breakfast sandwiches and espresso, friendly staff, quick service"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Staff is friendly and coffee is good. I ordered the avocado sandwich which had a trace of avocado and mushrooms and mostly consisted of lettuce
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great little coffee and sandwich shop ... had breakfast there most days when we were staying in a hotel across the road. Breakfast sandwich in a bagel was very good.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,All around great place. Interesting layout and decor. Good food and good prices.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Had a terrible experience here this morning. I ordered a bagel with egg and cheese and some veggies and a grilled cheese sandwich. I was charged $17 for the veggie bagel. Apparently, if you want veggies added to your bagel they charge you an abused amount for the veggies. The sandwich was in no way worth $17. It was small and tasteless and barely had any veggies. They also forgot to put in my grilled cheese order so I had to wait for that which made me late to my morning meeting.  Overall, I wouldn’t go back to this place because they unjustifiably overcharge for bland food."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Have been coming here since they opened, and the food quality and service has been consistently great. Love the sandwiches!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Good coffee, eats and friendly staff. Nice place to come if your waiting for your laundry across the road."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Cute, small cafe, with a wide selection of breakfast sandwiches and coffee. The sandwiches are large, so large my family saved the other half for lunch. Had the Bulgoli sandwich, Breakfast Special sandwich and pesto grilled cheese - all delicious. My husband enjoyed the drip coffee. Great place."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great breakfast Cafe in union square. Tried the Crogel sandwich and spicy chicken sandwich and they were DELICIOUS. Also had the coffee and it tasted great.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,The man checking me out was so helpful! He was so nice and happy first thing in the morning. They were also playing really nice music. It was really clean inside. It helped that the weather was gorgeous on this morning! Thank you for helping me find a vegetarian dish
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great selection of breakfast sandwiches and coffee’s - would recommend trying the cragel sandwhiches (croissant + bagel)
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"A really nice café close to the Union Square. Although quite tiny, it has outlets and great wifi. So everything you would need for a good study session. On top of that, you even have incredibly tasty sandwiches and super nice staff. Big recommendation for whoever is looking for a good snack after a long shopping tour."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,The 'Cragel' (half croissant/half bagel) is neither. But transcends expectation and is hard to compare.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Cute cafe with mostly indoor and a little outdoor seating. I did not order any coffee but tried their chicken sandwich and it was scrumptious!! Although it takes quite a while (around 10mins) to prepare and there it was packed when I was there, which was around 10 am on a Sunday."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Good food, nothing really special. Coffee was very tasty!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Amazing new Cafe that actually does coffee right. If you here you must try it!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Hands down one of the best breakfast sandwich places around! Their croissant bagel hybrids taste SOOOO good that I swear I dreamt about it that night. Peaceful spot to relax, study, or read and eat a great breakfast, you won't regret it!!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This is a sweet neighborhood coffee shop that is also downtown. A couple of tables and chairs outdoors (as of now, but could change with the recommendations of the Governor) very good espresso drinks, great menu for breakfast items and a list of sandwiches that would rival anywhere. It is very clean and well organized but I have to say the staff is really welcoming and pleasant. So all in all I highly recommend Beanstalk Coffee, a coffeehouse as it should be."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Large and tasty sandwich. Good coffee.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Perfect flat white, delicious bagels, fast and good service!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"the seating is communal here, so be prepared to share a table. Our server was awesome and very attentive. I'd definitely come back again during a nice warm sunny day to enjoy their outdoor services!We have been to dinner here several times, and always enjoy our food. We have had their tamale plate, chicken fajitas, and their Mexican dinner. The complimentary chips & salsa are some of the best in town if you enjoy spice! The location is difficult to get to but once you follow the GPS for your first visit you'll never forget."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I love their breakfast sandwich (Eggs, cheese, sausage and bacon). What ever you order, you must to try it on Cragel bread (Bagel + Croissant), it's heaven. Their coffee is great too."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Best chai I had this week I have been in San Francisco and bagel was surprising good as well. Only wish I found this place  earlier in my trip to SF.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Delicious Bagel Sando and Flat white coffee
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Delicious fresh sandwiches!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Delicious. I just had their Nina’s veggie sandwich and it was phenomenal. Very fresh ingredients with a warm and crunchy bread. Yum. I also STRONGLY recommend their pour over coffee. I had the Colombian one and it was very flavourful. What a great find!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I love everything about this place.  Coziest, charming decor and amazing sausage, egg and cheese sandwich.  My latte was the creamiest and my husband felt the same about his choices.  The owner and staff were beyond nice and I am going back soon because they now have Pinkberry frozen yogurt!!!!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Visiting from Seattle, and tried a cappuccino here.  This might be a nice little cafe for food in general, but not a coffee enthusiast place.  My drink was sour and I only drank a sip or two."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Awesome breakfast! Got sausage cragel sando and pour over Ethiopian coffee. Expensive for breakfast, but so worth it! The guy making it was so nice too! Def recommend for quick nice breakfast"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I was just visiting from New York and luckily found this wonderful little cafe.  The food and drinks there are simply amazing, and served with a smile and caring attitude that was incredibly refreshing to this New Yorker!  I stayed in the area for 4 days and had or picked up my breakfast there every morning.   Yeah!  It was THAT GOOD!!  If you are in the Union  Square area, GO to the beanstalk! You will not be disappointed!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This is a cute little coffee place just off all the hustling from union square. You'll find a lot of locals here just enjoying a cup of good coffee. They are also good for a light and quick breakfast or brunch. I love their interior - super high ceilings, a lot of light and very modern and cool. It has a good amount of hipster vibe to it and they certainly take it serious preparing your espresso or sandwich. You'll always get a smile from the barista. They also serve slow drip coffee which tastes excellent. Seating is limited but usually you can always grab a table."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Small cafe vibe, chilled atmosphere, great roast beef sandwich, pour over coffee was ok."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,This is a great coffee shop that you can spend a lot of time hanging out in without knowing where the time went. I do like the coffee shop itself though!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Try the beef bugogi (Korean inspired) sandwich! It was simply amazing!!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Good food prepared while you wait. The owner and his wife are charming, warm with a good eye for similarly dispositioned staff. Popular with local residents because the food is consistently well prepared. The Union Square adjacent location attracts tourists from hotels and cable cars. Often has an international feel as a result. They expanded the space to add additional seating. You can still pop in for coffee a chat or small selection of baked goods. The sandwiches are good to take out if you prefer. Mornings expect a wait, particularly on weekends. Not inexpensive but, certainly a value.  They are opening a second location, I believe in the Sunset. Stay tuned."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great service! I ordered a matcha latte and a cragel... Matcha latte was decent. I was really looking forward to trying the cragel, but it was dry and tasted a few days old. Couldn't finish it :("
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Good taste. Wide range of choice including decaf. Nice atmosphere. I like this place.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Loved this little gem! Stopped in for coffee and breakfast sandwiches and they were so delicious! The cragel is soo good. Their lunch sandwiches looked amazing as well. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a local cafe. I will say the place is kinda small so if you visit while busy you’ll need to grab it to go cause not much seating.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Got in bright and early at 8am and was nice and quite. Absolutely loved the ☕️, best one around ! The crackle is worth a try... Super friendly staff."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Wonderful 3rd wave specialty coffee shop, serves contraband coffee which is a plus for me - and also incredible sandwiches. Price for sandwiches is circa $10-$15, but they are big portions and filling.  The egg salad is delicious, if a little onion heavy - but I normally can't stand anything too oniony and the egg salad bagel I got was so delicious I ate it all anyways! I've also had the veggie sandwich and that was delicious. Apple and cucumber for a natural crunch and sweetness, and savory side with the avocado. So nice. The turkey sandwich was stuffed with plenty of real non-processed deli-quality turkey, and was well balanced flavor wise with the spreads and toppings. The french bread they use is surprisingly close to a true french baguette in flavor and texture. Great crust, soft inside, so delicious. Really elevates the sandwich. They do dine-in or takeout for sandwiches, and they're wrapped well for takeout.  I've had a cappuccino, espresso, and black coffee here and all were delicious. Plenty of seating, one good long table ideal for a meeting.  I've not been able to make wifi work, and there doesn't seem to be any outlets or charging ports, so that's the one and only con of an otherwise wonderful place.  I recommend sitting outside, it's a lovely atmosphere. Lastly, get a bagel, not a cragel. Much better. That's a trendy item, but their regular stuff is done so much better here."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"They have a wonderful selection of breakfast items, bagels with cream cheese, bagel sandwiches, croissant sandwiches. They also have a very nice lunch menu, we will have to come back for lunch. We enjoyed some bagel sandwiches and a delicious cup of joe. We will be back the next time we are in San Francisco."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This cafe is small but bright and airy; it gets busy but the line moves quickly. There's a larger communal table (6-8 people) near the window and several smaller tables (1-3 people); at peak hours some tables are designated ""no computers/food only"" to keep things moving, although the staff were pleasant and didn't rush anyone. Menu has an extensive selection of sandwiches, bagels, cragels (a few vegetarian options) and drinks (with a focus on espresso-based drinks but with other options too). My sandwich was delicious and came on ciabatta that was toasted just right. Overall, a good place for a quick breakfast stop for small groups (<5 people). I look forward to coming back to try more of the menu!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great place to grab a table for some remote work, amazing coffee drinks and bites/sandwiches"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"If you're reading this review just come to Beanstalk. It's has great coffee and a great staff. The place is larger since the expansion (obviously), but still isn't a spot to bring a large group.  The breakfast sandwich and cold brew are one of my favorite weekend morning treats."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great spot for coffee and snacks. It's a bit blurry since we went here a couple months ago but I think we had this really yummy bugogi sandwich. Filled with tender and flavorful meat on some toasty bread, it hit the spot! The cafe is quite small with minimal seating. Service was great! Super nice staff and our orders came out fast."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great lattes and really tasty veggie sandwich with gochujang
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I have only ever gone here for lunch but I really like the sandwiches. Although the sandwich prices pack a heavy San Francisco price, they are very filling. I can usually only eat just a sandwich for lunch with no sides. They use quality ingredients, vegetables and freshly made bread. All sandwiches are toasted in the oven and come with sauces and veggies unless you specify what you don't want. Service is usually quick if you catch them at the right time but they will get a nice sized lunch rush. Only have had a few occasions where new sandwiches makers have taken longer then normal but that won't stop my from still giving this place 5 stars. My personal favorites are the Spicy Chicken and the Bulgogi Beef sandwiches."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This a great neighborhood place get a sandwich or other things that isn't too far from the more commercial establishments that surround Union Square (SF). The service can be slow, but worth the wait. The photo is of my terrific veggie sandwich that I ate outside in the sun in Union Square."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Clean place!  Sandwich was very good.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"During my trip to San Francisco, I walked into this cafe for breakfast. I had Bush Street breakfast sandwich - Wow, Awesome!! Just perfect! I received kind service, wood tables are beautiful, the cafe has relaxing environment."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,I really want to like this cafe but it always seems to disappoint somehow. I've been many times as it's in my neighborhood. I've never been able to get a cragel despite more than 10 visits. Today they made my soy cappuccino with normal milk. While I waited for the new one they suddenly restocked on cragels but the cashier didn't inform me even though she knew I requested one. When I asked to switch it was already too late. Customer service just seems lacking for the high prices. Happy to take my business elsewhere.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Have eaten their cragel and bulgogi sandwich. Both are good, but not amazing. Pretty heavy meals. Probably better off getting a good bagel instead of their cragel.  Also hard to find seating during brunch / breakfast / lunch hours. Nice atmosphere for a small coffee shop though"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I wanted to grab a quite bite to eat and a cup of coffee for brunch and found this place on Yelp. It was right across the street from the hotel that I was staying at.  There's a couple chairs out front and about 1-2 small tables inside. They had some pastries and a small menu posted.  After reading some Yelp reviews, I decided to try their Bulgogi sandwich and a cup of coffee. Sadly, they ran out of the toast cups.  The bulgogi sandwich was really good. The meat was flavored well and they gave generous portions. The bread was a baguette and it was nicely toasted. It had a nice crunch every time I bit into it.  However, the coffee was just ok. I'm not sure what brand they use but I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.  Overall, it's a cute cafe. I think it's a good place to come and get a cup of coffee and/or a sandwich/pastry to-go."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Amazing food that will rock your taste buds. The toast cups are a genius creation by the owner. She is extremely kind and makes sure you love your food. The bulgogi sandwich will knock your taste buds out of the park. Can't recommend this place enough!!!!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great place. Sandwiches made with love : bul go-gi sandwich is great, spicy chicken also and vegetarian too. Cragel not so much (a matter of taste I guess). Quality of the cappuccino varies with the employee making it, but still 10x better than Starbucks (more ""European style"" at the Beanstalk, not drenching the coffee-taste in a lot of milk). Spicy is just very mild spicy, which is good. Lots of salad on the sandwiches."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,We went during Thanksgiving Holidays. I has a vegan sandwich and it was just great! You can feel it is the neighborhood coffee shop. The owner is very friendly. I loved it!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,The veggies sandwich is very tasty. It's different from what I have before. Very refreshing. Coffee is good also.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Breakfast was fine, i did not like how the staff make sandwiches and ring people out without washing their hands in between or using gloves. That was a turn off. The sandwiches tasted fine, i got the egg salad on a ""cragel"" which is a combination between a bagel and crossaint- that was good. We ordered sausage, egg and cheese. My friend ordered avocado and paid extra for it but it was not added to the sandwhich. Nevertheless, if your on the run and need fuel asap, stop at this place it was fine."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Got the cragle  with is a  Croissant shaped like a bagel. With cheese bacon and egg. With a coffee. Just the right amount of food. Great coffee too. Enjoyed the good food
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Nice people. Nice food.  Much too slow - wasn’t even crowded.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Small and pleasant cafe, specialising in sandwiches, bagels and cragels (tried our first ever cragel and it was a winner). Lots of fillings to hopefully suit all tastes and according to the wife the coffee was decent too. Unfortunately sold out of breakfast tea (grumpy Englishman abroad 😲). Staff were friendly, the service quick and the right level of background music."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Legit breakfast options made quick by what appears to be knowledgable staff. Nice cozy cafe. The cashier/waitress/owner(?) is friendly/competent/cute. I probably have stricter criteria than this for most days but really, can't find any complaints here."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Interesting place. Pretty nice service. Food... Not so much. Breakfast sandwich was one of the worst I've had; dry bread, pre-made eggs, strange sausage. Espresso is decent."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"It has to he one of the finer mochas I have ever gotten. If you like your mochas creamy, then get one here. The food is also pretty good. It's not the best, but it's good. Fresh ingredients that really make a difference. The food is a bit on the pricey side, but if you're willing to spend a little more, I recommend coming to this place."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Long wait marrs the place but the bulgogi sandwich and the bread it was on was pretty good. However, not sure it was worth $11+tip. Tight space. Ended up sitting with others at a large table, which was fine, but a bit too cozy to be relaxing."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Not sure if lunch is better, but this came up as one of the top places for breakfast in the neighbourhood. That it definitely isn’t. Three choices of sandwich for breakfast, I got the cragel (croissant bagel) without meat, and a coffee. $16.00 and worse than food at Einstein Bagels or Panera."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I had a breakfast sandwich and it was not very good. The eggs are microwaved, the bagel was small and over toasted. I probably wouldn't go back."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Cute little cafe with a nice selection of sandwiches. I tried the pesto grilled cheese which comes on toasted ciabatta. The pesto is flavorful and the cheese is melted evenly. I also got a hot chocolate which was good.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Beanstalk serves delicious (and overpriced) breakfast sandwiches, but what else do you expect from a place near Union Square? I'd recommend a breakfast sandwich (made right in front of you, so you know its fresh) and a latte - walk down the block and enjoy them at a table in Union Square.  Weekends the line can be a bit long, but if you have some time to kill its worth it."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Burnt coffee. The bagel was good.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,The sandwiches here are the perfect start to any day. The cragle is a particular favorite. Perfectly toasted to make an amazingly flakey and tender bite to balance the fillings. And this wouldn't be complete without a coffee made on par with the best coffee shops in town.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Hole in the wall cafe spot and not too fast of a turn time for scrumptious bakery goods to come out of their oven. I wanted to try their toasted cups, but they said they ran out. I ordered their mint mojito coffee and they ran out of mint. Limited supply for a small cafe storage I suppose, to function. Few seatings and not the ideal bring-your-stuff to do work here for awhile cafe. I prefer that cafe vibe. The norm on coffee and sandwich menu. I left unimpressed."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Really good sandwiches. For most locals the prices are normal, but for someone who's not used to paying 10 bucks for a sandwich, this may be a bit pricy.  Try the Spicy Chicken w/a little extra spicy sauce, its not hot, but has a nice kick to it.  They do run out of some items. While this is a bit of an annoyance, they only make a certain amount of food and once it runs out, it runs out.  They are very conscious about this. If they run out at 3, try getting there by 2 or 1... That's what most of us do :) especially if you like the way they make their food."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Best coffee I had in SF!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"The BEST Americano I've ever had!!  Nice froth and a smooth finish.  The water is filtered and fluoride is removed making every cup and variation of coffee absolutely delicious.  I have traveled all throughout Europe, Asia and the US and have visited some incredible cafe's.  This is by far the best for Americano.  A simple cup that can expose a weak bean, grind or barista (to which they are not!).  The BeanStalk Cafe has it going on.  The owner was in when I was with a colleague and he was very personable.  I wish you all the success you deserve.  I will be stopping in on all of my visits to San Francisco!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Coffee is delicious. Bagels are yum according to hubby. No gluten free options, unless you wanna buy an apple. not suited for celíacs :("
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great hip cafe with nice selection of coffee and bites. Very friendly staff.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Nice little cafe with really tasty sandwiches. Came back the next morning and also enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"There's Roasted and then there's Burnt. This coffee was the latter. Don't know if it was a bad day or how it always is, but it was not good"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Came here on a Sunday morning. There were a few people in front of us but it wasn’t crazy. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches to go and it took 25 minutes for us to get our sandwiches.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Toast cup was the perfect size.  Owner was very friendly.  Trying mojito coffee next time. Reserving our appetite for a seafood lunch at the wharf.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great sandwiches on Bush St. The shop is very small so seating may be hard to find, but the food is great. It's near Union Square which makes it a great place to eat if there's no room in the restaurant."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Tiny cafe with only a handful of seats but with an awesome menu of food and coffee choices. The spicy chicken sandwich was great, and the mocha was deliciously chocolatey."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Disappointing, given the high rating here. Ordered a beef sandwich and a flat white. The beef was not good, lots of fat and gristle. Flat white was steamed much too hot for a flat white and had too much milk."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great small place to get coffee and breakfast sandwich.  We got the cragle breakfast and latte before headed out to the airport.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Great iced coffee. The food can take a little while to prepare, but it is worth the wait. There's a good amount of seating and plenty of tables."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Good coffee, cragel, WiFi, out door seating, gender neutral bathroom, and friendly baristas. Also love their music <3 (Only thing is no outlets)"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Fast service even in rush hour
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Cozy place. Workers shifted their duties among cashier making coffee and making sandwiches. They are all very friendly. Espressos is a two dollar espresso.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Delicious coffee and bagels, my fav breakfast place in SF!"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Get their toast cup! They are my favorite on the way to work but they usually run out by 9am. It's a cozy little coffee shop with not much space. They only have one table and some bar seats.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Had soy latte and hungarian coffee cake.  Soy latte was better than average but little less soymilk would be better.  Coffee cake was pretty good.    Owner is super nice
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Quiet place, good coffee and food. Service a bit unhelpful. My wife wanted an iced coffee and they said they didn't have anymore. But we see many peolple after us getting theirs... maybe communication problem, but again, not very helpful"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Food and drink were alright. Good amount of food, good amount of seating although no available power outlets."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Try the pour down coffee. Brilliant. Good breakfast choices. Reasonable prices. Happy, smile-filled service."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,One of the best sandwiches and coffee I’ve ever had… 100% recommended
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This was our go to breakfast place when staying on knob hill. The walk down and up is worth it! Great service, delicious food, perfect coffee."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Had a great coffee and bagel egg and cheese all fresh made. Probably would have earned 5 stars if I didn't go with a basic order
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Coffee was good but the food wasn't fresh. My sandwich had the ""fridge"" taste because the veggies were clearly cut and stored too long"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"good food, good coffee, takes a few minutes to have your sandwich made. nice quiet spot to work or study. WiFi available"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Cute place but got my order wrong. :(  the latte was great but the drip coffee sucked.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Fabulous coffee and nice bagels (not overly toasted, plenty of cream cheese). My husband had the bagel sando with sausage and loved it :)"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"loved that bagel, thanks ☺️"
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Nicest coffee I had whilst visiting San Francisco.  Gem of a cafe. Get out of your hotel and have breakfast here. Great sandwich and bagel too
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,A nice and quiet cafe with great sandwiches and friendly staff.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Cozy, minimalist place for drip, espresso, and pourovers. They also have a fairly extensive food menu and various pastries. The pourover I had was solid."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Very good coffee. Five stars for the croissant bagel egg sandwich... It was truly excellent.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Good bagel but the amount of cream cheese they put on is pathetic
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Only thing I tried was their coffee, it was Super weak coffee and not very tasty. I'd compare it to Dunkin donuts, except DD doesn't charge $3 for their colored water."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,So nice bagel with super nice cheese and soft scrambled egg. Girls are really busy but kind! Enjoy
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Omg! Best cafe. I love the staff here. Must try bagels and coffee in SF.

BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I have to admit, the first time I came here I was a bit underwhelmed by the coffee. I first tried the cold brew and the cappuccino and both were good, but nothing too amazing."

BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Great coffee
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"This was my third time at this establishment. I first went 2 years ago when I was in SF and returned because the food is fresh, beverages are good and the service is friendly. The lox bagel was great!  It gets crowded otherwise I would have given the atmosphere 4 stars…hard to get a table at times."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Bul-go-gi beef sandwich. Get it.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,We stumbled across this cafe today and were very pleased. We chose the veggie bagel in the Daily Specials menu and it was the right decision. Very very tasty bagel. Coffee was very strong but good by American standards. The service was very nice and polite. I can only recommend!
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,Very good baggel for morning breakfast. Pleasant service. The coffee was too bitter and strong acid for my taste. The milk chocolate was very well executed.
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"A warm pastrami sandwich to kneel in and nice service, I really liked going there more often. There's only a small deduction for the many hipsters, you almost never get a seat. But beware, the sweet counter offers many delicious temptations."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,lots of sheep I ate green onions and something with eggs in it Coke not sold A little bit of taste still delicious
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"We decided to have breakfast several times during our stay in the city. The bagels are delicious, highly recommended."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"Bagels taste very good, coffee and espresso too. Everything in self-service. Water is free. Great for breakfast or a small lunch. All bagels are also available as a croissant variant with a 25 percent surcharge. There are also sandwiches that cost a little more."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I ordered a morning sandwich after reading the reviews, and I liked the light taste of warm-roasted ciabatta with scrambled eggs. The owner is skilled, so I think the other menus are also delicious. But if you're near Union Square, it's worth a try, but it's not a great restaurant to visit from far away."
BeanStalk Cafe,724 Bush St,"I happened to come in while going to the laundromat, and decaffeinated coffee is also available! Two cups of coffee and a sandwich cost about $20, and it's really delicious.. Highly recommended"
