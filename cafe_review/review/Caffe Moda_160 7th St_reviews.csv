Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Sweet staff. A bit sketch location and reasonably pricey given the location ( got the ham egg cheese bagel sandwich. It was just right. Hit
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"We stayed at The Signature San Francisco and wanted some pastries for breakfast, so we set off walking and came across Caffe Moda. I am so glad we did! Everything we got was amazing. The apple fritter and the ham and cheese croissants were to die for. I love this place! The lady behind the counter was working her butt off but still managed to give great service. I would love to eat here again. Thank you!"
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Great place. Tea was great value. Also got a great value banh mi (Vietnamese roll) that was very tasty, great tofu, what more could you want. Very friendly and welcoming woman serving there."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Got a very large croissant it was very filling. However there are lots of homeless on the corner nearby that kinda take away from the atmosphere.
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,My Bride and I Loved this place. First day in Frisco from Chicago and ended up here. These peeps know their craft. Freshly squeezed OJ. Glazed donuts were super fluffy. Ham and Cheese croissant also delicious. Must try if your in town!!
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"I seriously LOVE this place! They make the most delicious breakfast sandwiches and they have a nice variety of freshly baked pastries for reasonable prices. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better chai latte, too (either hot OR iced - both are amazing) Just get there before 2pm - ya ain't got all day! 😋"
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"New owners! They make the Doughnuts on site, and they are Great.  Nice people who are doing  it right."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,The one lady staffed there was very excellent on how she made my drinks and the food was good and later on her helper came and he was very nice and accommodating as well :-) the atmosphere is simple but clean neat and tidy
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"A quick stop for your usual coffee. Nothing fancy, but the lady serving it is super nice and efficient."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"The breakfast sandwich that i had was great, but the secret is in the waffles. My sister had one and said it was the best waffle she's had anywhere in a long time.  Delicious milk shakes and smoothies. Very friendly service, and decent prices. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area again. (This breakfast was better than the one that i had to pay for at my hotel)"
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Tried it for the first time today. I got a turkey breakfast sandwich and it wasn't anything to rave about. My friend got 2 donuts and after he purchased it I noticed there was a bunch of small flies in the donut case. This place needs to work on cleanliness and address the small fly issues. Won't be going back
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"I took a $20 Uber ride here at 5am because they were one of the few restaurants that stated on Google they were open at that time.  They were closed.  Paid another $20 to go to Denny's several blocks away.  Thanks a bunch Caffe Moda.  Try updating your open times so you don't cost other potential customers over $20 each, I'm sure you've costed many of us thousands collectively by now."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"I absolutely love this Cafe. The sweetest lady usually works round the clock to satisfy her customers cravings. Super fresh, super friendly service, and another one of SOMA's hidden gems! Big up yaself Cafe Moda!👍🏽😘 …"
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,New ownership as of a few months ago. Some of the best donuts in town. Chocolate frosted is perfect and not too sweet like other places. Fresh made pastries. Have not tried their pasties yet but they look good.
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Awesome breakfast croissant sandwich and a good price. The owner is very friendly and pretty quick for what she is working with.
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Sweetest old lady works behind the counter great service good coffee.... Unfortunately the Young drug dealers are starting to try to take over the restaurant so I hope the police help her out before they intimidate her and to letting them sell out of the coffee shop..
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Their breakfast is bad compared to the price, and what you can find other places nearby."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Very clean.  Staff was attentive to tourists need for a meal with suggestions similar to a favorite breakfast while I was there.  Udate: sign today said ""Closed for catering"" which is an added option.  My friend felt her BLT could have had more than two strips of bacon for taste and price."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Friendly, neighborhood bakery! Love their banhmis and empanadas. They have fresh fruit juice as well. Always love coming down here to grab some juice, food or dessert."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"I love cafe Moda! Best coffee and baked goods,lovely dining area ,lots of breakfast and lunch choices. The folks who own and run the shop are great and friendly. Can't say enough about how great a coffee shop this is."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Ehh, I feel bad leaving this review so low but the food was ok, the place felt like a subway, and the only napkins were tissues. The lady that made the food was super nice and did her best to make everything by herself, but she seemed overwhelmed. The food was bland and over priced for what you got. :/ sorry."

Caffe Moda,160 7th St,From the outside it's not very inspiring but once inside you find the lady who takes care of the service very friendly and kind. The products such as brioche croissant beagle are fresh and very good to taste
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Good cafe near the center with very friendly Asian workers. The truth is that it is perfect to have breakfast and not get far from the interesting area of San Francisco and save some money, because the prices are affordable and the products have nothing to envy to those of other places. We had breakfast for two people for about 12.5 dollars, practically half what we paid the day before and we ate more or less the same thing. The place is quite large, with many chairs to sit comfortably and rest or look outside watching the busy life of downtown San Francisco, highly recommended and cheap, a shame we discovered it on the last day of our vacation"
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Normal breakfast (Royal Seven) at a maybe a bit overpriced in a small but clean restaurant. I especially liked the pancake, which was freshly fried in the pan. However, it is more of an pancake than a thick American pancake. There were four of us here and everyone was happy. Nothing special, but not bad either. Smoothies are different than you know them. The oatmeal is made with just water and is a bit bland. There are 9 tables for 4 people and an additional 7 bar stools in front of a large window.  I had the Royal Seven breakfast with 5 various items and it was good, but a little bit too expensive. The freshly made pancakes were delicious but a little different (thinner) than the commonly known. The smoothies were a bit different from what I know, too. There were for of us and everyone was satisfied, but not overwhelmed. The restaurant provides about 9 tables for 4 people and approximately 7 additional seats in front of a big window."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"If you want to have a good breakfast near the hotels in SOMA, don't look, this is the place to go. Very good reception and even in French. The food is good and cheap compared to trendy but overpriced cafes in the area."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Tasty food at a good price. We took Royal 7 each. 5 items to choose from plus coffee and juice.  We're definitely coming every day now while we're here in San Francisco.
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,"Simple coffee for quick American breakfast. Very good attention, good price."
Caffe Moda,160 7th St,Good simple breakfast!! To recommend!!
