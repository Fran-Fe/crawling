Good cup of coffee. managed by one person, she is a sweetheart.  Good service, friendly, not a large menu but has good breakfast items. Small wait, everything is made to order."

CoffeeSmith,401 Golden Gate Ave,"Very cute place, Philz was backed up so I popped in here. Greeted by the lady and eyes fell on the rows of gleaming Chinese baos . Asked for a regular cup of black coffee with shot of espresso and a bbq bao. There is a 5$ min for credit card use. Great cup of coffee, fresh and strong and the bao hit the spot. Would definitely come here again."
