Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"I started an internship near bluestone. I have never been a coffee girl but honestly bluestone made me get into coffee. I started buying the hot chocolate and the almond & chia putting both are amazing for a quick breakfast & go. You can order online and just grab. It’s kind of expensive since I ordered the hot chocolate and it was around $6-7 ish and it was small(look at pic) and the chia putting is also small and is around $6. The total for only those was $12.31. The chia pudding those make you fill full and is delicious. One problem is that when you order in person they don’t give you a receipt and you can really claim your points for the rewards. On the other hand, the location is always clean and the staff is always soooo nice. They are always smiling. It became one of my favorite coffee places <3  also really aesthetic for instagram"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,Beautiful coffee from Amy and perfect Avo Toast from Liz. Great coffee shop and lovely staff!
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"Amy is the BEST Barista I've had the pleasure of meeting. She's a true Aussie with a genuinely polite demeanour and bright outlook on life. She also makes the BEST flat whites (a rarity in America)! She made my day and I would recommend this cafe to anyone in San Fran! Thank you, Amy!"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"I absolutely loved the vibe, the atmosphere, the feel, the decor, and the color scheme of this café and restaurant. The gluten free avocado toast with a poached egg was okay. It needed salt. But I’d love to come back and try new things."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"From the moment I entered, I was made to feel very welcome indeed. The staff couldn't have been more cheerful, and the ordering process was seamless. I thoroughly enjoyed the avocado toast but the real draws were the bright surroundings & personable staff. Looking forward to many return visits!"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"Great space, rather a lot of seating so looks good for work as well. Friendly staff and quicke service. Tried a cappuccino with oat milk, it was very good, not the best I've had but I would definitely go back!"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"Nice Australian coffee shop offering full coffee menu, sandwiches, and light bites. Great location, with lots of seating and open windows. Reasonably priced for the neighborhood. Really good avocado toast 🥑 …"
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,Came here to pick up a Neighbor Bakery hazelnut raspberry croissant because we were nearby and didn’t want to drive to Dogpatch. The lady working there seemed very disinterested in serving us (unlike most bluestone lane staff I’ve come across in other locations). The croissant was also quite disappointing. It was quite soggy inside (see photo). It was before noon when I got it so it shouldn’t have become so stale if it was delivered in the morning. I highly doubt that bluestone lane will sell day-old croissants? But this one had truly underwhelming texture and is $1.05 more than if you get it from Neighbor.
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"Shop has a decent atmosphere, but the drinks are mediocre and the wait is super long."
Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,55 2nd St,"Awesome toasts and drinks. I got the prosciutto toast and my friend got the avocado toast. The avocado toast was boasting with avocado and seasoned very well. The prosciutto was well balanced with tomatoes, lettuce and cheese."
