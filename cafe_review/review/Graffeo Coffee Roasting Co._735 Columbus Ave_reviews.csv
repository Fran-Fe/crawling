Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,I've purchased coffee from Graffeo's since the early 1970s. It's three best coffee in the world!
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"Graffeo roasts some the best coffee in the Bay Area, maybe the world... No, really! A local treasure for the true coffee connoisseur!"
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"Graffeo roasts dark. If you like light roasts this ain't your place. I'm a fan of african beans roasted just past first crack so I don't like Graffeo. Nothing wrong with them and if you like full city plus, go here."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"Finally a San Francisco roastery that does something else than just the light sour roasts you get anywhere. You get into the store and it already smells really delicious, the staff was super sweet and can tell you lots about the beans you are purchasing."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,I would give Graffeo six stars if I could.  I've been buying coffee beans roasted by Luciano since 1979.  His roasts are simply the best in the world. Stay well and see you on my next trip to SF - Vincenzo
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,Graffeo is the best coffee roaster in San Francisco. They supply the finest restaurants  the city. I have been using their beans since 1974 and even had them shipped to me during the years I lived in Texas. It was one of the factors that caught the attention of my wife when I first met her. I think she was attracted to my coffee before she was attracted to me!
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"Graffeo is overrated coffee. Flavor is mediocre at best. Made Graffeo coffee with a French press and it still lacked good, robust flavor. Want great coffee flavor with great prices? Head over to Caffe Trieste for your coffee beans. Trieste coffee is fifty times better than Graffeo"
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"I went because the description said it was a coffee shop. Disappointing, THEY DO NOT SERVE COFFEE but it was a great find for what they do best... roast coffee beans. The gentleman there was super nice and pointed me towards Mario's nearby for a cup using their beans. It was fantastic and I returned after to buy some delicious smelling beans that were recently roasted."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"One of the best coffee roasters in the area. They keep things simple with only three options: dark roast, light roast, and decaf. They don't aggressively distribute like Four Barrel or Sightglass or Equator, but I often prefer Graffeo's flavor profile for brewing at home."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"We live in Sacramento and have quite a few roasters here and they all use and offer single source beans.  I personally much prefer blends which when done correctly, make the coffee or espresso much more flavorful and less ""sour"" to my taste.  Graffeos has THE best blend of beans and the roast is absolutely perfect.  Crema galore with our machine and it is now hard to drink anything else. Besides...they pack and sell the beans by the pound...not some cheesy-ass 12oz bag. If they keep selling it, I'll keep buying it."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"We have been ordering from. GRAFFEOS for over 20 years! We LOVE their coffee. People often ask us ""What coffee is this?"" BTW their decaf is the best we've ever found!"
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"I purchased a pound of whole bean to run through my espresso machine. Their roast is as dark as you could go without spontaneously combusting. What puzzles me is that the roastery does not have an espresso machine to test their batches and were not able to tell me anything about ratios or flavor notes. I'm sure their beans are fine for a brew machine, but there are far better options for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy quality espresso."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"I have been coming here for 20+ years. It is still one of the finest roasts and beats Ritual, Sightglass, 4 Barrel, and Peets hands down for a dark roast. Seriously good flavor and holds a crema in espresso form. If you want to try it before you buy it, get an espresso at Mario's Bohemian Cigar Shop. You'll be hooked."
Graffeo Coffee Roasting Co.,735 Columbus Ave,"I when there to purchase a pound of grounded Coffee, I owner deliver outstanding customer service. The Coffee is amazing!"
