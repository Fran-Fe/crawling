Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Hands down the most welcoming cafe I’ve discovered in SF so far. All the staff are super nice, especially Lulu! Great menu items at a very good price. The Focaccia bread on Fridays is phenomenal! Definitely worth stopping by if you’re near the Polk street area."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"It's a great place, everyone is super nice and the food and coffee is great. The egg and avocado sandwich is the best. Really tasty and keeps you full for a long while. I tried the waffle and it was delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of whipped cream, but the one they use was soft (not dense as from the can)."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,I ate here for lunch in my first full day in San Francisco. It is very well priced for the area. I’ve had the drip coffee which was smooth and cheap which was exactly what I was looking for. I also had a chicken Bah Minh which was good quality made with care. The chicken was ok not exactly what I was looking or hoping for for but still good and the service was fantastic. Very friendly and personable. I would recommend if you are visiting the nearby famous Lombard Street.
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Salsa Sunrise: Pictured. Delicious, toasty waffle with jalapeño and lots of toppings. Great way to start the day and be not too full."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"The Fueling Station is hands down one of the best spots on Polk. Their coffee is phenomenal (and imo, much better than many of the actual coffee shops nearby), their breakfast sandwiches are truly fantastic, and the staff are so friendly and so sweet. Thanks for making many of my mornings much better!"
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"We had a lovely breakfast with the folks at Fueling Station. The Banh Mi was lovely. Understated but carefully crafted flavor and texture to the carrots, cucumber, and chicken. And a perfect, wonderful light warmth from the spice in the sauce. Great recommendation by the owner.  The banana bread made in house (which the owner made today and offered the recipe for) was excellent and moist - totally reminiscent of my grandmother’s banana bread.  We also had a hot Chaga drink, a cold chaga drink, and a cortado, all with milk alternatives (oat and coconut). Served in for-here glasses/mugs by default. Lovely presentation and flavor. A slight aside: the iced chaga doesn’t seem to get cold quickly perhaps because of the thickness of the liquid. Definitely interested in these functional additives for coffee.  The owner was very personable and was the primary worker in the shop with 3 others. We own a coffee shop on Cape Cod in Massachusetts and I sat inside to observe the coffee process. From what little I did observe (audibly), the owner’s milk steaming is smooth - no frothing, no screaming. I think we made her nervous, telling her we had our own shop, so she offered to bring the cortado. She needed to dial the espresso in again (boy can we appreciate that). She apologized for the wait and even gifted us a bag of their house/espresso roast for the wait.  Would definitely recommend The Fueling Station. Great product, place, and people. Our first experience of the day in SF…and one of the best - certainly the best coffee experience."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Fueling Station Cafe is a standout establishment that excels in delivering delicious pastries, satisfying lunches, and a diverse coffee menu. As a loyal patron, I've come to appreciate their hot chaga drink, which never fails to impress.  The credit for the cafe's success goes to Lily, the owner, who has skillfully managed and developed the business since its inception. Her dedication and business acumen are evident in every aspect of the cafe's operation, creating a welcoming atmosphere for customers to enjoy their dining experience. Fueling Station Cafe is a testament to Lily's vision and hard work, making it a must-visit spot for food and coffee enthusiasts."

Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Food 5/5 The Chagacchino (Chaga cacao, cinnamon, vanilla, and monk fruit sweetener) was delightful. Quiche was savory and fresh. Service 5/5 The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and fast. Physical space/ ambiance 5/5 The cafe is spacious with two tables a tall and a normal height one. Some outdoor seating and smaller personal tables. The place was clean and tidy. Will definitely return."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,Very clean place and super nice staff. Very aware of gluten contamination and knowledgeable about what they can serve you. A few options and even some things from a local bakery!
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"My favorite SF cafe for working, meeting, or otherwise sitting and enjoying a Bahn Mi (pastries and other meal offerings are also excellent) and a good cuppa. The Fueling Station is a local family-run business, and Lulu and crew have created a warm and welcoming space to relax amidst the hustle and bustle of SF."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Friendly local coffee shop in a cool neighbourhood Excellent coffee and delicious, moist banana nut bread ."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Amazing range of coffeeshop meals, great attention to detail. Very friendly staff.  Pleasant space to sit for a while, does not feel like a place to work for an extended period though - the seating and setup is not conducive and comfortable (too large shared tables, a fairly noisy space).  Planning to come here again for a quick meal when I'm in the area."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Unassuming spot on Polk street , very delicious morning breakfast sandwiches for a good price for the city. They even have gluten free bread. Sandwiches and other breakfast options are customizable which makes them a solid option that can cover a bigger crowd food choices wise. Limited seating inside and outside though. Probably can seat 20-25 people."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Banh Mi Sandwich - delicious Cold Brew - full of flavor notes and SMOOTH (low acidity). Staff - friendly, warm, welcoming. If you live near by you're doing yourself a disservice by not stopping by here on a regular basis. Picture is the pork Banh Mi and wow was it tasty, the bread is just the right amount of crunch."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Friendliest staff I have ever encountered at a breakfast place, bagels were a bit flat but amazing lox regardless— breakfast waffle with avocado was amazing"
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,Super good food! Staff were very nice!There is also a clean bathroom.
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Second time I try to get a tofu Banh Mi and second time I got it with meat! I really want to try it, but I DON'T EAT MEAT!! I mean, maybe I don't understand and this is the next level tofu that looks, tastes and feels like pork (according to my friends that ate it).  2 times tho! Common!! :("
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,Enjoyed our coffee and the service was quick and friendly. Such a nice neighborhood to walk around.
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"A surprisingly awesome coffee place that also happens to have excellent food. Or maybe it’s the other way around.  Proper shots for sure.  It can get a little heck-tick and confused when it gets really busy.  Outdoor seating also, and limited street parking.  Service was fast and super friendly. Great, cozy neighborhood spot."
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Good coffee, good food, and the best chocolate muffins in SF and banana bread serve here!"

Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,Good price and food👌👌
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,I went there for breakfast as it was close to my hotel. I specifically wanted oatmeal and it was the place. The oatmeal was good. Good size portion and delicious. However coffee americano tasted sour. They were nice enough to make me another fresh cup and it tasted slightly better but still bad. Quite disappointing. Something must be wrong either with the beans or with the coffee making process. Staff were nice and friendly.
Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Great owner and manager who manage to provide tasty and healthy food at rock bottom prices ;  This is my fueling stop before tennis . It’s  hearty bowl of oatmeal, full of fruits and nuts is my daily staple. Sumptuous Vietnamese Sandwiches ( vegetarian or vegan) are my favorites.  Great place to read and study ;  superb internet connection. Friendly service making it a great neighborhood place !  Egalitarian cafe for democrats & aristocrats  !"

Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Excellent! Great prices for being in gorgeous Russian Hill. Food was delicious and service was spectacular.

Every staff makes nice coffee, Oat, soy, coconut, and almond are non dairy options. Has good Wifi, 5 outside tables.  Last time i got a smaller amount coffee than i always get(always full, but this time was way smaller) which was a bit disappointing, but still good coffee, i'll be back."

Fueling Station Cafe,2436 Polk St,"Dirty chai w/ almond milk and honey and the salmon toast were perfect! Fueling station is in a quieter spot on Polk, with a great selection of teas, breakfast options, chips, breads, sweets, and drinks!  Update: I've now gotten out of line at Saint Frank twice to head to FS instead - dirty chai is so much better and so is the food selection (which is nonexistent at St F).  ALSO they have a HH for tea and food, but I forget the details."
