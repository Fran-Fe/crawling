The owner was there and he’s super friendly and helpful. I had a chai and a pastry. It’s inside the larger building, so you won’t see a sign outside— walk past the escalators and you’ll find it!"
Daily Habit,1 Maritime Plz,"Best breakfast burrito in the area. Started going into the office more just because it means I get to have a breakfast burrito. Not sure what's their secret, but it's worth it. Support local businesses when you can!"
Daily Habit,1 Maritime Plz,Best Coffeeshop in SF!! Very affordable and the owner and his family are very very nice and friendly!!! Would 100% recommend!
Daily Habit,1 Maritime Plz,Fantastic coffee and breakfast burritos. Stumbled upon it the first day of my trip and went back the second day because it was so good. Gruff owner jokes around with regular clients.
Daily Habit,1 Maritime Plz,"Very friendly, and surprisingly good breakfast burrito... I always get skeptical when I see 'best this or that...' but it really was great. Good cook on the eggs, buttery, right amount of cheese, and the pico was great. Will defiybe back when I hike to the SF FiDi again!"
