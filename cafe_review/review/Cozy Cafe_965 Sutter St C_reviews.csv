Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Food is just amazing The service is great and as the name calls “cozy” atmosphere We tried sandwiches, pancakes, eggs, coffee, toast and everything was amazing"
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"The wife found this place on Google maps....so glad she did. The service was exceptionally great, fast, and satisfying. 3 Beautifully Spirited Ladies running the place, and very accommodating. Food came to our table hot and ready to eat. Simply Delicious. Other customers coming in were obviously previous customers, very relaxing (cozy), in and out in minutes. A true taste of San Francisco (in my opinion)"
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Great, simple, clean cafe and breakfast restaurant.  This is one of the few places post-pandemic that relies on providing good value for money and serving more customers rather than simply jacking up prices and hoping for the best.  I like the values they stand for, and their breakfast sandwiches:)."
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,Great neighborhood place to eat in or take out. For me it's perfect for grabbing  homemade type sandwiches on my way to work or on a tight schedule and need something fast and inexpensive.
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"The french toast here is great, its not usually crowded, and the prices are half of any other breakfast place in sfo."
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Simple, but very tasty breakfast options available: from bagel, cheese sandwich to pancakes or muffins. Staff is great and extremely friendly. Prices are fair. If you want some good food for a good price served by friendly staff - we can highly recommend this place. A lot of locals come around for their daily breakfast/snack routine."

Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Tiny itty bitty place, very friendly ladies running it.  Great place to grab a quick bite!"
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,Amazing California bagel. Latte is okay. Great place overall 👍 …
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Foods OK, bagel with egg and cheese for $4.25. About the same as I pay at Starbucks. Rushed, cramped, as friendly as a McDonald’s. It will do, but not much more than that."
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,Very tasty! The best place ih this area
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,The ladies here always know my order whether I call ahead or order in person. They make a great BLT or breakfast sandwhich. Great for a quick bite.
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,We ate here almost everyday during our honeymoon. The girls behind the counter are so friendly and the food is absolutely delicious! We recommend the French toast and the San Francisco bagle! The OJ and the coffee are pretty amazing and the prices are very reasonable too!
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Wouldn't ever want to have breakfast here again. Eggs and pancakes are low grade, and the price is no different than the cafe further down the block that serves at a much higher quality. The eggs are served from a container, which is why you only get the scrambled option. You clearly see them microwave most of their menu. NOT HOME COOKED, just cheap instant packaged produce"
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"I highly recommend the Cozy Cafe! Wide selection of breakfasts, very delicious and the staff is very kind😊 …"
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,We stayes across the road in Vertigo Hotel and they dont do breakfast they recommended Cosy Cafe and it waa our go to place for Breakfast. The ladys are lovely and food is simple but great. Only place we found decent coffee whilst in USA. Highly recommend.

Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Not sure who/why anyone gives this a low review (or why there are so many honeymoon reviews), but this place is very good. Local place with local customers, very good, freshly made sandwiches, friendly service. A gem!"
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,Food very good. My english muffin was lovely and hot and the coffee was superb.much better than the other wishy washy stuff ive experienced so far on our trip to the usa.
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,Delicious!!! Hands down the best breakfast with quick and easy service. And the iced coffee will be in my dreams forever
Cozy Cafe,965 Sutter St C,"Love love love Cosy cafe. From the great staff to the food to the sheer ambience of the surroundings, you just can't beat it. First day there was at the cafe when two police officers came if with a ukelele to serenade the gorgeous girls behind the counter. To me Cosy Cafe is everything I wanted the Haight district to be - super friendly, relaxed, everybody chilling on their own vibe but all together and all relaxed. Unlike much of the Haight I think they've managed to recreate the sixties culture without trying hard at all - they're not trying to be cool, they just are. And the coffee is to die for."
