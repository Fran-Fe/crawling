Not Latte,2142 Irving St,Very cute little coffee shop provides something different than regular latte selection. My daughter doesn’t drink coffee so we ordered avocado and mango milk it tastes surprisingly great! Love the new invention with fresh fruits. Great customer service here too. Will come back to try different flavor next time :)
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Everything about the mango not-latte seems  like it shouldn't exist. I have never considered   enjoying a sweet fruit alongside coffee because you would just assume that the strong, bitter flavor of a cup of joe would overpower anything it went with right? Wrong! Apparently, mango and milky coffee really compliment each other! I strongly recommend giving this a try. It's almost like a coffee boba with fruit chunks instead of tapioca... I know it sounds weird! Try it anyway! I did and I am a changed man."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,I got the osmanthus iced latte and loved it! They used sweetened osmanthus syrup with dried osmanthus flowers which went really well with the coffee. Definitely a unique iced latte and did the 桂花 flavour justice 😇 …
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Had the Durian latte with oat milk.   Very tasty.  I got it with lite ice.  If you let it sit for 30 minutes, it tastes much better.  The durian flavor to me is much more rich tasting."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,This place is amazing! The place is clean and small. It only have a loveseat inside so is definitely not a place to stay at but you can get your drink and walk around the area. The service was great.You can choose how strong you want your coffee and the kind of fruit that you want.In addition they offer regular latte in case you don't like the other drinks. I ordered the banana latte which was great and my friends were brave and order the mango and pineapple. They were amazed by the drink. Not too sweet and not to acid. I will be coming back to try the mango latte.  P.S: They work with too good to go(in case you want to check that out)
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Stopped by to check this place out and it the verdict is still out but for now I rate this place just ok as there were elements that worked but overall execution wasn't where it was needed.  Service was kind and quick. I enjoyed the little waiting area with the sofa that had a beetles throw and a Keith haring neon light.  I ordered a banana latte and it came with real fruit. Where it lacked was the ice machine seemed to have issues so while I got the gist of what they were offering nit having the whole package right away sucked. Still it was tasty and I ended up waiting to get home to add my own ice. Tasted the pineapple and after you really mix it the fruit blends surprisingly well into the latte.  Welp, here's to a hopeful next time maybe"
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Finally having a fruit-latte store in town! I've been waiting for it so long! I love their Durian-latte, so fresh and balance well with oat milk and one shot latte. The mango is my fav too, bit sweet than durian. The interior design is so cool and modern looking to match with the brand."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Eventually, I’ve tried this new concept drinks! When I heard about this shop in the first time! I feel like it’s kinda weird,how come a coffee come with fruits? Are you kidding me!  But when I take the first sip! It’s absolutely good! I got one of the durian latte and a avocado latte! Because I am a big fan of durian, any kind of durian’s drink , I must try! So normally the durian is okay with milk! I have no idea why it  go with coffee is so matched!  Actually, the avocado latte is super popular in HongKong since a year ago, but now I don’t have to go back to HK, I could try it , pretty much like it!  Highly recommend!"
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"I’ve had a few of the flavors and they are definitely different! It’s like a latte except not like traditional ones, these have fresh fruit at the bottom which helps with the creaminess of it. I’ve had the durian, banana and dragonfruit ones and they are pretty to look at d well. You have to make sure to mix well so that you get a little bit of everything in each sip and it tastes pretty good. My least favorite has been the dragonfruit because it adds the least flavor though it looks pretty"
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,I couldn't wrap my head around the concept of having fruit in my coffee but it was surprisingly good. I tried the dragon fruit latte and the fruit made the coffee just sweet enough where it wasn't overbearing.
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"I was worried that it’ll be too sweet or they use cheap jam/can fruit, but nope, it’s real fruit and quality taste! Everything was spot on. We ordered durian and mango, and we loved both so much. I finished my durian one in about 3 mins because it’s so delicious and I couldn’t stop… I’ll probably order 2 drinks next time haha. Besides the taste, I also love how simple their menu is. Just choose fruit, ice, and shots, and done. Also their deco brings you right to the tropical. I live in Hayes Valley which is about 15 minutes drive away, but I can definitely see myself driving to Sunset just for this drink. Can’t wait to try more."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,Durian latte! Got the strong strength. Flavor was good. Wish the durian was more creamy. Pieces I had were a little stringy and not as sweet. Gonna go back try the other flavors.
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,I got their mango latte which I really liked! Will come back to try the other flavors! :)
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Truly had no idea what to expect but this was so good. The fruit (mango, avocado) was so fresh and the espresso was delicious. The person working the cashier was very friendly and patient in explaining the menu and how best to try the drinks."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"I'm a very classic coffee drinker, I just like basic fresh brew coffee and milk but ""Not Latte"" is surprise me with all how well they pair fruit and coffee, a plus for a coffee bean they chose as well. My favorite  drink here is a coconut coffee (I think I addict with it now) and durian coffee. Extremely recommend coffee spot in the Bay!"
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Delicious! Never had fruit in a latte before but it works great. Had the mango and the pineapple. Both were iced. Nice early afternoon pick me up on a warm, sunny day."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Very interesting concept of espresso and fruit! Mango puree was fresh and sweet. Surprisingly refreshing, definitely will swing by to try the other flavor options!"
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,Very unique drink. Got the banana one. Don't drink it without the straw because then you won't be able to get to the banana at the bottom. Decent pricing.
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Ordered the pineapple one, there were some pineapple puree at the bottom, the coffee was a bit sour. I didn't like it. I think the coffee taste doesn't match with the fruit."
Not Latte,2142 Irving St,"Fabulous, amazing drinks. I never seen the latte like this before. Juice mixed latte. Fantastic drink!"
