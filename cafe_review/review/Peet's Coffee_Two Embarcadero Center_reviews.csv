Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"I LOVE this location. Its always busy, so take advantage if you see a short line! The coffee is extremely creamy and fresh. Very pure flavor and I love their creamer. Really great Nitro/Cold Brew style. I really wish they had the Pete's Coffee bottled option at the Walgreens Sacramento Street across the street for convenience or if there was a long line. Even when there is a long line I always wait for this location. Very classy and upscale, also quick service! Really special location. I LOVE SACRAMENTO STREET, SF!!!!🥰🥰🥰"
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"I really like the staff here, but Peet’s in general is going down hill. The coffees I’ve ordered in the last couple months are just not good, and the app sucks more than I can say. It’s an incredibly convenient location but it’s just a better experience for me to go out of my way to go somewhere else."
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,I like the hours. I usually get a matcha latte or a tea. The coffee and tea from Peet's is usually good and doesn't disappoint. Free reliable wifi and a nice place to relax and get work done. Seating is limited but I manage to find a seat every time I've visit.
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,it's good and one time I forgot to tell them to make my drink iced when there was like 2 options iced or warm and they made it for me warm but I told them about it and they were ok with making me a new one
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,Open on Saturday.  Coffee was very hot/ fresh on a cold SF day.  The clerk was very sweet and helpful.  With the holidays I wanted something different.  The special blend was delicious.  If in the area I def would go back again.
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,This peet's is the only one that doesn't over cook my breakfast sandwich
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"I received less than desirable service at the location on 1st and Howard in SF. The barista took my order then left me hanging; yet, took other people's orders behind me and gave them there items right away. Then, when everyone was gone, he started working on my order. Idk, I don't like raising the card but everyone else in line didn't look like me, had coffee orders more complex than mine and he was overly attentive to their needs while ignoring mine; but after everyone left, I still had to remind him that I had ordered an Americano. At that point he apologized and started working on my order approximately 10 minutes after I put my order in. It's cool, I won't return to Peets .. there are other places to go to get coffee where I don't feel marginalized as a customer."
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"Love Peet's coffee. I prefer to frequent small locally run coffee houses, but Peet's is my go to chain coffee house. Many Peet's locations are now offering oat milk too! Yay!"
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"Fast service, just wish they had a good selection of pastries and wish they would be open on Sundays. There seem to be no other open Peet's near the Rincon Hill area."
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,I have small cup of red-labeled Kenya blend there. The taste is so great. It reminds espresso. I would recommend this or green-labeled organic one
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"Great coffee, yet no rest room, no Wifi, not a ideal place for productivity.  But friendly passionate staff for sure!"
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"Better tasting than most big chains like Starbucks or coffeebean/tealeaf. With that said though, the big coffee chains have standard but unextraordinary coffee."
Peet's Coffee,Two Embarcadero Center,"I was desperate to get a Peet's coffee last time, until I passed by the other day in the morning and WOW I ordered a soy late extra of coffee.... WOW 🤩 delicious 🤤 …"
