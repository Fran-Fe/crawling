Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"The pastries are a hit or miss. I was excited to try their eclair, but it tasted stale. Their other pastries like the pistachio date thing and the baklava were better, definitely worth trying. Coffee tastes great. Looking forward to trying their milk tea. I wish they'd do a better job of cleaning the tables, though. Even tho the cafe wasn't too busy, some tables were left uncleaned, so I had to wipe it myself."
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"This is a new ethnic cafe transporting one to Arabia with their aromatic tea, coffee, and pastries!! Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is excellent. You can find a seat at the back and have a nice corner to yourself and stare out the street, or you can sit outside.  I had the Adeni Chai made with hot evaporated milk (they insisted this is the only milk that works not soy milk or others 😀!) Yummy!"
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Definitely interesting and difference, compared to other brand coffee. This place serves authentic Yemen, which is very very unique and fascinating. However, I can’t get use to the complex taste from the way their brew coffee (boiling large chunks), and from spices (lots of them, you can’t image the variety). That said, not for me doesn’t mean this is not good. Four start just for its existence."
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,Great to have this open in my neighborhood! Snagged an excellent cortado before their official opening and have since tried a couple of pastries and more coffee. They have coffee with cardamom which I love and is very hard to find in SF!
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Wow! Gorgeous new Yemeni cafe. The coffee with cardamom is heavenly, and all of the pastries have been delicious. The folks who work here are really lovely as well.  Such a treat to go into the office now knowing I can have my coffee break here. Wonderful addition to the neighborhood."
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Amazing cafe and atmosphere.  The coffee and tea are great as well. They can do better with the desserts, but i love this place and highly recommend it.."
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"The tea and desserts were incredibly authentic and exquisitely delicious. The ambiance was delightful, creating a truly enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this place."
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,One of the best and delicious lattes I have ever tasted.  The place is very welcoming and there is so much history for Yemeni coffee shown throughout store ☕️

Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,Incredible drinks and food at Sana’s cafe. HOMEMADE YEMENI SOUL FOOD. The homemade honey bread dipped in the Adeni Chai is a bucket list item. Beautiful interior as well.
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Wow delicious! Im a big fan of Turkish coffee and the Mowfusa (?) was amazing. The coffee was excellently brewed, powerful with some texture but not too thick or gritty, paired with cardamom and cream… even better (and bigger) than Turkish coffee!"
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Came here multiple times for Adeni Chai. I highly recommend getting a pot and sitting in the back!  For baked goods, check out their Bassbosa. Super nice sweet almond spongy cake."

Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Fantastic coffee and tea! I've really missed Arabic coffee and tea since my trip to Jordan and this place is perfect (cardamom belongs in coffee!). There's tons of good pastries too. I saw the sign while I was walking to work and I'm so glad I stopped in. I ended up stopping by on the way back from work too for more. Highlight of my day, the only reason I'll go to the office in the future. Thank you!"
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"The interior is beautiful, and the staff are super friendly and attentive. I don’t drink coffee but I do enjoy their tea, as well as the variety of delicious and interesting desserts. It’s a nice place to relax for a bit, or grab a treat on the way home."
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,Cute little cafe with friendly staff. We tried the coffee cake and Qisher. The cake was excellent. The Qisher felt watered down.
Sana’a cafe,199 New Montgomery St,"Awesome new coffee shop. Many of my favorite coffee shops in this area closed during the pandemic. This place is a gem. The staff are super welcoming, the coffee my friend got and Yemeni tea I got were very good, and while I didn’t try the pastries, they looked very very tempting. This is definitely my new meeting spot when I come to SF (they have a lot of seating too)."
