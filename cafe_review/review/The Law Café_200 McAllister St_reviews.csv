The Law Café,200 McAllister St,The Law Cafe's staff are super friendly and welcoming. Their food is incredibly delicious and their prices are unbeatable. I'd be willing to travel across the state just to have their famous chocolate chip cookies again. Hastings is lucky to have them!
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,"Wonderful establishment nestled away in the University of California Hastings. They offer a great arrangement of warm and cold food, snacks, sweets and more! The staff is super friendly and the place is always clean and really affordable! I highly recommend."
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,"A great place with a variety of food and drinks at reasonable prices. However, you need access to the college campus (currently a photo ID/student ID) to access the café. Closed during summer/winter break."
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,Great spot for a quick snack at a reasonable price. I live nearby and don't attend the school but visitors can grab a quick bite after checking in at the security desk. The upstairs foyer is quite scenic if not due for a cosmetic update.
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,"Inexpensive, fast and friendly. This place offers a great variety of breakfast to lunch options! It's open to the public so don't be scared to go inside the law school!"
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,So good!! I love the wraps here. They put amazing aoli’s in them and they are huge for a pretty low cost. Also a big fan of the pre-packed meals. There’s a Mediterranean pack with dolmas and hummus that’s amazing.
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,"Soups are great. The hours listed are incorrect, though, it's open until 4 PM M-Th and until 3 PM on F."
The Law Café,200 McAllister St,Great place but be aware that this is not a public space. It's only for UC Law students and other businesses professionals. I couldn't get in. I would've loved to try the coffee 😄 …
