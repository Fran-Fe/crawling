Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,Nice coffee shop to hang out with friends. I’m addicted to their brown sugar matcha oat latte.
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"Peet's on Market & 2nd Street is a long time favorite for me. The interior is dark, roomy, and always clean. The exterior seating is also comfortable and protected by a patio. The customer service staff are always friendly and polite. My favorite item is the chicken chorizo."

Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"Absolutely love this location, its always consistent from the friendly welcoming service to the cleanliness of the store."
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"The coffee is typical Peets--roasted to death--but within the context of an oat milk latte, it is very drinkable.  I like the outdoor seating (will be better once the Market street construction is completed), and the service is pretty topnotch."

Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,Usual peers goodness but this space is not very efficient.counter takes up most of the space leading to few seats for customers.

Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,The coffee is OK but not good. And the advertised wifi is not working
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,My favorite coffee shop. In dire need of a remodel.
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"The service there is really nice and efficient. Even if the line is super long, they get things out pretty quick. Their coffee is really good (way better than Starbucks') and their almond milk is much sweeter and doesn't taste bitter like most. If you haven't tried it yet, go for their Earl Grey Latte (I recommend with almond milk). Also, the staff is pretty attentive. I order a drink with almond milk that usually comes with whipped cream (I didn't know that) and I didn't ask for no whipped cream. The barista noticed it was being made with almond milk and nothing was marked about the whipped cream so he asked ""Hey, do you still want whipped cream"" and didn't just assume I wanted it. That personal touch was really nice. I like Peet's a lot."
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"Good coffee and snacks selection, Good location right new MINI station. Good place to get a coffee or snacks."

Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,A good place for a cup of coffee!
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"2 bucks for a coffee, you can't really beat that.  The proximity to my apartment building alone is worth the 2 bucks.  The coffee is pretty standard.  Like I have heard before from coffee enthusiasts, that at a major chain coffee house you are paying for caffeine not necessarily a quality of the coffee.  Which I tend to agree with, but sometimes you want to get something fast and relatively cheap that's going to wake you up, hence why I went to Peet's.  Over all not bad and they are everywhere in the city so access is the best part of this coffee place."
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,The make it right every time. Excellent service. Very clean.
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,love getting free coffee with my pound of coffee
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,Great place for coffee dates as you can bring your drinks (and free WIFi code) into the glass-covered courtyard next door. Peet's Coffee is exemplary and you can easily dial into the WiFi. Impress a business or personal date with your choice of meeting location!
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,Great dark chocolate orange latte
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,Nice Peets next to a public open space.
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"I used to love Peet's Coffee because I'm all about that strong, bitter jolt in the morning; Peet's really provided that for me. But after years of corporate provided free Peet's coffee, I started to become sensitive to the bitterness of the brew.  Overall, I think the coffee is good once in a while, maybe every other day, but having it as a daily coffee grind could potentially set you up to feel all coffee's are quite mild."
Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,"This was not my first time visiting this Peets location, but this will certainly be my last. My experience here was nothing short of awful. I ordered coffee and did some work for a whole hour there. I meets some friends, talk for a moment and then get up. I was going to shoot some photography of the coffee shop and he burista's making coffee (but generally the overview of coffee shop atmosphere. It was simply for a project. Then one of the women managers there tells me that I can't take pictures in there and I have to delete them, I refuse and tell her that I don't believe a word she saying, when she said that's are policy here. So she told me I had to leave. I've come there many times and I've never been treated I a rude manner, but after this, I believe that woman should be fired. She's not fit to run a good coffee shop, regardless of the fact she was a lesbian. Peets coffee is no where near as good as Blue Bottle Coffee anywhere, plus I can take pictures over there."

Peet's Coffee,595 Market St Suite 143,Peet's is one of the Best Coffe Shops Out Here In San Francisco. I have to give to them they make a mean Tripple white mocha  im drowling thinking about it.
