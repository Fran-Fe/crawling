Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Very cute and clean cafe. Fast service! Most importantly: amazing food and great coffee. I recommend the almond Danish, the best I've had in a long time. I also like that they do little hearts on the coffers very cute."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,This is my favorite spot in the city to grab coffe or wonderful snacks. They have fresh delicious empanadas and pastries. Staff is always welcoming and the atmosphere is calm. It’s a great space to do remote work or read. They have outdoor and indoor sititing. I will keep coming back.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Really liked this place. Visiting from Sydney and regard this place as having the best coffee we had all trip. Made with care, seems like a business that wants to give the customer a good experience. Bottom line - awesome coffee, and not part of any big chain which I liked. And great soundtrack!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Best latte I’ve had in a very long time. I like how they focused more on the coffee and not masking the notes with flavored add ins. Highly recommend.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Cafe Bodega is an amazing father/son owned and ran business in Downtown SF. The coffee is fresh, flavorful, and made to order (pour overs). The Carlos were welcoming and really educated me on the origins and thesis of their coffee beans harvesting and production. Brought a few colleagues today to try and they felt equally happy. This location is a great to work from or meet up. Cant' wait for the next shop to open."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Great coffee and great people.  I stumbled upon this shop when it was on Fillmore and would drop in on my way to work. The cappuccino is as I like it and far better and leas expensive than the $8 ones being offered in North Beach. Since they moved, I try to make the trek down to California Street to enjoy the great coffee and the great conversation when it is not too busy. It is worth the walk, it is worth the wait if any. Check it out! Got the Honey Cinnamon Latte this time. Tasty."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Saw this cute coffee shop on the way to getting my nails done in FiDi and had to stop by afterwards.  The employees there were really friendly and I definitely sensed a passion for their craft.  My oat milk cappucino was great :).  Great internal seating inside and it was a good vibe inside.  Good for mid-day meetings if you work in the FiDi area, or if you're simply in the area running errands or visiting.  It's a nice tucked away place to grab a coffee and a bite.  Excited that this location is in the neighborhood!  Can't wait to try their drip coffee and their other coffee items on the menu."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Very unpleasant experience. Brought a dog on leash, upfront ordering the owner told me it’s a farm to table so dog not allowed, I said I will dine outside, he says “ok make it quick”, in a very unpleasant way. He rushed the ordering process and very unkind. Later he came out to explained the situation, but he just explained for himself, not sincere at all. Felt like not welcomed at all, and they are not kind. I went there because I read all the good reviews and thought it was a must go coffee shop in town. Honestly after the whole experience I can’t even remember how the coffee taste, being respected is more important than flavor."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Coffee Bodega was my favourite boutique coffee shop in downtown San Francisco.  The quality of the coffee and its preparation were outstanding.  I had the chance to talk to the owner, who is a person with a great passion for people having an excellent coffee experience.  Thus, his dedication and attention to detail have converted this unique place into an incomparable Costa Rican theme coffee shop worth often visiting for a break or to close a business. The pour-over La Pastora Tarrazú was exquisite!  Also, it is conveniently located a few steps from Market St, Embarcadero, and one of the cable - car stations."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"For people that love pure, excellent, refined coffee this is the best in SF! Additionally the inside of the space is beautiful, in a prime location, with a very passionate and friendly staff. Strongly recommend the iced latte with oat milk 🤙🏽 …"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Fantastic father/son ownership duo. Kind and professional. Not to mention the coffee is top notch. I love the cinnamon latte but can’t go wrong with any of their espresso drinks.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Really nice place. I'd find myself coming here for a cup of coffee while waiting for my partner to get out from work at Starbucks. I enjoy the coffee here. I would recommend to those who are looking for a new spot to relax, and have a cup of coffee that aren't from a chain"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"This has to be my favorite coffee shop in SF! Not only is the coffee amazing, but it’s a great, relaxing space that’s conveniently located downtown. Carlos is always welcoming and since it’s a family run business, you can tell they care about their quality and their customers’ experience in the shop. It’s truly a gem!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Great coffee and friendly owners. I’ve been coming here for almost a year now and have no complaints. Really enjoy the experience. Super cozy and must try if you like specialty coffee
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"On July 15, 2022, I visited a new Coffee Cafe at 1 California called ""Bodega Farm-to Table"". This Cafe is located in the former Peet's coffee location at Embarcadero & Drumm. Since I was in transit, I simply ordered a house coffee. In the short time at the Cafe, I immediately realized the kaleidoscope of special features such as the coffee, ambience and service. I give the Cafe and Coffee 5 stars. The coffee was smooth, clean tasting, with hints of chocolate. I was not able to sit and enjoy the ambience. But standing inside, I felt comfortable because of the lighting and dark wood interior design. The Cafe offers pastries and empanadas which I will try next time. The customer service person was laid back and chilled so this also felt comfortable. If you are in the area of Embarcadero/Drumm/Market Street, please treat yourself. July 25, 2022, I finally returned to try the Vegetarian Empanadas. Small but powerful. Cheesy, Greens (Spinach), Bell pepper. Yummy (lecker) In German!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Coffee was very weak for me personally. I had the reserve pour over. The pastry was super soft and seems like a left over from the weekend. For the price it's a major disappointment after seeing the rating.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Wonderful customer service Deicious coffee, teas, pasteies and empanadas. Classy decor and a peaceful atmosphere to relax with a book o in good company.  Glad to have Coffee Bodega in my radar!  New opening soon in downtown San Francisco!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,What a great family owned place.  They use Costa Rica coffee only.  And honestly that was never on my radar.  Well it is now.   What great coffee. And super nice people.  Please check them out.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,I wanted to like this place. But chai tea latte was so bland. Paid $7 and I can barely taste the spices. Also the owner and worker were not friendly. I paid for the drink and he just stood there and didn’t say thank you or anything. It was more like he was annoyed by my presence. I misunderstood that they were closing at 1 when I came in. they could have said they were closed if they didn’t want to serve anymore.I would completely understand. But service can definitely be better.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,On a cross country trip with my mom we stopped at this lovely little jewel! We love coffee and was very pleased with this choice. The coffee was fresh and tasted amazing. It balanced out wonderfully with the Apple turnover! Carlos was wonderful!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,The man wouldn't accept my cash tip for whatever reason. Didn't speak to me or even offer me any cream but the customer after me was treated very well and he even asked how her day was going. I felt very unwelcome and i think he wanted me to know it. Great coffee but i went to see my therapist after.  And I'm just wondering whats the point of street signs when not everyone is welcome.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Went for a walk around SF and stopped at this cute coffee spot. The coffee was amazing and we were so excited about our cheese danish we forgot to take a picture. I highly recommend stopping by if you’re ever in SF!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Had a very unwarranted and intense interaction with a gentlemen here regarding my dog. Upon arriving, he immediately points at my dog if it’s a service animal and I answered yes. He shared that it’s different than a ESA and I answered that yes I understand the laws and that he is a service animal and I can show proof. He says no that’s okay but I felt like he kept looking at how the dog and I looked and bombarded me with more questioning when I got up to pay which was just bad vibes. I told him, look if you want to deny me service or cause such an unwarranted interaction, I can just leave. He kept saying no he “isn’t” denying me service but his actions and behavior didn’t showcase that. I told him, I’m not here to cause trouble, I am abiding to the laws, and there are hundreds of coffee shops here and I honestly don’t need this type of interrogation or have the time to argue for $4 coffee (lol). Such a rude and unpleasant experience. Will not be returning."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,My favorite place to get coffee downtown - Carlos is fantastic and the coffee is delicious! Highly recommend.

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Excellent coffee roasted in Costa Rica. It's the kind of Cafe you want to support. Sustainable, working with small farms, small business.  Walk up to the kiosk and order your drink. They have oats milk option. Definitely get my coffee here from now on when in Cow Hollow Marina district."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Really good quality pourover and the empanadas were great too. Really reminiscent of empanadas salteñas. Will be back!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Service was good, coffee was fine, but the blueberry muffin looked and tasted like the ones from Costco"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Awesome local coffeeshop with outdoor seating and a takeout window. The latte I ordered was one of the bests in San Francisco-so smooth and fragrant. The owner Carlos was very friendly and I’d definitely come back for the great coffee and hospitality.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Quiet place where I was able to chat with a friend for a couple of hours without feeling rushed. Good coffee and food, conveniently located."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"My favorite local coffee spot. Unbeatable service from Carlos, he always gets my order right. Perfect location to just walk up and get a quick cuppa. Couldn’t recommend it enough!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,One of the best espresso-based coffees in the city. Smooth and great depth of flavor. 10/10 would return even though it's a trek from the Dogpatch! Carlos the owner is also a really friendly guy who clearly cares deeply about sourcing and making quality coffee.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,The Reservation Especial is probably one of the best coffee roasts I’ve had in a long time 👍
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Worst coffee on this planet. The $4,50 espresso shot tasted sour as vinegar twice. Arrogant ignorant scruffy staff."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"The coffee was extremely smooth. The owners are a father/son duo, and are friendly, knowledgable, and clearly care about the community. Overall amazing service and coffee. We will be back again!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Just went here this morning on vacation from Kansas City. Honestly couldn’t find an open Starbucks crazy but very lucky because I found this place. BEST COFFEE EVER!! Way better than Starbucks. Staff was friendly. This will definitely be my go to coffee place in San Fran! Thank you
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,This place is the best for coffee..strong and darn good.  And they know how to make a flat white.  The father and son owners are always friendly...the way family business was at one time in San Francisco.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,The food and coffee are wonderful here. It's cozy and inviting. A highlight of my visit to San Francisco!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"I never understood why people were such snobs about coffee until I had a cup made by Carlos. I lived near a couple other spots but after I discovered Coffee Bodega, I never went anywhere else!  After one visit, Carlos remembered my order and was always so thoughtful with each customer.  Hands down the best coffee I’ve ever had— i still think about it even though I moved out of the city a couple months ago.  Definitely check it out ☕️"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Terrific Coffee Carlos is a great barista and was able to give us exactly what we wanted.  The beans are super quality but it’s expensive – nicey but pricey!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Loved this little coffee pop up in the window of Jaxson! The owner was so nice and knowledgeable. And most importantly, the coffee was delicious! I had a cappuccino with oatmilk. We’ll be back soon!"

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Tell my friend Carlos I say hi. This place may have got the best coffee in the U.S. Here, the espresso is well rounded, never too acidic. milk is never too hot, perfect amount of foam. Always quick and delicious. skip the line at equator and ditch the wait for wreckingball. Put your phone down and go here."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Amazing cold brew👍🏻 Definitely they are using high and good quality coffee beans! :) …
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"This is a true coffee lover's  coffee shop! Had a great experience in here, and will definitely be back when im in the area!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"This place makes the BEST cup of coffee! So rich and smooth. I found it through a recommendation on NextDoor... and they did not steer me wrong! It's always a special treat. They use coffees grown, roasted and packed by small farmer cooperatives in Costa Rica. The owner Carlos is really nice too. I highly recommend it!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"jody and i were so lucky to stumble across this temple to coffee on our way to the ferry building market. such a delightful experience to meet carlos and his son and experience their passion for great coffee and the people who come into their bodega to drink it. this is what i've always loved the most about san francisco--the artisans who have devoted years to something they care about and perfected it for the delight of everyone else. the care (and careful experimentation) that went into this delicious slightly chocolatey pour-over brew was such a pleasure to discuss and taste. the time it took to make was perfect for a discussion of why the beans don't need to be a week old or less--the cultivation and quality being so much more important. also delicious pastries, indoor and outdoor seating, and the happy contentment of not going food shopping hungry."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Coffee is delicious. They also didn’t charge me for almond milk, which was nice!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Love this place. The service is superb - Carlos is super friendly. It's run by a local father/son duo that opened right before the pandemic. Coffee is Costa Rican, which isn't my first choice (I prefer darker roasts), but it's certainly drinkable and one of the less expensive cups you'll find in SF. They have free WiFi and an outdoor seating area, great for popping up and taking a quick call or two. Definitely drop by if you're in the Cow Hollow/Marina area!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Country bar by night and coffee shop by day. The cold brew is strong and flavorful and the iced lattes are incredible! There’s also some cute outdoor seating and pastries if you need a snack. Gotta check this place out!
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Beautiful Coffee, even decaf americano will blow your mind!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Didn’t know what to expect, just looking for coffee and a little breakfast. Carlos kindly asks us what specifically we are looking for in a drink and describes how he can make it so. And he definitely did. I thought this little place wouldn’t have been the best of what I was looking for this morning, but I was quickly proven wrong.  Don’t underestimate this place and the kindness of these people and the lengths they will go to, to fulfill what you are hoping for. The pastries are shockingly very good!!  But overall it was the heart of Carlos and his father that are beautiful. This was more enjoyable than any food or drink. Also seeing the creative work they have been putting into this little cafe is outstanding and worth seeing and chatting with them about.  Come give blessings to these amazing folk and their hard work as they care for their customers and many of the homeless around the area.  Speaking bountiful blessings with Holy Spirit over this place! Thank you Father for them!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Great coffee, authentic, beats any chain"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Not friendly staff, poor quality coffee and food, very uncomfortable experience."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Just had my first experience at Coffee Bodega-ordered a pour over and it is amazing!

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Great cozy cafe with a fantastic barista. They pull excellent shots here. Definitely the best cappuccino I’ve had in the Bay Area.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Came here a couple times during my visit. My family and partner seemed to enjoy the drinks. The lemon poppy seed muffin was incredible. It was so light and not dry at all. Also, I had a Topo Chico water from somewhere else that I thought had a twist cap but actually had a pop cap and I wasn't exactly carrying around a bottle opener and the man at this place was nice enough to open it for me!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Their Reserva pour over is to die for!  Easily best I've had.  Pastries are good if hungry.  But I come back for the coffee
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,Great spot serving single origin coffee. This place should be on every coffee affectionados list. Some of the best espresso in San Francisco.
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"I searched for coffee in my neighborhood during a short stay in town and went with the highest rated one. But they were closed on Monday, so I settled for tried and true Peet’s nearby. Went back to Peet’s next day and walking home, realized this place was open. Returned to my hotel and for whatever reason I dropped off my latte and went back to Bodega. Maybe because it’s where I originally planned to go? But I justified buying a new coffee by wanting to support small businesses. Their latte was delicious, smooth, and one of the best I’ve had. Savored it and then bought some beans to bring home. The owner was unusually down to earth and enjoyable to talk to.  I’m so glad it worked out that I tried their coffee. I guarantee, I’ll never again visit SF without stopping by Coffee Bodega💕"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Absolutely the best Cortado I've had in San Francisco. Maybe even ever. Carlos, one of the baristas here, is very friendly, and excels at his craft"

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"This place is a gem and Carlos, who runs it, is an absolute gent. He had the courage to open this coffee shop in the middle of Covid and built a beautiful little wooden patio, perfect for sipping your coffee and reading a book or having a convo. Coffee's top notch. Pastries delicious. Check it out!"
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Tried the mocca, it tasted good and of high quality. The inside is also very nice, it has a clean and sleek atmosphere (I personally love the plants on the wall)."
Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Great service & coffee, and the best empanadas."

Coffee Bodega Farm-to-Table,1 California St,"Their espresso is AMAZING! I'm Costa Rican and have worked at multiple well known cafes, such as Peets, Blue Bottle, and Four Barrel. This guy knows what he's doing and you can taste the difference. The hand made wooden fixtures and classic Costa Rican Ox cart out front just add the already charming aesthetic. You're missing out on some delicious coffee and warm customer service if you don't check out this quaint coffee shop in the heart of the Marina."
