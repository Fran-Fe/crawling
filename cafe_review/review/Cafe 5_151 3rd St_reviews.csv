Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"We went there on New Year's Eve when it poured outside (2022). We had no choice but to have lunch here but the food was pretty good. Food comes out quickly, how they operate is pretty efficient, and the vibe is great. Wish it didn't rain so that we could enjoy outside as well."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Nice cafe with great a great vibe. Surprisingly good for a museum cafe, we enjoyed the experience! We only had Americano’s and the coffee cake. The coffee cake was ok, a bit dry and tasted more like a citrus cake. Wont order that again, but the other food looked good that came out of the kitchend."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,We arrived and one of us went up to order at the counter and the other found a free table and they scolded us for not following their seating system. But the system isn’t written anywhere and we weren’t informed when we walked in. We saw others walk in an have the same unpleasant experience. Otherwise the coffee is pretty good and the strawberry sponge is tasty.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"The rooftop setting is definitely nice, the food is surprisingly great for a museum so keep it up in the kitchen and they only loose a star because of the attitude at the cashier."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Pretty Café with really nice outdoor seating. We got the Oolong perfume caramel aubeurresale tea & an oat milk latte. Cafe is located on the 5th floor. Took a few minutes to find.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Absolutely awful chicken wings, solid as a brick, small plates, so your food is always on the table not on the plate. And the price was too high for “that” misunderstanding. Unpleasant lady who rudely told me not to seat at the table until I make order but I was already waiting for a husband who was making an order. Highly not recommended"
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Shockingly good for a museum cafe, with truly California touches like hot-smoked steelhead trout salad topped with German potato salad, served on plates that remind me of the Tartine Manufactory. Pastries such as the excellent croissant are from Craftsman and Wolves, an excellent local bakery. There's a view of an outdoor sculpture garden and the hard-to-see undulating white backside of the new building that you can't spot from the street."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Nice lunch at a reasonable price, out in the sunshine on the balcony with views of sculpture. Service was friendly and quick. Table service was friendly and efficient. It was just what I wanted, and a meal and drink (chicken sandwich and ice tea) at a nice cafe all for under $25. Will return."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,absolutely loved it!! great food and great service! 6/5 stars
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"It was a nice respite after spending several hours exploring this large museum. Probably best to order from the prepared bagels and sandwiches for best value. We had a nice quinoa salad with beets, orange tomatoes, broccoli and pistachios and a factory salad with asparagus, olives, mushrooms, cheese wedges, and bread sticks. Everything was beautifully presented and quite good. The coffee was good too."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Great open ambiance with indoor and outdoor sitting area connected through huge wall of glasses. A good mid-way stop on the fifth floor to get some rest, get some quality time with your friends and chill-out in general. The menu is decent too and the coffee is good enough. Go for Americano rather than just coffee if you want something stronger. They also provide water and plastic cups for free and don't mind you using the place as a rest stop even if you don't buy anything. A great touch."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"How hard is it to make a cup of tea?! It's just hot water and a tea bag. However, heating water to anywhere near boiling is evidently too difficult a task here. My first pot ($4 for about 16oz water and 1 tea bag) was barely warm, yet I was so desperate for some tea I drank it anyway and optimistically ordered another one, which was even worse. The water was so tepid the tea barely even brewed. At least they have soy milk and honey.  The vegetable cassoulet was tasty but quite small. Good cheesecake. Extra stars for ambiance. Terrible service."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,We drank some coffee and ate some sweets. The baked goods were of great quality. Service was great too.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"We got the Vegan vegetable lentil salad, the chicken croquettes, and a raspberry donut. The salad and donut were delicious but the croquettes were small and not worth the price. If you’re coming here now, get the pork special over the croquettes."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Would be a nice place if u are local or know their protocol. Otherwise they can be rude. Hubby lined up to order food and I took a seat at a vacant table. Was told off for not observing their protocol which is not written on the table or explained when we entered the cafe. Am fr Singapore and speaking English the whole time but a waitress asked if I speak Chinese. Maybe I need to apologise for my accent too. Probably won’t get to visit again anyway but will remember this place for sure.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Visiting the SFMOMA is enough of a treat by itself, but being able to dine inside on high quality food only makes it better. Cafe 5 offers both inside and outside eating with a full lunch menu, pastries and assortment of drinks. Prices are roughly $15 dollars for most lunch dishes and 6 for pastries. Staff seems to be a bit aloof which can be good if you don't mind waiting around, otherwise it might be annoying."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Big recommend😋食物新鮮美味，健康有機的料理。fresh, delicious, healthy and organic. …"
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,No vegan food options. Not acceptable in a setting that should cater to all museum-goers.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Feisty counter person served up tons of attitude. The lunch, however, was amazing. Overshadowing the poor performance of the counter person."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,The open space with lots of light make's it a very enjoyable place. Great place to have a coffee break while touring Moma. But the food is a little better than airport food.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Excellent food, excellent coffee, excellent system. Lovely views! Good place to sit, eat and stay. Staff is very kind and intuitive."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Loved the pea soup and cheddar quiche.  Beautiful patio
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Very enjoyable and luminous rooftop restaurant with tasty California food. This is certainly not run-of-the-mill museum food.
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Lovely space, hosts were really nice, 3 stars though because waitress had attitude."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Great coffee!
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Quality and interesting food in a light-filled space, reasonably priced for a nice cafe."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Would be a great place, if they knew how to operate an espresso machine."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"Nice space, with fairly priced drinks"
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Very enjoyable and luminous rooftop restaurant with tasty California food :)
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Food was good... service was the worst... cashier/wait staff... had to go ask for my food at the cashier
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,Nice place to take a break in
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"You can have tea on the large outside terrace or inside. You can also enjoy the subtle appearance of the museum. Cakes are expensive, but delicious."
Cafe 5,151 3rd St,"There are a bit of people, but the staff are friendly and the taste is good."
