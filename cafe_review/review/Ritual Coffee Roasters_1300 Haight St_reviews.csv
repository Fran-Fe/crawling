Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Ritual is a local coffee shop with 3 locations in San Francisco. This is the Haight Street location and is located at the top part of the shopping district, next to a residential area.  Ritual roasts their own coffee beans and had several varieties available to purchase, as well as a small selection of branded t-shirts, nice drinkware, and coffee making supplies.  The interior is minimalist, with 4-5 tables lining the windows and bench seating in the bay window near the door. It’s a narrow space, so seems like it could feed really crowded rather quickly…  The drink menu had the basics (coffee + tea) plus a limited choice of specialty drinks. I got a latte that tasted like a blueberry muffin, which the barista suggested.(They don’t really have food, just a small selection of pastries to accompany your coffee.)  Overall, it seems like a nice place to meet a friend for coffee in the neighborhood."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great little coffee shop if you’re in the area. It’s kitty corner from Buena Vista Park and right in between Upper and Lower Haight. It can get crowded so I usually try to go odd hours so that I don’t have to wait long. Coffee is great and they have some cool SF merch too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,This is my favorite cafe. The coffee beans have a wonderful aroma. I also like their iced Americano and iced latte.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Man, I've tried to give this place so many chances, thinking that maybe the next time or the next time will be a nice time... But I can take a hint that the employees at this location are just committed to their bad attitudes, and are unable to be kind to customers. Also, a plain espresso is now $4.50?? It hasn't ever been an outright ""bad"" experience, but I never feel better after coming here.  Having been a barista for years and years, I just can't understand why the people at this shop don't take more pride in their role. Maybe it's a management thing, maybe it's just the too-cool-for-you city vibe, but I'll definitely be spending my dollars elsewhere from now on."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Espresso was not good, very burnt aroma and taste. The donut was delicious. Baristas gave nice service."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"The best coffee shop in SF! Make sure you grab a cup, you don’t wanna miss out 😉 …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"One of the best local coffee brands in SF (this is just one of their locations). This coffee is notorious in SF, and used in many local mom and pop cafe's as well because it really is great coffee. Make sure if you're visiting SF to make this a must see. Note: A bit strong and deep flavor if that's your thing."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Sit back and unwind from the bustle of the city with high quality coffee and tasty pastries. Places like these make me appreciate a cup of brewed coffee
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Delicious coffee, kind baristas. Best proper espresso drinks in the neighborhood by far! Also great place to buy beans for home.  Their seasonal specialty drinks are always fun too, if you want to try something new. I still miss the Keke Palmer, a sparkling iced tea lemonade."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Great coffee! A good coffee is more about the after taste rather than aroma or the body itself. I got single origin coffee V60 and it tasted like heaven. Rich in aroma and body with an after taste like you did not wanted to eat or drink anything for couple of hours to have the taste on your tongue. Also a good place to work, in the heart of San Francisco. Coffees price range from $5-$6 but definitely worth it!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,The coffee here lives up to the San Francisco standard and is a great place to hang around while enjoying a latte. Their espresso machine is vintage so definitely check that out or ask the barista about it (if they're not busy).
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,the coffee is delicious and the employees are so cool. I just wish the prices were more affordable:/
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"The best coffee we found in our week in the US (actually, the only good coffee) – just as good as back home in Wellington, New Zealand, or in Melboirne."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,They don't always have it but the carrot ginger cake is so good. Also love the Dandelion mocha
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,I went here with a couple of people. I got a cappuccino. The second person got a regular coffee. The third person didn't get a drink. We also bought a bag of coffee beans. The drinks were good and the customer service was good too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Really good coffee if you’re in the area. Small bites, would be nice if they got a microwave to warm the goods up :). Take a walk around Buena Vista Park while sippin your coffee afterwards!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Popped in for a latte whilst doing some Christmas shopping. Nice fit out, chilled vibes and a lovely latte.  Highly amused by barista lamenting all the latte orders - obviously not challenging his creativity! Was tempted to shout “lattes for all” but wimped it.  Would go back if I was in the part of town."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great hot chocolate. Great for working if you don’t need Wi-Fi or power. Seats were open at their busiest time.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"The coffee is great, but the other drinks like their chai latte taste like nothing."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Love this place. They pay close attention to detail, making sure your drink looks and tastes great while ensuring the temperature is ok too. I appreciate that, because I have buying a coffee and then having you wait for it to cool enough not to burn your mouth. I might be picky, but if you're picky then this is the place for you. You won't be disappointed ☕ 👍"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great coffee ☕!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,I’ve had their sweet 16 blend and loved it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Incredible coffee! The staff was very nice and knowledgeble, and their pourover coffee is fantastic.  Great atmosphere to sit, talk, study, or just for takeout."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"They ask that you show proof of vaccination when you tell them you're dining in.. I had an experienced barista make me a nice crafty latte in a ceramic cup for sitting at one of the few tables. From the limited variety of pastries I chose a chocolate croissant. It all came to under $10. It was busy and full the entire time we sat, though not unpleasant."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"When they opened up I thought “wow the last thing we need in SF is another coffee shop selling small lattes for almost $6”. But then I started giving them a chance because I literally live 3 doors up from them. But after today’s extremely rude and hostile interaction with one of the workers who refused to make my usual drink that they have made many times before I will certainly not go back and will urge my friends and neighbors not to go there either. All I asked for was them using half Almond milk and half Soy milk, as all soy is too much soy, and all almond milk doesn’t froth up at when steamed. It’s a great combination for anyone who doesn’t want a dairy milk latte. Everyone there has been accommodating before for this simple request but today the barista decided “we don’t do that”. To which I replied “really? you have many times before”. She went off not even saying, sorry we can’t do it, it’s against company policy to mix milks or whatever her rationale was, she just kept saying “we don’t do that”. But they do! Anyways she conceded and agreed to make the drink, took my money, made the other drink I ordered for my girlfriend, and then at the last second reverted to saying again “we don’t make that, pick one almond milk or soy milk!” Super offended by her abrasive negative attitude and unfriendliness I got a refund and left. With probably about 10 other cafes within a 4 block radius why would I ever go there again and deal with that kind of negativity and lack of customer service? I went up to Gus’s Market (2 blocks away) and they happily made my half soy half almond milk latte."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"$7 mocha that tasted like water and customer service wasn’t great, but the cafe had good vibes"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Nice spot with tons of natural light. Baristas were great and coffee was insanely delicious (albeit a price tag to match). They had oat milk but no wifi which is tragic because I liked hanging around there. So plan to bring a hotspot if you have work to do; I saw at least one outlet, as well."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great local haunt with amazing artisinal coffee drinks and friendly barristas
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Both their hot latte & iced latte somehow lacked flavor. Yet, I know that Ritual is a known roaster with high-quality beans (I've personally bought their beans before), so I think I just got unlucky with the barista. In my opinion, a shop like this has to do better at their high price point."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Best flat whites in SF and super friendly staff :)
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great coffee but unfriendly staff that treats customers like they have the plague. Unfortunately vibe and mood are as important to me as the coffee.  They removed all of their seating.  Fortunately there are better coffee shops in SF!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Obnoxious experience: the baristas play heavy metal non stop. We tried waiting but gave up
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"I have been here several times, because the coffee is good but the service is very contrasting compared to other coffee shops. For $7 small coffee you get no Hi, no Thank you for the tips, no oat milk in your coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Writing this review on network because they don’t offer WiFi. If you like your froufrou coffee shop extra smug, look no further. Be prepared to show your vax card, or not. It’s Willy nilly."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great mid town Haight Asbury location and service. Good pastries for kids and adults.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Saw the ""best coffee I've ever had in my life review"" so I went. Okay service not great at all coffee, lacked flavor, would not recommend"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"If the barista followed their own suggestion of 17.3g in 32g out in 32sec at 198-200° for the Sweet 16, the espresso I had would have been much better. It was too cold and too acidic for how it should be. I came home and was able to pull a much better shot."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Had takeout, line was long so just got a standard coffee but their standard coffee is really good."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Love this place! Parking is valet only but it's only a short walk from my apartment and there is street parking. They have the best hot almond milk lattes and the best iced vanilla latte I've ever had, it wasn't overly sweet or bitter, perfectly balanced. The food is great too, it tastes fresh and the portions are large. They are super friendly there and have reward stamp cards! The wait is always really short, I get food to go on my lunch breaks and never wait more than ten minutes. One of my favorite coffee stops in ktown!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Good coffee, terrible online order system. After 15 mins of waiting, asked about status and turns out they don’t start preparing online orders until you ask about them. Completely defeats the point of ordering ahead if you still have to stand in line to ask them to make it. Apparently it is to keep the coffee warm, but I am perfectly capable of timing an order to pick up.  If you’re going to be the only coffee shop in the country that doesn’t start preparing an online order immediately, then you should put a big banner on your website and outside so that people know the online ordering system is pointless."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Lovely coffee and a friendly team of baristas ❤️ They always have nice music and chill vibes, perfect spot for journaling or catching up with friends. And I’m addicted to their ham and cheese croissants! 🥐"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Wow! Great espresso & Macchiato coffee here!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"The best coffee I’ve ever had in my life. It was so good it didn’t have to be a fancy drink, just a soy latte w simple syrup. I am sad that I am not a local."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Unfortunately for this place the coffee is good but the people are awful. Seems they only hire pretentious children who like to cosplay as communists. Even the slightest effort towards customer service would be appreciated, but I won’t be returning."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,The coffee is one of the best I had in a few years. loved it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"I really enjoy the sweet tooth varieties, though I recently tried a ginger/turmeric/oat milk espresso drink that was absolutely delicious! And they always serve drinks at the proper temperature, instead of the scalding feel of most of the large chains. I appreciate what they're up to."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"I really really like this cafe. I have been here 3 times during my vacation. One of my top three cafes in SF. In case you were wondering, my first place award goes to Sight Glass, 2nd to Blue Bottle and Ritual comes in third, although it's excellent and would be a #1 in anyplace that didn't have insanely great coffee quality and great cafes everywhere. Check it out!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Well made coffee, cool spot, but it's not meant to stay for a while. No power or Internet (as is the trend in SF coffee shops) in addition to limited seating means this place is great to stop in for a coffee, but not too stay for a second.  For some reason I prefer this ritual to the one in Hayes or the mission. I think it's just the general atmosphere around the place or they managed to hire even better baristas... Either way, this place is easily one of my favorite coffee shops in the area"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Delicious drinks, good vibes, great branding :)"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Excellent coffee worth every penny! Cute accessories and coffee-making supplies too. Vegan-friendly.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"I want to love this place because they have great vegan options and carry Pepples vegan donuts! But I ordered a decaf oatmilk mocha and it was $7.25 for smaller than a Starbucks small 😨😨 so totally insane. And unfortunately it was somehow, according to my stomach, contaminated with dairy or almond milk. A real bummer. …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Had a watered down chai latte and they don’t have wifi. Who doesn’t have wifi??  Very disappointing experience. It’s had a lot of windows for light which I liked but will definitely not be returning
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Easily the best coffee shop in SF, not only because of the coffee itself but the friendly staff and their passion for quality. So well done every time, always comes out on top amongst the rest. Come grab coffee, sit outside on the bench and people watch in the Haight"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Best coffee I've had in San Fransisco. They have seasonal espresso beans, which are fun. This ritual is usually not too crowded, but is bright and cheery. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,I love this little corner. Had Colombia and Ethiopian coffee both which were amazing taste.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Ordered latte and cappuccino, late was 95% milk, almost no coffee taste. Cappuccino was cold and also pretty bad. 👎👎👎👎👎 I think it highly depends on who is serving, the woman at the counter didnt even say thank you when I paid. …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Pour over coffee for the win! The shop is well lit with the lots of windows allowing you to watch the excitement of Haight street while enjoying great coffee. Space is a little tight, but I've managed to miss the lines so far."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Got the Los Gigantos coffee - loved how fragrant, strong and smooth this blend is! A few observations: we really enjoyed the view of three lovely, well maintained Victorian houses across the street as we drank our coffees in store; no sugar substitutes are available (this may be a good thing); if you don't see creamer or half and half, don't fret, just ask the baristas - they keep it chilled in a fridge that's out of sight."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,The coffee here is very good best place to chill in Haight-Ashbury
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"I love ritual coffees, probably one of the best Espresso in the Bay area. As a side note about the staff, I left my wallet in there and they had it waiting for me when I returned (and it was stuffed with cash.) Always have to appreciate honest employees"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Didn’t like the noisy background. Very sunny morning so the environment is really hot Tried the teen age riot single origin espresso americano. Flavour wasn’t strong. Claimed to have earl grey tea flavour but not strong.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Tasty coffee, ridiculous prices, and a clean but unwelcoming, sterile environment. Worth a visit, but for the high cost and medium taste (relative to local gems like Weaver’s), it is hard to justify and could never be a routine shop. Third wave coffee vibes."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Love it. Been waiting to come here forever. One of the best coffee and customer service in SF. Visiting SF you have to come here. This ritual coffee shop near the buena vista park. Best baristas ever , and customer service just the best."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Came here because of the good coffee, as experienced in other locations, but left disappointed because of the poor attitude. Barely a hello or welcome and definitely not a thank you or goodbye. I’m going to strongly consider other businesses before coming back here."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Music was aggressively bad. It honestly felt like they were trying to get people to leave it was so loud and horrible. If I had to give it a genre I'd call it death funk.  Coffee was okay, it had an interesting taste but was too bitter. Barista gave us a weird look when we asked for milk."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Coffee is good but suuuuuuuuper slow service.....my gosh....why does it take sooooo freakin looooong. Honestly I would NEVER go there if there's more then 2 people in line...and why is it one size only. It's also pretty expensive, but I don't mind paying because it's pretty delicious coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Great coffee but the barista did not know how to make a cortado. I got a latte and after complaining I got another latte a left. They could have done better
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"Normally a good place but the idiot in glasses and red cap was so busy chatting/flirting with another customer that it took him 15 minutes to make 3 drinks.  If you can't work and talk at the same time, then just work"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,"I was excited to have Ritual in Haight Ashbury Dist opened less than one month, at the corner of Haight and Central, with bright, clean, modern decors! Cold brew: delicious, refreshing! Cappuccino: smooth & creamy, by far the best Cappuccino."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1300 Haight St,Good coffee on a sunny quiet corner of Haight Ashbury. Friendly service and good people watching spot
