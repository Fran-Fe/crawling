Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Love love love the ambience! People are friendly and fun to talk with. This feels more like a neighborhood coffee shop. Just had an espresso, no food so can’t comment. But left with an impression that I want to be back if I am in the neighborhood again. Gorgeous cafe!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Subpar experience. The cafe was very busy and the reviews looked good so I decided to check it out. My oat milk latte tasted like straight up milk which was disappointing. I ordered the chicken sandwich. Sandwich was  fine. It came with a side salad that had no dressing on it. There’s a ton of other casual cafes in sf that are far better, I would skip this one"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I got Mexican hot chocolate, which was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Really nice place to sit and work. The vibe is hippy and homey. I got the breakfast burrito - the American style and it was very filling and came with a fruit cup. I enjoyed the chai latte and my friend enjoyed the eggnog latte (4/5).
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Nice little coffee shop. The good is very very good, but the coffee is a little lack luster. I had the hummus plate and my husband had the yogurt with granola and fruit, both of which were tasty. Comfortable environment though. I didn't use the WiFi but you do have to pay for it if you didn't so be aware before you camp out here for awhile."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Great neighborhood Cafe.  I've only eaten breakfast here . The breakfast wraps and croissant sandwiches are freshly made and come with a little bowl of fruit. Coffee is also very good.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"It was a chill place with a lot of beverage and food options. The fresh juices were so good with the option to mix and match your favorite fruits. The coffees , croissants were good and they thoroughly check vaccination proof to be seated inside."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Very unique, and old style coffee house, welcoming atmosphere 😀"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,It's nice place. cozy. it was pretty Packed when I walked in 1:40 p.m. Prices are OK for a large coffee which is medium in most places was 2. 50. The line was not. The guy at the counter was cheerful and what one would hope to expect from a coffee shop. Oh and also coffee is hella good :)  They also have papers straws for all of you plastic straw haters. ...  And they have honey in a bottle not those retarded stupid packets . Thank you!
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Surprisingly buttery, though Simultaneously flaky croissant. I prefer cheddar but the swiss cheese lent a Je ne sais quoi touch. They were out of regular drip so got a cup of Hazelnut.  No orders this apparently and they don't know what they're missing."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Fantastic Food and very good coffee! And a very nice relaxed atmosphere with a good outlook to the street.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Nice quiet coffee shop great service great food and the day I was there we had Musical accompaniment from Normcore
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,This place is great! Easy to relax all morning and their California Wrap was amazing! Great croissants too! The atmosphere makes you feel like in Prague.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,I didn't enjoy the place. Half of the sandwich(tiny) with a green salad $12. I thought salad gonna have olives and avocado. But nope. Just 2 slices of cucumber. +$4 for not such a nice little latte. Coffee was too hot that I couldn't enjoy it. That's weird. So many nice comments. Maybe for smth else
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I love Blue Danube! Their cappuccinos are on point but what stole the show for me was their ham sandwich on ciabatta with CRANBERRY mayo. Maybe I'm a noob, but that combined with the way it was toasted over the melted cheese; them textures & flavas just sent me over the moon.. <3"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Got here on a weekday, sunny morning around 9 am. I love the music that's coming out of the speakers. I love the bespectacled blonde daddy who's sitting on the brown leather sofa across the room. He's absorbed in his 12"" laptop screen. His shoes and pullover match and are both expensive like his jawline. Is he FAANG product manager? Was he a model in a previous life? So many unknowns. But, what i know is that the counter people were nice to me, made a fabulous oat milk latte and laughed at my attempt at being funny. I tipped %20 but i could do more, if i had a rich daddy!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Love their house coffee
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"This will be my very first review and I felt compelled to do so because my boyfriend and I were so jazzed to try this place out we even drove an hour on empty stomachs so that when we arrived and got our food we could totally grub out on what looks to be total mouthwatering delicious dishes! Walking through their door, I'm surprised that everyone in the establishment didn't hear our stomachs growling in celebration that we had finally arrived and were finally going to be able to grub after our long trip here. I go to the counter and order my food and the gentleman working says to me....  ....""OH YA, UMM SORRY, OUR KITCHEN CLOSED AT 6"" 😳😭🤯  NO WHERE ONLINE DOES IT MENTION THAT THEIR KITCHEN CLOSES EARLY! NO WHERE!!!!  I'm rating them a 2 because you can't deny that their food looks amazing, but then again I'm rating them a 2 because we were unable to order anything! Long travel, empty stomachs and leaving VERY UNHAPPY! This all could have been avoided! It's a simple fix. I really suggest that online you let your customers know that you close your doors at 7, but (the most important time of all) you shut down your kitchen at 6.  Really wishing I could have tried their food. Maybe next time I'm out this way the stars will align, but one thing is for sure, they won't be the sole reason for my travels to this area anymore. ** 😔 what a let down, totally disappointed **"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Super delicious coffee!!!! very peaceful and cozy  little place
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"delicious, but the food and drinks are much pricier than what is listed on google maps"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Came here for a first date ended up marrying the guy! The gluten free sandwich was also pretty good.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Vanilla latte was tasty...lots of options for coffee and food...one or two gluten free snacks
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Nice little coffee place in a very likeable neighbourhood
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Good coffee, great food. Nice people. Try the Hungarian coffee cake. Yummy 😋 …"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Fills the need for coffee on a street that doesn't have a ton of cafes. Has decent indoor seating and quite a few people busily tapping away on laptops. Staff were friendly but felt a little overpriced.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Vanilla Latte was good, lots of people reading books inside…not sure what they do for a living."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I was looking for a coffee shop where I could work a couple hours and have a slight lunch. The Blue Danube was perfect. Very nice vibe, most people were doing the same as I was. Food is good (had the greek breakfast wrap). Coffee is good. Yes, you pay for internet: $2 for 2hrs, I think it's okay. You can always use your hotspot if you don't and in a way you are paying for ""camping"" which is fine. Constructive criticism: maybe the internet could be a tad faster. Big plus: there's a few power outlets. And the neighborhood is nice and safe, plus the Green Apple Bookstore is just a couple blocks away. Will definitely go back during my next visit."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"This coffeeshop is quiet, artsy, funky and super cute. I got a soy vanilla latte and it was excellent. Paired with their pumpkin chocolate chip bread, it was AMAZING. seriously if you’re a fan of pumpkin bread, don’t miss out on theirs. I’ll definitely be back here!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"This is my second visit to Blue Danube Coffee House. Good coffee, good atmosphere. A new go-to spot for a quick meal or coffee. Plus, it’s on Clement Street which I find endlessly interesting."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Went there for the first time this afternoon. Very comfortable neighborhood coffee tea sandwich treats place. Wow! Very impressed with variety and amount of stuff they have. Coffee was hot and vegan brownie was one of best I've eaten in a long long time. I'm going back for sure!
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Great food and coffee, tried the French toast, best I've ever had. Ideal place to spend a day working from home"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Love a cafe that has every kind of drink available - coffee, tea, Italian soda, and beer/wine. Cozy seating for small groups. Grab some local dim sum and enjoy a slow afternoon here."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Nice place with indoor and outdoor seating. Staff gave good service. Restrooms are not in order per the sign. Had latte and it was fine. If you are going to use their wi-fi the password is unique and free for only good for 2 hours.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Most importantly, my latte was tasty.  However, I don't really like the feel of this place. Prices are high. They charge for WiFi. $5 CC minimum, including using phone payment. And when I used my own mug, I ended up in a debate about whether it was 12 or 16 oz --- it says 12 on the bottom, but, more importantly, just assume a personal mug is a small.  On other words, within the first 2 minutes of entering, I had 4 negative encounters before even tasting the coffee."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Cute small coffee shop. They charge $$ for wi-fi access. That’s cheap and costs 1 star.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Nice little shop but the WiFi costs 2$ for 2 hrs. It'll cost some stars here.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Had a latte, it was fine. Price was fair. Atmosphere is very cute. Nice cafe to be in when the weather is hot as the windows will be open to the sidewalk letting cool air in.  Definitely a warm and welcoming place to go, eat, drink, and chill."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"It’s alright as a coffee shop but I think it’s very cheap that you have $2 for two hours per device to use Wifi. Even after buying coffee or food. So decided not to go there again. Who charges for Wifi in a coffee shop, that too in bay area of all places."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,They refused to allow my three year old to use the bathroom after we had already bought drinks.  Unclear if there's a public bathroom available or if they didn't recognize us as customers.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,An absolutely adorable coffee/drink shop. Lots of seating. Great artwork on the walls. Great location (can stop here for a drink as you wait for your name to be called in nearby restaurants). I enjoyed a glass of wine here on a cold evening. Loved the ambience!
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Really great tea! Food was ok, but it took a while to come out. I was surprised to find that they charge $2 for access to WiFi (for two hours), and it’s really slow. Not only that, but the only signage of this is tiny! And there is zero verbal communication of the WiFi charge while you’re ordering, so you end up having to stand in line twice. The charging stations are also quite small, so you can barely fit one laptop charging box in them.  Other than that, it’s friendly service. Come here if you just want to hang out, and have time to spare. If you are planning to get some work done, make sure your laptop is fully charged and you don’t need fast WiFi."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Friendly staff, surprisingly large menu, and interesting art.  But trendy actually means no space between seats, zero elbow room, poorly cleaned, and customers pay $2 for what can only be dial-up internet being shared by eleven other patrons that look like they've been nursing a small coffee all day and have no intentions to leave."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"An SF local told me about this Outer Richmond hidden gem. It’s a great place to work on projects if you have 100% charged devices and don’t really need internet. Personally I feel SF is way to plugged in and it’s a nice way to just work without any crazy emails and notification sounds and distractions. I like the juices (apple, celery, beets, etc etc). A healthy way to enjoy my $6 instead of other coffee competitor places that force you to buy overpriced coffee."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I use to go there often, but now it's  hard to find a table. It's all occupied by people with laptops."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"One of my absolute favorite Cafes to bring a book, have coffee and one of their great cakes, carrot or Hungarian Coffee cake, and hang out in San Francisco! But then again, Budapest is my favorite City to visit, having been their 25 times. It must have to do with the Blue Danube."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Blue Danube is a cool little local coffee shop on Clement Street. They make a good cup of coffee as well as great latte drinks. I also like their breakfast items like egg sandwiches, yogurts or smoothies. This place will get crowd on the weekends if you don't stop by early. There is definitely a college coffee shop feel here when school is in session. Overall good selection and definitely a regular stop for more."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I absolutely love Blue Danube. This is my go to neighborhood coffee shop, and it's got a great vibe. It can get pretty crowded, but if you go in early around 8, it's a great place to relax with some espresso and a good book! Their food is delicious, too.  Their breakfast wraps are my favorite. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the Inner Richmond and craving caffiene!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"What a disappointment! I visited this quirky coffee house five years ago and really enjoyed the coffee, the atmosphere and the free wifi. Now when I return expecting the same, I'm greeted with slow, pay per hour wifi system, no plugs, and a cash only place that REEKS of bad onions and tuna.  I gave the place two stars because the coffee wasn't terrible, but don't plan on studying there or having a decent conversation with your friends -- your nose will fall off from the smell!  I don't like writing poor reviews, but here was a coffee house that initially got everything right, and now is a place I will probably never visit again."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"My favorite place to get hot tea in the morning. Loose leaf tea variety is not very big (I'd love to see some Assam and Darjeeling), but at least the choices they have are outside of the typical American ""Earl Grey"" and ""English Breakfast"". Very friendly staff, a shelf with some random books, nice art on the walls and some of the tables."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Everytime i go, the cafe is crowded so it might seem more small than it is, but it's small. The food portions are nice and the food is good. I don't love this place but I like it. It's the kind of cozy laid back place with a good menu selection that I'd like to love, but I'm not sure why I just like it."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Addictive. Cozy & sunny. Amazing teas and coffees, salads all day long. Love that spot"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Loved the croissant, decent coffee, nice ambience, friendly waiter!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Grab your croissants from arsicault and stop in for great coffee and atmosphere
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,7-11-18: Excellent small cappuccino and pastry for $6.25; less expensive than other two cafes I go to in area. Also friendly quick service. I like the atmosphere as well
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Adorable local cafe and coffee shop. Pretty big menu for a place this size. Crowded but not overwhelmed when we visited on Sunday prime time.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Have to pay for the WiFi actually crazy 🫠🫠🫠 …
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Very cozy and popular cafe/breakfast place. Delicious coffee! Will return for their breakfast items
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I LOVE THIS COFFEE HOUSEEEEE. But it's not super great for studying if you  need a big table to spread out on. It can also get pretty loud. But the drinks and the food are delicious, and the drink with ghiradelli chocolate and espresso that's blended? Delicious. And kept me up all night, perfect for finals!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Great local coffee shop. Plenty of seating and the menu ranges from coffee to smoothies to sandwiches, breakfast and salads. Coffee is reasonably priced too and served in big mugs. Will definitely be coming back here. 😃 …"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Even though I don't live in the neighborhood, I've been here several times. Its just got a cool, casual vibe, good food, and friendly staff. some notables: -french toast with baked apples and filled with cream cheese - amazing! -the tuna salad salad is my goto -many healthy and yummy food options -smoothies are unique and delicious. Tip: if you're watching your sugar intake, you can ask for No Syrup. -variety of coffee/espresso drinks, including slow drip-style coffee and hot/cold vietnamese coffees -different artists/photographers featured each month on the walls - check it out! -Last tip: Cash only, but there's an ATM across the street"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"They have a few vegan treats (not made in house, but local) in addition to bagels and sandwiches that can be modified. The drinks are superb too!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Cool spot to get smoothies or coffee.  Outdoor seating, and some limited inside seating.  House coffee was good, I got a small 8oz.  Prices are fair.  Wife got smoothie which she enjoyed."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"A classic clement spot, this is a fun place to hang out with friends or just read. Comfy sofas and tables inside and outside. The large windows in the front and the mirrors inside give it plenty of natural light. They also have good mixed juices and yummy coffee drinks."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Friendly service and delicious food! Atmosphere is artistic and academic - great place for journaling
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Very cute coffee shop local to where I live. The food always looks amazing though I haven't actually eaten there. The coffee and smoothies are amazing!!! Its a very cute place, always packed! I recommend it!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I really liked this place and basically everything about it. I really liked the music, the food and drinks, and everything just had a vibe. Will go there again."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,I love the service! The lady was so nice! I didn’t like the drink I ordered and I asked for something different and she had no problem switching my drink for free! And the fruit cup I ordered was amazing as well.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"they messed up my order twice. before paying, i even asked if the other drink was iced (to be sure). they said yes. but i ended up getting 2 hot lattes 😀 …"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Good food, good coffee, good vibes"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Great place for coffee and snacks. Super comfy environment. It's like having coffee in your living room with friends, except it's a neighborhood coffee shop and you don't know any of your friends."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,BLT good.  Fast.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,The wifi is a trap! You have to pay for it and it can't load most pages. The tea was good even if I did feel sightly like a sardine in here...
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I don’t write reviews often but felt inspired to as this cafe charges for WiFi in 2020. Pluses: they have my favorite Harney and Sons Paris tea, friendly staff that kindly charged my very dead phone for me Minuses: internet costs $2 for every 2 hours (!) Neutral: food is pricey (chicken salad cost me $17, but hey it is SF after all)"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I love this neighborhood cafe. It's a great spot to sit, on a sunny day in the window and ""work"". I like the hulk smoothie, makes it easy to pretend to be healthy."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Great coffee, excellent food. It's a small place and often crowded but there is outdoor seating. The smoothies are delicious."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Super friendly staff, excellent coffee and great vibe"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Nice place to grab a good cup of coffee, and food for breakfast and lunch. They let you sit and study or read for as long as you wish. It's clean and fairly quiet."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Great coffee, pastries, and small plates in a somewhat bohemian setting surrounded by Chinese businesses. Across from Burma Superstar."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,The macchiato was good. The dessert selection was limited. But we didn't have any sandwiches there. Though it looked tempting.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,I love the vibe of this place. It feels like I’m inside a novel. Also the food’s great!
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Very expensive, loud, and wifi COSTS MONEY! $2 for 2 hours of wifi, even if you buy a drink. Why do people come back here? Probably because it's the only coffee shop in the immediate area."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Cozy little cafe. Great coffee. Only downside is that you have to pay for very slow WiFi. I ended up using my phone as a hotspot after paying for it.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,No coffee shop should close at 5pm when people are everywhere trying to get a cup. Hours are awful
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"A really strange little coffee shop with average coffee and below average pastries. Everything is a bit pricey for what you get, and it’s not the most comfortable place to hang out."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Nice environment, not a fan of the coffee. The wifi is NOT free. This cafe maybe best for face to face conversations vs getting work done."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Love this place! Best place to sit inside/outside on a nice day and work.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Coffee is cheap, space is cozy, but the internet (which you have to pay for inexplicably) is unusably slow. And there's only 4 people on computers."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Reliable place for coffee and wine/beer while waiting for a table to open up nearby for dinner. Smoothies also are great.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"A cute, cozy place to hang out with a book or a friend. They serve a variety of coffee, food, and drinks, and it's nice they're open late!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Super cute spot but food was not good. Cobb salad had cubed processed chicken and grilled cheese had very little cheese.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Credit Card minimum of $5  WiFi is not free and $1 per hour  Prices seemed fair compared to other options in the area  Didn’t try anything else but the coffee has alternative sweeteners so I was content
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"The vibe is cool, but they have credit card minimums and charge for WiFi. (No free WiFi.) It's 2017, I feel like these are the basics."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"This is a great place to go to study.  Good coffee, atmosphere, and wifi.  It's really close to the USF campus too."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,I love the blue Danube cafe the tables have cool designs are there hot chocolate is the best.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Great spinach and mushroom quiche but charging for wifi at a coffeeshop? Come on, it isn't 1999..."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"If you have to confirm with EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER that the small for $2 is only 8oz, then obviously customer expectations are different than what you're selling and you should up the size or lower the price."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Excellent. Lovely coffee shop. Nice people. Good coffee. Good pastries. All good good good.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Really great, fresh smoothies and coffee!"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Small neighborhood coffee and lunch place, decent selection, cozy, relaxed vibe, with indoor and outdoor seating."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Good chill coffee place, has comcast WiFi in range or pay a bit"
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Food was ok service ok but I was shocked that I had to pay for internet.  Not for travelers unless you have a data plan
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Coffee was above average. I like the environment and seating. Very comfortable.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,The finest classic cafe for decades.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Great food menu. Solid coffee. Good vibes.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,WiFi isn’t free! Everything else is fine but don’t come here to get work done.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Very nice coffee place, reasonable price and amazing foods."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"I like this place however, they charge WiFi.t That’s ridiculous…"

Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Delicious lox bagel
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Wide selection of food and drink, including delicious smoothies.  Outlets, wifi, and plenty of seating."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Lovely little cafe. Very original. Coffee was really good.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Not very friendly service. CHARGE for WiFi, too. Used to be great, now not."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Good place to get a pastry & a cup o' Joe while your car is @ Toyota! 😁 …
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Food and coffee and delicious. Service was slow but worth the wait.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,This went downhill in a year from great vibe/Wi-Fi to really apathetic counter help and extra paid Wi-Fi.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Good solid neighborhood joint you can reliably count on.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Very nice coffee place, reasonable price and amazing foods."
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and my Pear-a-dise is so delicious!!"

Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,This coffee house is fine - OK - could be cleaner.
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Get the Rosemary Chicken Sandwich! So good! 🥪🥪🥪
Blue Danube Coffee House,306 Clement St,Had a cappuccino. Coffee is old style burnt. Mr Espresso. Unhappy.
