Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"This location isn't crowded, or it's at least 4 or 5 people in line, and it moves quickly. The orders are just about perfect and hot. Snacks, WiFi, and places to sit are available. Parking is so and so."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Employees are always friendly, welcoming, helpful, knowledgeable, smiling, etc. It's such a pleasure to patronize this store and leave a dollar tip. I only wish I could leave more for people who do their jobs well. Thanks, coming from a black man."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,I have visited this Starbucks a few times with my little kids and the experience has always been positive.  The baristas always took great care in preparing kids’ hot chocolate - so delicious and never scalding hot.  We stopped by again today and the kid’s hot chocolate was perfect as always and everyone was very sweet and kind to my kid.  Thank you for making our visit sweet!
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,This Starbucks is placed in a nice location however the drinks are not good. I’ve ordered several drinks from here over the last year and all of them taste like watered down versions of what they should be.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"As always Starbucks is my fave place to have coffee. On my drive home from SFO airport, I stopped at this place and had good coffee & had croissants."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Typical Starbucks. Nice staff, very clean store."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Wow!! If you are a tourist, COME HERE! Coffee is great, bathroom is available (which is near impossible in DT San Fran) and the staff is very friendly."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Typical Starbucks right around the corner from whole foods. Good coffee; good service; convenient location.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,The best customer service I love going to this Starbuck
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Good service but last Friday I bought Dragon Frinks, I paid with my card and they charged me $222.75 just for that, I went back to claim and the person who was attending there told me that he couldn't do anything, I needed the receipt, but when I bought them at no time did I did they give a bad service receipt?😡 …"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Lot of seating. Has power outlets.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,They list their hours as 7PM but close at 5PM. So it was a very bad experience.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,We just stopped by to use their restroom.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Great!! I love this one its always friendly staff. The area is cool too accessible to bus and car. It's a really mellow place to sip and relax out of the elements. I get a coffee and warmed up chocolate chip cookie. Only thing I wish my hot drinks would be really hot not warm. I usually have to reheat my drink up at work. Other than that it's a short guy there early in the morning who's really friendly and awesome. He always tells me about new drinks, but he always knows my usual drink too. He's so awesome keep him there. 🤘🏾🤘🏾"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"drinks are actually made very well, but the store stinks like dirty wet mop and feet. and one of you employees was just staring at me when I walked in. there was like 5 people and only 2 we're doing stuff"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"The only good thing about this place is their extended hours, incl. on holidays. Used to have good baristas, used to have good coffee (the clover-brewed stuff) and used to have good pastries. Not so anymore. You’re lucky if you get what you actually ordered after only asking once. It attracts its fair share of vagrants and weirdos so I can understand why people would rather work at a different location."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"One of the nicest Starbucks teams , and not the fake type (forced to be nice) that I have seen yet . Very nice area and spot for a coffee."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Out of the 10 different drinks I've ordered here, the five different times I've been here this year,  I'd say they made 6 right. They really should change the sign in the window though waste of time walking there today cuz it says 5:30 in the window but apparently they close at 5:00."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Yeah their coffee is King but I love the egg bites with bacon and cheese.  Very low in carbs good source of protein and delicious!  And as a diabetic I get to eat something I really like without having to feel at all guilty about it!
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"This Starbucks has good service but a little slow.  Lots of low brow, blue collar territorial anywhere I go customers with deeply unsatisfied natures moderate the environment southward.  Best part about them is the early reliability but I consider them a caffeine go to not a flavor go to."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Wonderful staff and great Frappuccinos!
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"This Starbucks location is mostly clean and welcoming. What makes me give them only a 3 Star Rating is the fact that management/owners keep changing and limiting its operating hours. When adressing this with the staff there, I was told that they lack the customers to justify staying open later/past office hours of the nearby office buildings. With Whole Foods very close by, operating until 10 P.M. daily and having always a good amount of customer traffic, this does not seem right to me."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Worst Starbucks store ever. Staff here are rude and make mistakes all the time.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,I messed up on an online order once and put pickup location at a another store. The staff at this store was so nice enough to fix it for me. Everybody here is friendly and helpful especially at 5 in the morning. thank you.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Great store layout and conveniently located on Kansas and 16th Street. I like that there is lots of natural light due to the large window fronts and enough space inside to either sit down and relax or queue up for your drink without hassle.  Also, parking is available most of the time on one of the surrounding streets. Great Starbucks and I like coming here!  They close relatively early though (9pm)."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Always great Service. Cindy and her Team are Fantastic. (Just wish they still served my Chai tea and had honey)
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"This is a cozy little Starbucks with a friendly staff.  They serve the breakfast wraps, which not all Starbucks do.  Today I was pleased when the barista said ""sometimes they center of the wrap can end up a little chilly; would you to like me to double-toast it?""  I thought that was a nice touch.  The number of people using laptops at the bar abutting the window made me think this was a friendly place to get some work done."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"I'm upgrading my previous 4-star review to 5-star. My prior 4-star rating was based primarily on slower counter service compared to the Peets in Potrero Center. Since that report, however, I've been using the Starbucks app to pre-order my beverage. I've found that, even with somewhat complex instructions, my order has been ready after submitting my request just 3 to 5 minutes before arriving at the 16th & Kansas Starbucks store. The staff at this location have been very friendly and customer service oriented. 5-stars!"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Really friendly attentive staff. Always say hi to me by name. Always have things ready fast.
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"My quad espresso macchiato was fine. It was still reasonably warm and with foam when I arrived home.  There was only one person in front of me waiting to order, which took over 2 minutes, for some reason. However, quite a few earlier customers were milling about, waiting for their orders to be fulfilled. So the whole process from time of my arrival at the 16th & Kansas location to delivery of my beverage took over 10 minutes. That's quite a bit longer than what it takes at my usual weekday go-to café, Peets on 16th Street in Potrero Center.  Fortunately, today being Saturday, I was not in a hurry. I'll try this location again on a weekday and see what happens."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Starbucks IS Wonderful👎‼️ The short stocky women behind the counter has ""ALL The CHARM"" of  a👹RABID👺PITBULL👹👎 She's The BEAST Reason I KNOW💭 to AVOID THIS Starbucks👎‼️"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Beverage are ok. A ""to-go"" place, I don't want to sit there the atmosphere and music usually is stressful and invites us to leave. The service is fast, friendly-ish though I never got a ""goodbye"" answer here..."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Hey, it's a Starbucks.  They always cure my sweet-tooth.  I wish they would bring back some of the normal hot teas, like, camomile, green teas that are bitter, jasmine, etc.  I like that I can hang out to do some work if I wanted to."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"They have a Clover, but Clover coffee prices are a dollar more than I've seen elsewhere in the US. I waited ten minutes for my order, only to find out that it had been sitting out a while by the Clover machine... there was no one else in the store, so I don't understand why they didn't call it out or think to ask the lone gentleman standing by the other drink counter. They also got the order of one member of my party wrong---she asked for an ""Iced Chai Latte,"" she then corrected them when they recorded it as an ""Iced Latte,"" yet she still received an iced latte. Will not return."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Starbucks is not providing hot cup of water anymore. Good bye Starbucks coffee
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,So I give this two stars because their employees I was the only person in the store and I dropped 80 bucks and I leave as someone goes into the store now this person has to go to the cashier and then make his way over to where I was standing when I lost the money the people working there saw him pick it up after making his order and didn't think anything of it even though he had not made it that far across the story yet so I irritated and out of 80 bucks so that's why I rated them two stars
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Classic. Iconic seattle coffee chain. There is no one like it. Not the best coffee game in town, but solid. Kinda like the Paul Rudd of coffee shops."
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Friendly staff, humored me when i asked them to seal the drink so i could bring it home in the pannier of a motorcycle.  Turns out that is still not such an amazing plan 🤣 …"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Good coffee, nasty bathroom!  The bathroom has a code lock so there is no excuse for how dirty it is. Gross!"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Lots of seating, great staff, and not a whole lot of traffic. Awesome place to sit for a couple of hours to get work done."

Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Very loud music, employees hardly hear what you want. You have to repeat repeat again again until your voice broken"

Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"They don't make the drinks according to the customizations via the mobile app, even though the sticker printed on the cup lists them"
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,Terrible service! The baristas are talking between them all the time ignoring the line and the people waiting to get their orders!
Starbucks,350 Rhode Island St,"Nice location... I travel a lot, and this one has a lot of room to sit down and enjoy that cup of coffee."
