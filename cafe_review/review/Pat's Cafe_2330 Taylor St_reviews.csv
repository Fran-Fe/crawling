Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Was walking around town and stumbled upon Pat's Cafe. Looked like a little hole in the wall and decided to give it a try, because why not.  The Food: After browsing their menu, it was hard to decide on something, but eventually I landed on the ""French Toast Special"". The French Toast was amazing. Huge pieces of toast and the flavor from the cinnamon and syrup were delicious! I got mine with scrambled eggs and sausage. The sausage was good, but lacked a bit of something. I can't really put my finger on it, but it was just okay. The eggs were good, just normal eggs.  The Service: Service was great! The wait staff were friendly and accommodating. They definitely made our meal more enjoyable.  The Atmosphere: Restaurant is nicely decorated. Definitely a hole in the wall spot. Plenty of seating indoors.  Overall, a 4/5! Pretty good breakfast/diner food here. Food and staff were amazing, highly recommend giving the place a try!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,We went here for breakfast and the food was really good and the staff were very friendly. We were a party of 9 and they were able to accommodate us quickly. The prices were decent for the area and close to the Marriott Hotel. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a sit down breakfast place.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Pats cafe is THE place for breakfast in north San Fran! Staying at fisherman’s wharf we wanted to go out and grab breakfast. We saw pats cafe on Google thought they looks fun. Fun is just the surface the food is delicious. The stuff are friendly and the place has real character. We loved it so much we went back twice. We’d been traveling across America from New York to Texas then San Fran. We even dropped by the morning we were leaving to Japan. This is the breakfast spot right next to municipal station to so downtown folks are just a ride away. It’s just a fact, go to Pat’s!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"From day one we had a warm and friendly welcome from the staff and from Pat. A substantial menu was offered and proved to be the most perfect place for brunch. The food and drinks served were spot on and just perfect, with great size portions and nothing too much trouble for this fussy Englishman!  Thank you to all of the staff who made each and every visit so enjoyable and for the coffee that was waiting for us as soon as we walked through the door.  We walked to Pat's from the Greenwich Steps, where we were staying, and every step was worth it."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"It was one of the best breakfast cafes in SF. We ordered the pancakes,  Mexican style chilaquile, and Pat's omelet. All the dishes were really tasty, especially the pancakes."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,So good we had it twice on our visit to SF. Smoked Salmon Benedict and crab cake Benedict were absolutely perfect. The service was excellent and it has a nice local vibe. Eat indoors or outside on the front patio.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,What a great spot! Literally steps off the trolley this place is great.  The food was super fast and delicious.  The sec is was great and the atmosphere reminded me of a diner from another time.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Nice little quaint place. My husband had ""El ranchero"" (similar to huevos rancheros) and he loved it, he said it was the best breakfast he had in our stay in SF. I had the Corned beef hash, it was good but it had a lot of fat and the toast was too toasted for my liking. The chai latte was delicious! Super creamy. The only thing I didn't like is that you can't do any substitutions, I don't eat eggs, so I ordered my dish with no eggs but would have liked something in exchange like they do in other places. Service was great, very nice servers."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Apparently quite the breakfast institute in San Francisco, there was a short queue to get a seat. Staff was very friendly, portions were good and food was nicely presented & tasty. An enjoyable breakfast place."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Great old school diner style breakfast/lunch spot located near fisherman's wharf area of San Francisco. I went for brunch around 1pm the place was pretty empty.  Service was fast and efficient.  I decided to get the California omelette which I thought was very good but over priced.  Overall Pat's Cafe is a good choice if you're looking for a nice home style breakfast.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Researched this place and couldn’t wait to come here for a brunch! Amazing service from the minute when you walk in and food is lovely 🤩 egg Benedict are unfortunately only served at the weekend but I had San Fran omelette and pancake with fruits. Coffee if just perfect 👍🏻 definitely a stop you can’t miss!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,San Francisco omlete was very good and the French toast. The staff were very kind and swift!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Loved this adorable cafe. Perfect place to go for a casual breakfast. The service is outstanding, coffee was constantly being filled. The salmon Benedict was full of flavor and a little messy but worth it."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Lovely, authentic, warm welcome and delicious diner food. Local artists display on walls. Love the Feeling of this place."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,These guys were getting their buts KICKED! Absolutely crazy busy but the guy behind the counter was amazingly patient with us dumb tourists!! So kind and fast as could be!! I got french toast which was absolutely slayed the table. That was also some glorious bacon. You gotta go! Just please wait in line out front at the sign. They’ll get you don’t worry!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"I had the California omelette, it practically was a omelette wrapping the ingredients. It was not cooked together in one piece as omelette should be. The taste wasn't great, just normal. I wouldn't go back again. And it's more expensive than the menu on Google map reports."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Very quaint and busy local breakfast stop that has a wide range of options for those who love a hearty morning meal. The menu includes a wide range of options though I wished for a few more standard offerings like basic eggs, toast, sausage, etc. Lots of omelettes and scrambled eggs but less basic meals in some ways. The service was quick and efficient and the portions were appropriate. They even provided a take away coffee which was great to keep me going the rest of the morning."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Quick stop after church. Our last breakfast in San Francisco. Pat's Cafe was fast and efficient. Kids had chocolate milk that they enjoyed mixing themselves. My wife's croissant sandwich was huge. Also nice that each of the plates comes with a little slice of watermelon.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"First time in California, specifically San Francisco & couldn't have done any better! I'm a religious breakfast eater and Pat's Cafe won't be forgotten! French Toast & Home Fries were slammin!!!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,I ordered the California omelette and a mimosa. The service was standard. It was a Friday morning and everything felt very relaxed. The food was good. I would return. Definitely split the meals. The omelette was made for 2 for sure.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,This is their crabcake Benedict and it was amazing! I asked for extra Hollandaise sauce and they put it right where I asked. Server was friendly. It was a bit pricey for a breakfast but it was worth it!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,I would have really liked to give this place an extra star. The omelette was that good. Location and atmosphere were on point. Wayyy overpriced. Toast and bacon were neglected in the toaster/fryer. Coffee was average
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Can get busy on weekends, but we arrived early and beat the crowd. Service is exceptional and the food is good, but nothing noteworthy, especially being in San Francisco amongst so many amazing breakfast spots. I didn’t find Pat’s chicken apple sausages as savory as those from other places. The French toast was good, but also not as good and moist as other spots. Coffee was not strong enough for my tastes. Everything was just okay."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"So, I am a FA and for me is always SFO a breakdown into my pocket.  Pat's Cafe was recommended several times before, and I finally made it this time. And let me tell you, this visit didn't disappoint. The House cafe was good and I highly recommend the Mexican Omelette. First of all, I was down when I saw the omelet, but then after I discovered the inside: *mwah*."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Everything is great here. The waiters are friendly and the Food is delicious. Overall a great Choice for everyone who Needs a fast ans yummy breakfast.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Got the salmon and feta scrambled eggs and California omelette.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Food was good. I had the California omelette ($17.95) with bell peppers added. I thought it was kinda funny that the ingredients were all on the plate and the egg was just placed on top of it, rather than mixed it, but whatever. I also had the pomegranate mimosa ($9.95). It was good. Service was also good. The only thing that startled me was the smell when I walked in. Like they'd maybe done a typical deep clean the night before and it was still kinda sitting. Nobody else seemed to be bothered by it and I didnt read any other reviews for it so probably just a one off."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The food was good and the guys were friendly and helpful
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Great cafe, amazing choice of food on the menu. Staff were attentive and friendly. Food was good, I ate the veggie sandwich and my husband had the veggie wrap. Both tasted amazing and came with fries. Pretty good value for money considering it’s near north beach and a tourist area. Would recommend if your in the area. They also sell prints of San Francisco, which are good and not too expensive."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,We came here for breakfast and the food & coffee was delicious. It's not very large inside and we got there early so there was no wait. The staff was friendly and great about refilling the coffee. Lots of great local artwork on the wall for sale. Would definitely come here again.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Came here for a low key weekend brunch with friends - I got the pancake special and the pancakes were fluffy and delicious! I went for the OG but they have lots of tasty flavor combos to customize your pancakes, my friends tried the versions with fruit and they looked great!  Overall, the food was a little pricier than I expected but I suppose it's also based on the restaurant location"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,A “cute” cafe that turned out better than expected. I enjoyed a cold salmon eggs Benedict that had wonderful hollandaise sauce.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"We order from Pat's almost every weekend, it's a semi-consistent option for a lazy morning breakfast. I've had some issues with orders being correct but can overlook that however, today I ordered a waffle and the cup of syrup was literally one quarter full not even close to enough to cover 1 portion of the waffle. And the waffle is so dry I can't even eat it without syrup. Pretty disappointed and we are looking for another breakfast spot near us. I guess if you are eating in you will receive better care but for a takeout spot it's not a great option."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"This was a cute quaint restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. We were able to get seated quickly and our server was very friendly. My hubby got the french toast but unfortunately he did not care for them only because he decided he is not a sourdough bread fan but I did taste them and they were decent, I do think the sourdough bread does give a slight different taste. I had the eggs and pancakes which were very good. The home fries/potatoes were cooked well but didn't have any seasoning and the bacon seemed to be tough and old, we did ask for fresh bacon and it was better. The hot chocolate was delish but the latte was decent. Overall, we enjoyed eating here and enjoyed our seat in the front window."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,This place is amazing! Special orders are absolutely no problem and the food is delicious. It would be worth it traveling to sf again only for this cafe! It is quiet expensive for european standards but you won't find anything much cheaper cause it's sf...
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Great place. I will use the phrase ""hole in the wall"" and hope it means the same thing in San Francisco. We loved it. Great food, cute little tucked away location close to everything."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Breakfast here was very nice. Food is good as well. The only thing is the bacon was really well done. Make sure to request how you like that. Other than that I enjoyed this cute little cafe
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Super cool Café, I love all the artwork on the walls and the cozy atmosphere! Food was delicious and the service impeccable! Amazing place, will eat here again whenever I come back in town! 😊"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"great restaurant for locals and people visiting SF! We got there right before they opened (since i had a full day of activities planned for my friend who was visiting) and we were the first people there. i'm glad we got there early because within 30 min, the restaurant was packed!!  the food came out to us very quickly and everything tasted excellent! they need more waiters, but the service was still good. there were some rude large parties wanting to push tables together, likely tourists. can't wait to go back!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Arrived at 7.40 for breakfast and were seated near the window. A few clients already seated and place started to fill up quickly. However, we ordered promptly, coffee served but after 35 minutes our breakfast still hadn't arrived. After reminding the server he told us it was coming but it took another 7 or 8 minutes to finally arrive."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Pat's has been around a long time and is a great spot. That said the prices are getting to be outrageous. I ordered pancakes with one egg and bacon. Had a coffee and added one additional egg to my order and the total after I tipped the waiter 20% was $35. Spending $35 on breakfast is a little ridiculous. Have been coming here off and on when I'm in SF but I won't be back again.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The guys working here are absolute clowns. We walked in to a half empty restaurant and no one acknowledged us for several minutes. In that time two more parties walked in and we are all now crowded in the entry. We got seated but were the last to get menus and only after asking. We started noticing several tables getting the food who you guessed came in and ordered after us. The server finally came to us to let us know our ticket never went thru to the kitchen 'because of the tablet'. We left and had a completely opposite experience at Hollywood cafe. Major waste of time.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"My husband and I went for our breakfast here while visiting San Francisco. There are many places to dine in. We chose here as online, it had excellent reviews. We chose right, as the food and service were both excellent 👌. Highly recommend 😁👍😁"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Nice casual cafe for breakfast and lunch. The French toast special I had was okay; could be improved with cinnamon. The pancakes though was a pleasant surprise; probably one of the fluffiest pancake that I've ever tasted. Staff are friendly, service is reasonably quick, decor inside is filled with local artwork for sale and the place is clean and well spaced out."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Great location... no large hills to climb to get to it. Comfortable artsy in decor, huge menu that is diverse, weekend specials. Outdoor seating area that is covered but best for a couple small parties of 2 or 3. Can make espresso type drinks. 1/3 the cost of some hotel breakfasts. Photo shows ciliquilles and French toast plates."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,We were visiting fisherman's ward - yet wanted a good local spot for breakfast - Pats was fantastic- good coffee - veggie omelette had fresh veggies - broccoli asparagus tomato onion spinach feta - excellent and good potatoes with sourdough toast - my lovely wife had oatmeal with raisins bananas cinnamon - she skipped the walnuts - overall a must place for breakfast so much better than the tourist spots and it's just 0.3 miles from warf area
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Always a go to when I’m in town. Great service from the staff, amazing breakfast and lunch and delicious mimosas!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Walkable diner from our hotel While visiting San Francisco. Every bite was delicious. Freshly cooked. House coffee is amazing. It is a must try.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Steak and eggs was tasty! Food was delivered pretty quickly. During our visit there were several staff members all working to help eachother out!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,I can see why there was a line out the door earlier in the brunch hour. I'm glad I came back closer to close when it was a little more quiet  The home fries were perfectly crispy and the coffee was so rich and wonderful. The chorizo burrito was the perfect brunch size!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"We have lived around the corner of Pat's for nesrlu 7 years but finally made it here when we both had a day off. Everything was great. All the food was very ""home"" feeling. Pictured is the French toast with fruit, American style chilequiles and the egg burrito.  Worth noting is that the burrito and chilequiles both came with potatoes but didn't say so on the menu so don't be like us and order a side of potatoes we didn't need!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"The best french toast I've ever had. In the other pic is californian omelette, which was brilliant too. Everything with tea and tips was 50$."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"California omelet was very tasty, and the atmosphere was very good. My daughter did the Nutella crepes, which she  enjoyed. Little to rich for my breakfast tastes, lol."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Lovely small cafe, friendly and attentive service. Delicious food. I really enjoyed the chai tea latte."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,4$ for regular  house coffee. It’s not included in your brunch menu.  Food is ok but nothing out of ordinary. Not really best brunch in SFO. Service is good and fast.  Pricey. 70$ for 2.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Awesome place to eat, service is top notch, staff is super friendly. The only complaint was that the omelette had barely and cheese, and cheese is super important in an omelette in my opinion"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Really good friendly service and very tasty food. Portions on the big side. We ate here twice, we enjoyed it so much. The bloody Mary's are well worth a look"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"We found this little place on our first morning in San Francisco and loved it so much we went back for breakfast the next day too! It's a cozy, clean, friendly little cafe filled with interesting local art and great food. It's also located near the beginning of one of the cable car routes where you can buy daily passport (recommend and worth it). We paid around $25 for a very filling breakfast for two."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"No joke, but the bagels tasted like they were from Safeway or Trader Joe’s. Upon further inspection of walking down the street to Walgreens, I think they came from here, because the bagels look legit identical.  This place is a tourist trap"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,I used to rate this place 5 stars. Prices have gone way up (like every where else) portions have gotten smaller as well. Now only one piece of toast comes with your omelette. Food is still good thankfully.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"What a hidden gem of a breakfast spot in the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Fran! Lots of variety, from breakfast classics to original more-adventurous dishes, and a very friendly staff! The breakfast burrito with sweet potato hash was amazing (and huge)! There is indoor and outdoor seating, and, as an added bonus, the walls are covered with local artwork (most of which is available for purchase). Don't hesitate to stop at this awesome family-run breakfast joint!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"My wife wanted biscuits and gravy for breakfast. She is very particular. I found Pat's Cafe online. A cute little restaurant where you can watch the cable cars pass. We were both amazed at the large portions. They far exceeded expectations. Their corned beef hash tops the charts and the biscuits and gravy made her day. The service was fast, and friendly. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Service was friendly but the food looked like it was made by someone that was learning to cook for themselves in college. For the price it is not worth it.  All the ingredients looked as if they were sourced from Ralph’s.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"We sat outside after the rain on New Years day, it was beautiful they had heaters so we stayed warm. We were offered mimosas but just wanted juice, I had the best French toast I have ever had! Our waiter was very busy but gave us more than enough of his time and made us laugh a lot.  Great place I will return when I'm in the city again."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Chilaquilles were delicious and I got 4* big strips of bacon as a side. I appreciated that. That's some generosity. No notes 👏🏼👏🏼
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Fantastic place. I went there for breakfast. Nice classic music. Friendly crew. Yummy food.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Very good food and very nice service. The place has a good location, within walking distance from every touristy place. You can see local people getting breakfast here, which is a good indicator. Highly recommended!!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The food is pretty great and the service is one of a kind. I strongly eating here. They have an awesome item selection and the service is always great here.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Verry good place for brunch!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Juice portion its to small, food tastes very good. Service could be better."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Service 5* Super friendly welcome everyone as old friends  Food: Delicious food had the omelette and honestly the sour dough bread was delicious!  Price/value: A bit pricy for breakfast but worth the stop
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Adorable neighborhood gem! Super-friendly staff and excellent food. Go for the El Ranchero for a hearty breakfast meal or Go Really Wild Waffles if you have a sweet tooth. This place is busy but will always have a spot for you, so don't waste your time standing in line at the tourist traps. We will definitely visit Pat's again."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Cute little place.  The staff was excellent. I got the breakfast burrito with sausage Egg and it had Black beans Etc. It was really good.  And it came with avocado sour cream  and little cute potatoes.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Gor seated party of 4 during busy morning right away. Waiter came by and was very attentive. Food was good and service was great.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Food was hot and was well seasoned. We were impressed with the flavor of the sausage gravy. Burger was well done and not dry. Waiter was very polite, tipped well. Would come back."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Great slightly out-of-the-way cafe that is a real gem and worth seeking out. We had an amazing lunch served well in a nice clean café.  If you are in the area definitely worth seeking out.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,This place has the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. Their hollandaise sauce is so good. Small area but very colorful and cute. Didn't have to wait for a table and service was great. Waiter was very nice and patient. Adorable outside store front and the other food was great too.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Worth a stop if you are in the city.  Great breakfast and lunch menu.  We left satisfied after generous portions.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"This spot was a hit for my entire family of 5.  Some of us even ordered seconds 😉 the eggs Benedict, pancakes, Nutella crepes and waffles were winners and the home fries were loved by all."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Solid french toast and they offer real maple syrup! Chicken sausages were good. Very good and fast service. Wish the portions were bigger
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"The best Benny I've ever had!! Do not miss a chance to try their cloud-like pancakes and delicious cappuccino, all delivered with spectacular service!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Great place! Tiny kitchen kept up with the busy brunch rush. Staff was friendly and efficient. I had the pancake special. Fluffy cake, egg was nice and fluffy. My companion had the Polk Street omelet. Well cooked, lots of veggies. The room is cozy and welcoming. Thanks!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Uber kid friendly place.  I mean UBER. Food is nothing to write home about. Hard working staff but what do you expect when it’s one of the few places open before 8AM?
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Very busy cafe, a little bit of a wait. I ordered crab cake Benedict. It was ok but the crab cake wasn't that great. The eggs and hollandaise sauce was nice. There were a lot of potatoes and was a bit too filling. The chai latte was really sweet and I couldn't finish it. Service was quick and was fine."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Far from dennys quality! Staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, not one thing to complain about & their coffee, amazing!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Great little place. Delicious breakfast. We had the Mexican omlette and California omlette.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The breakfast here is pretty great and the service is always friendly. They have a great menu selection and their prices are reasonable.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,We were looking for a non-touristy brunch restaurant not too far from Pier 39 and lombard street. This place was perfect. The food was very good and prices were fair (16 and 18$). I recommend
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Service, menu, and flavors were top notch. Also highly recommend the soju Bloody Mary. We went for breakfast and it is one of our favorite spots in SF so far!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Excellent little spot for breakfast. Crab cake Benedict was my wife’s highlight. Home fries were also delicious. Service was super friendly, food was fast, and coffee refilled quickly. Make the quick walk!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Delicious and they greeted us in the most welcoming way. Highly recommend it!
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The food is average and breakfast is pricey (but it is San Francisco!). The service was great and friendly.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,I went two times this week to have breakfast before work and the first time I was told that they will be ready in one hour so 8:30 a.m. The second time we were three people outside waiting patiently at 7:35 a.m. while the person inside keep ignoring us. The company has to update your business hours and improve the customer satisfaction. I am ISO 9001  leader so I know about quality :).
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"We would eat there again to be sure, just had to reacquaint ourselves with the costs involved... I had a yummy omelet, grandma had pancakes, son had steak fajitas....yummy!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Best place in San Francisco for breakfast. Everything on the menu is great. My personal favs are the breakfast burrito, California omelette and pancakes."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,Staff were friendly and welcoming. Lovely feel to the place. A genuine experience at a small and friendly cafe.
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Delicious meal, however a bit expensive.  Just enough food on the plate. Pancakes were great!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"Came here Monday morning, and there was a short wait. This place does not do substitutions, but there's no need to! Lots of different breakfast options, there's something for everyone. This is a heavy breakfast spot, and close to Lombard street, so stop by here and walk it off after!"
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,"The staff was great however the food was cold when it got to the table. Other than that, it was a great experience."
Pat's Cafe,2330 Taylor St,The food was great and the service too! It is a small restaurant and felt a bit crammed during the time I went for breakfast. No open spaces as the tables are close to each other. I guess the more the merrier. If you don't mind the limited space then this restaurant is great for quality food. Eggs Benedict was delicious!
