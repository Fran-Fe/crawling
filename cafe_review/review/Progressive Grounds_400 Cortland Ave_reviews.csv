Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Lovely vibes, returned twice during my stay in the area. Staff are always nice and the food is great! Recommend the lunch set with tomato soup and sandwich, it’s a good portion lovely for a cool day. The caramel latte is one of the best i’ve ever had."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,We got a tuna melt wrap and a grilled salmon wrap to go. The tuna melt was decent but it would've been nice to include some vegetables. The salmon wrap had a good amount of salmon but it was quite fishy. I like that they were able to have the sauce on the side because it would've made the wrap soggy. I also got an almond latte since somebody mentioned that it was the best one they've had. I found it mediocre at best. The amount of food was more than filling but quality and taste can be improved.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Best coffee shop in Bernal Heights! Vegan and vegetarian options, everything fresh and made to order. The staff including the owner Marco are warm and welcoming! The patio is a highlight for outdoor eating. 10/10"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Had a nice LARGE coffee for the same price other coffees only have a smaller size. The chicken salad beagle was AMAZING! It kept me full for several hours! The service was great! Very nice place to chill
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,It has such a nice and warm vibe for a coffee place. Other items on the menu are also very good such as their pesto wrap and bagels. The people are quite friendly and welcome you with open arms. I would say the best experience to have is to eat at the patio with a great and homely feel. A must go for San Franciscans and newcomers alike.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Ordered the Blue suede shoes “blueberry” smoothie was simple yet delicious. Also ordered a grilled ChZ with egg (bcuz they don’t start serving Lavash until 10:30 am) but the sandwich was not at all what I had expected ! The bread was chewy and the egg didn’t run like I had hoped. All this for $20 tip included. It’s a small Moroccan inspired coffee shop on Cortland Ave. Two person staff and it can get busy so be patient. Yet a Friendly environment and not much for seating in the front as the back wasn’t opened up.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"The owners and the staff are always in a good mood. The cafe is huge. The back patio is lovely and there is plenty of room to gather in the front and the back spaces.  The food is diverse and absolutely yummy with big portions. And of course, the organic coffee is a must."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Nice vibe. Went on a Saturday when a Chess club was going on in the back of cafe. My son played with other players there while we sipped our coffees. Coffee & staff was good!!!
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"A great cafe in a great neighborhood, food is always fresh and tasty snd the service always great, courteous. My favourites are the Greek salad and the quesadillas for my son (made with flat bread and mozzarella) if you are in Bernal pay them a visit!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"This place has a nice chill laid-back vibe, with such beautiful and colorful seating arrangements, and the food is really great too.  ❤️ Grilled veggie wrap was superb. I generally find veggie wraps very dry and lacking in flavor but not this one, they really surprised me and I loved everything about this grilled veggie wrap 😀 Iced chai tea latte was a surprise too. I generally find chai tea lattes very dull and plain because I am used to really strong flavored Indian home made chai but I was surprised that I finally found a chai tea latte that I really liked. Maybe the secret is to buy a cold chai tea latte and not a hot one but anyways definitely a must try for all those who can't have coffee for some or the other reason like me. You will not be disappointed.  My friend also loved her falafel wrap."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Great shop for working on your computer. Nice cushions, atmosphere and patio. Food was decent, nothing special. Crab soup was very liquid."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,One of the best local coffee shops in Bernal Heights. Super nice staff and incredible sandwiches. Great spot to work and study since they have pretty big seating area indoor and in the backyard
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,One of the best Chai Lattes I've ever had. We also got croissant sandwiches that were excellent. Friendly service made our visit from Michigan just delightful.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,The WORST MATCHA LATTE EVER!! Match is clumped up. You are paying $6.50 for a cup of milk! If you do not know how to make a matcha latte do not say you can make it smh.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Fantastic spot to spend an afternoon. The customer service is amazing. Food was great and the coffee even better. The environment was inviting and extremely comfortable. I will return to this amazing little shop any chance I get.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Great coffee shop with food and indoor seating,  which seems to be harder to find in SF since covid. Even better, open until 6pm. Oh and it has ice cream"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Coffee & service were both excellent
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Really great spot to grab drinks/food and chill. They have lots of seating space and great vibes.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Love this place! Their coffee is great! It's  also nice to drink and relax and browse the internet via their available Wi-Fi. Also, it's a nice spot to socialize."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Food and coffee are mostly alright- iced coffee tastes bitter and maybe a little burned. Mostly I love this place for the atmosphere. Very cozy, I could work here all day. Service is really friendly too. FYI, the outdoor patio they used to have has been closed for months and months, shows no sign of reopening."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Nice shop, decent coffee, decent ice cream. Nice neighborhood feel to the place. I have not tried any of the food."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"My favorite coffeeshop, around Bernal Heights and the entire San Francisco. When I need to work during the weekend, and I don't feel like exploring, this is my go-to place.  If you go there for a breakfast, try the croissants or the large oatmeal. If you go there for lunch, try the lunch combo (soup + sandwich; tell them to customize the sandwich if you feel like or want to make it vegetarian) or one of the lavash wraps. If you just hang around, you can try out a smoothie (the blue-soled shoes is my favorite) and one of their numerous cookies, some of them even semi-healthy. Or just grab a scoop of ice-cream as many weekend passers-by do.  If you go there to work, order and then head to the room at the back of the coffeeshop. It has a Moroccan-inspired decor, including a sea of colorful, comfy pillows. The room has a plethora of power outlets, and the wifi is pretty good - during the weekend, you will be one of the many who study or work there.  They also have a backyard, though it has been under reconstruction since I had moved here. Stay tuned, the space looks lovely! Finally, the staff is amazing and regular - they will know you by name soon. In short, this place is a hidden gem. If you live around the Bernal Heights and coffeeshops are your thing, definitely check Progressive Grounds out."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,We had breakfasts at this place for three days while staying in SF. We tried a few different bagels and sandwiches and everything was delicious! The staff is nice and the owner is an amiable person and he likes to have a chat with customers. I also loved the atmosphere inside - pretty paintings on the walls and jazz music played in the background. Will go there again when I'm back in SF!
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Best coffee shop in Bernal! Great patio in the back. You can go play chess on Mondays or grab a beer and watch the World Cup when it's on. Best almond flavor lattes in town!
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,The perfect place to enjoy a cup of organic joe
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Great place to work with good WiFi and low volume music. More importantly really good espresso and coffee options, breakfast and lunch  sandwiches, bagels, pastries, and ice cream!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,I met my friends here for coffee.  There 2 two rooms and a courtyard of seatings. You order at the counter and wait for your coffee / drink to be prepared. They have a variety of pastries and sandwiches for a quick bite. What I like about the back room is there was plenty of outlets. Many people get a cup of coffee and then they're working on their laptops so the back room is pretty quiet.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Great affordable menu, friendly staff, great outdoor seating."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Cute coffee shop with good food options. There are a lot of electrical plugs along the wall for those working in their computers. The batista was very helpful and even made a drink for me not in their drink menu. The bathrooms were very clean as well. Highly recommend this cute coffee shop.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Old school cafe. Nice atmosphere, decent lunch options, rediculously slow service (waited 15 min for take away wrap). Rank coffee. Cup of tea, a better option. WiFi."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"The music in this neighborhood cafe is always good! It’s a tidy and nicely furnished spot with a great view in front and a pleasant garden in the back. The staff is great. The food is tasty and the portions are generous. I like the wraps and the breakfast sandwiches. I like starting my morning out here with a hot cup of organic coffee and looking out of the window, watching the day unfold."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,All you could want from great breakfast. The orange juice is some of the best I've ever had!
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,NO LAPTOP ON THE WEEKENDS so if you’re looking for a place to work/study on the weekend this is not the place. Staff is cool and food is good.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Always a nice place to hang but food could be tastier
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Love this coffee shop!  Three areas to eat,  front with great music,  back which is quieter for working (lots of outlets), and nice patio. Food options are plentiful,  including gluten free options.  Great smoothies. Very friendly and experienced staff."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Such an awesome place! I looked it because I needed a place to meet someone, and I couldn't have picked better. The person I was meeting was late, but I was honestly glad because it meant I could enjoy the incredible atmosphere they've managed to create here. While I drank my ice mocha I got to see the barista have a conversation with one of his regulars. These are the kind of things that make a place feel welcoming and we need a lot more of it these days. I will be returning, and raving about it to my friends."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,The ham & cheese croissant was delish! Perfect with the dijon.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Nice for work, have a decent wifi and double latte was good😊👍🏻 …"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,The might have a newly renovated space but they are still serving the good ol coffee and uplifting food. Definitely a good space for catch up or quiet time.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"I was looking for a place to get some work done in Bernal heights and there is no shortage of those here. Its like a scene from pleasantville when you pop over to Bernal Heights and Progressive Grounds fits right into that homey atmosphere.  The staff was really nice upon entering. You can tell they have a lot of locals and repeat customers which is a good sign of a quality establishment. I didn't order coffee but I did try to Croque Monsuier. It was excellent. The bechamel sauce was doused all over the sandwich and i couldn't stop eating it.  They have a large menu of breakfast items. They also have a lot of wraps and sandwiches as well so you can stop by anytime a grab a meal.  The other part that make Progressive wonderful is its seating and wifi. They have a really strong wifi service and plenty of seating for everyone to work. They have a back patio area that is completely separate from the entrance and ordering area. This is really good to help from getting distracted. Most places wouldn't trust you in a place with wifi to just sit and work but they were so chill here.  You can actually come and get hours of work done and if you buy something no one will bother you. I also noticed the place is really pet and family friendly. Seriously i have never seen so many people come in with a baby stroller or toddler in a two hour sitting.  This place is exactly what you want in a internet cafe. Good food, great internet and plenty of space and plugs to work long hours. Come here to write the next great American novel! Or just grab a coffee. Whichever comes first."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,One of my favorite spots for coffee and for light lunch. I especially love the outdoor patio. On colder days I enjoy the cozy room in the back.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Excellent service, been going for 5 years, staff are always friendly and treat you like a friend. Food and drink have a wide selection and good quality. It is a bit expensive for what you get but reasonable considering neighborhood and city. They also have a back lounge, and a outdoor space in the back. Great for a quick bite to eat, or lunch with a friend!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"This is my new go-to spot for coffee in Bernal Highs. Definitely another cool coffee shop, with typical pastries, but nonetheless delicious and high quality. They offer various options and every time I walk in, they're busy with people but in the best way possible! The customers are always friendly, and the employees return the joy."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Great Patio to hang out on a sunny day with awesome service and delicious coffee! I'd recommend it if you want a quiet place to study or read (with headphones in)
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Locally owned with a very decent menu of breakfast and lunch choices with an international air. Prices are very reasonable and the seating area, especially in the back room is very welcoming.  They used to allow customers to access the back patio, but alas, this is now closed due to the lack of wheelchair access.  There's a fireplace in the shop which is welcoming on wet dreary days."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Great local coffee shop on Bernal Heights' main drag, Cortland Ave. Besides the main area in the front, there's a large room in the back that's really conducive to working. It's quiet, comfortable, and has a decent number of tables and outlets. There's also a gem of a patio in the very back. When the weather's nice (which it almost always is), it's a pretty and peaceful place to hang out. The coffee is great and so is the food."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"One of the best coffee shops I've found to work at. Lots of tables, chairs, outlets, and a beautiful (weather permitting) outdoor patio. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food and drinks here are a bit more expensive compared to nearby places."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Never noticed it on the posted menu, but be sure to stop by on the weekend at mid-morning and get the banana cake. It’ll be warm then and is delicious! Pairs well with any of their coffee drinks. My wife and I have almost made this a tradition!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"I live 2 blocks away so can't beat the convenience of this place. I've studied for many a final in the cozy back room and had fun with friends in the back patio during nice weather as well. The wraps are great, especially the salmon/spinach one. The staff are nice, the guy that's usually at the register almost always brings up a topic of conversation whether it be the logo on my shirt or the laptop in my hand. The drinks and food are good here, everything is just a little more expensive than most cafe's though. Martha's down the street is nearly a dollar cheaper for most beverages. Progressive was perfect before recent price increases but I will still go there because it's a very cool atmosphere."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Wonderful little coffee shop recommended to us by our Airbnb host who lives is Bernal Heights. We came here for breakfast and morning coffee. The bagels with eggs were SO DELICIOUS! I want to know how to get my eggs that fluffy at home. Our coffee was amazing too. We came in before a crowd and ended up waiting about 10-15 mins for our food while the rush came in. Kinda disappointing. Other than some slow service, the place is great with wonderfully nice staff."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Progressive Grounds is nice neighborhood coffee plus shop. You can sit inside or go to the patio. The shop is set up for those with electronic devices, extra plugs everywhere.  Staff is very efficient and friendly.  Bathroom is unisex. Shop is easily accessed by wheelchair."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Free WiFi, an excellent selection of delicious pasties and sandwiches, and a very friendly staff.  The only coffee house you ever need to visit while living in, or visiting San Francisco.  I frequent this establishment EVERY day.  The Moroccan influence in the decor is one of my favorite attributes."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,WARNING: THE HOURS ARE WRONG! They close at 6 pm not 8 pm. Still giving 5 stars cuz it’s the best cafe in the city IMO with great food. But trying to save others the pain I went through of ubering here from far away just to find out it’s closing. I suggested an edit on the hours to Google but I don’t know if it will take.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Progressive Grounds Cafe was super delightful. My partner and I really enjoyed the open atmosphere while I was there. The Bagels were V Good and tasted phenomenal. I really appreciated the service as well. They worked really effectively and efficiently to fulfill and get orders out. They are also located in a great location. They are located in Bernal Heights near Holly Park. It's a small city feeling with bug city outraspeck. The only reason I gave this review 4 stars is because of the Chai. It was as tastefull as I thought. I am sure that the other options of coffee was great considering the recent reviews. I wouldnt recommend chai if you go here. Overall amazing. Highly recommend.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Ordered a dirty soy chai and ginger lemonade, loved the drinks and the ambiance! Sat for a bit and saw all the lovely dishes come out of the kitchen - excited to come back and try some!!!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Nice outdoor space coffee was good. I chose my pastry poorly it was pretty stale. It's got some of the  90's SF coffee house vibe minus the graffiti and slackers.  I'd definitely go again.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"This coffee shop has an excellent vibe and quirky/unique decor. The menu is quite a mix of sandwiches and coffee but the bottom line is that with amble seating and a nice atmosphere, it is the perfect place to spend a few hours for work or leisure."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Cute cafe in Bernal Height. Good breakfast and lunch menu.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Pleasant staff and clean facilities.   There is a backyard seating area. Unfortunately, what used to seat 20+ now seats 6 if no one shares tables.  Its a nice spot in a quaint SF neighborhood."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Nice cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. I found the coffee and food to be just average though. Great place to get some work done!
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Edited review: after coming here a handful of times, I find the coffee and food quality to be too inconsistent. They do not train new staff well, and some of them are incapable of making something as simple as a bagel and cream cheese. I still like the atmosphere, but burnt coffee ruins my day!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"My husband and I have been daily customers for many years.  We love this very Bernal neighborhood cafe.  On week-ends we settle in with our latte and coffee, croissant (delicious from a French bakery) and blueberry muffin to read our Saturday and Sunday newspapers.  On weekday mornings we take our coffees out.  We recommend Aziz and his staff highly.  They remember the repeat orders of regular customers and welcome visitors.  We enjoy the warm, cozy atmosphere, good food, and friendly greetings from Aziz and his crew. Mary and Terry"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,great food and coffee drinks.   a comfortable and quiet place to work.   plenty of seating and tables in the back with ample power outlets. this is my favorite place to stop when I want a coffee and need to get work done. I just wish they were open a little later.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Lovely quiet place to get work done with okay wifi. Amazing staff. Tasty gluten free bagels.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Cozy small neighborhood cafe tucked in Bernal Heights. Enjoyed the croque monsieur. They also have a great selection of baked goods. The coconut macaroon was a nice treat. Warm & friendly staff. There is more seating in the back.
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"It's very, very loud in here on weekends. I've been coming every Sunday during the World Cup, and you might as well forget about getting anything done during matches. It has more of a sports bar feel during big sporting events; people are cheering and yelling, and the TV is at high volume. There is a decent-sized back room down the hallway and some outdoor seating beyond that. However, the noise from the louder front room is still very audible, and the people in the back seem to make a bunch of phone calls, study in groups, and let their kids run wild. To top this craziness off, the door to the outdoor section doesn't completely close. It's constantly opening and closing with the wind. It's usually pretty chilly around here, and the chill that keeps coming in combined with the loud noise of the door slamming is extremely annoying.  The coffee is good. Plenty of good food options, and they have gluten-free bagels and breakfast snacks.  It's much quieter on weekdays, naturally.  tl;dr: It's so freaking loud in here, especially on weekends. Not like a normal coffee shop. However, the coffee and food options are great."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Great wraps! We saw some people eating some delicious looking wraps while walking on Cortland, and it turned out they were from here. We came buy later and had the Kefa a Lindienne and Chicken Toscana wraps. Both were excellent, though we liked the Chicken Toscana a bit more. And there is a nice patio in the back. Great neighborhood find!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Super friendly staff who are fast with drinks and food! I’ve had smoothies, breakfast and sandwiches everything always tastes great! Also, it’s a really cool place to hang out!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"My favorite cafe in Bernal Heights by far.  The food and coffee are both solid (though there is better out there), with a good range of pastries and healthier fare.  There are three distinct spaces to suit all needs: a sunny front room, a reserved rear room with carpets and cushions abound, and a lovely back patio. The internet is reliable and around 10 Mbps/up/down, and there are ample power outlets everywhere except for the back patio."
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Love this place! Friendly staff, comfortable environment, healthy and delicious food offered on the large menu. And oh, the patio, what a great addition!"
Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,Best home made banana bred.

Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Coffee was delicious, and the ambiance was perfect. The seating in the back is comfy and convenient, and the patio is lovely. I'll be spending a lot more time here!"

Progressive Grounds,400 Cortland Ave,"Absolutely awesome spot to be and dine at. If you are visiting San Fran, its a must-see. Much love for Patron, who was super friendly and had real story to share."
