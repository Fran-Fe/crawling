Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Craving some coffee as a pick-me-up on a Sunday late afternoon, and found this cafe in the neighborhood. I like that it offers both indoor and outdoor seating, and it's dog-friendly. Ordered a small cup of cappuccino with oak milk to go, and waited a little bit while sitting at one of the outdoor tables. After having the first sip of my espresso drink, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it tastes. The coffee beans were mildly roasted, and the drink has an amazing depth of flavor, combined with the velvety texture of the frothed oak milk. Such a delight for my afternoon."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Yummy place for a breakfast & a good coffee! Loved the style and the food was super delicious! Big recommendation. Nice service!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I’m visiting my sister here in SF, and we decided to make a quick lunch break at Cafe Rèveille. Super friendly staff, lively location, chill music playing, and super delicious food! The falafel bowl was simply satisfying, with complex flavors and textures. A bit on the spicy side, so be sure to order an herbal ice tea! My sis had the burger that was world class. I’ll return once more."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Don’t miss their homemade orange jam, super delicious! Comfortable environment with appetizing food and affable people!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Got brunch with a friend, food was delicious. Had a sandwich and coffee. Outdoor seating was very nice. My friend got a bowl and was also very healthy and delicious. It came up to be around $23 USD each after tip and tax."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"We had a great breakfast at Reveille. The breakfast sandwich was superb. poppy seeds on the bread and the melted cheese they used on the sandwich really made the difference. My partner had a breakfast bowl and rated it 9/10. We came on a Sunday, it was busy but we got a table inside with no wait. The outdoor seating is very cool but it might take you a while to get a table during the weekend."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Lovely brunch and coffee spot. We tried the breakfast sandwich, the açai bowl and the shakshuka. Everything was super tasty and served promptly. Defo will be back again soon!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Really cute café and coffee shop on a nice urban residential corner. Lots of tasty and healthy food and drink options, particularly for breakfast, lunch, or a snack, including a variety of sandwiches, salads, bowls, and pastries. Lovely outdoor seating area great for watching people and pups, given its proximity to Duboce Park. This place is very popular and often busy with a line, especially on weekend mornings and midday. Friendly staff and fairly fast service, considering how busy they usually are."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Oh my goodness get ready to eat the best breakfast sandwich ever! The bread was toasted but not too much, the bacon was thick and delicious & the eggs with cheese just melted in my mouth. I especially loved the double roasted almonds croissant 🥐 bread with a delicious cup of hot coffee YUM 😋. I could not have asked for a better breakfast. I just hope you #enjoy it as much as I did. It’s definitely worth the calories and some! I’m giving it a 3.5 because the servers could be a little bit more attentive but it is early in the morning and it can’t be easy taking care of so many people. Regardless it’s not going to disappoint you ❤️💕. Enjoy!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Went here with my boyfriend today for breakfast. We ordered a breakfast sandwhich - loaded and a breakfast platter. The food was good and got to us pretty fast. We sat outside because we wanted to watch the people on the wiggle and we also liked that there were heaters.  What left a lot to be desired was the pricing and counter service.  6 dollars for tea (no refills), Coffee was 4 dollars (refills included).  The woman who took our order at the counter kept giving us attitude when we'd ask a question about an item on the menu."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Cool brunch spot. Seats open up relatively quickly even with a line. Food is good. Wish they had more egg options (only poached eggs). Also the iced coffee is just so so, kind of bitter."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Great place for a coffee in a heart of north beach. I really like the ambiance and location. Coffee was awesome as well. They are a bit expensive then any other coffee shop. They have nice and clean restrooms which are kinda hard to find in sf 🤣. Check them out if you are in the area
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Really cute coffee shop in an adorable corner of Duboce triangle. I've had the matcha and cortado, both delicious. Also a great place to sit outside with your dog, and later take them to run at Duboce park!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Lovely coffee place with beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. Tables outside are in shade and have heaters above.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Nice cafe with good wifi.  But I don't think there are outlets. They have variety of food. Good vibe and open until 730 pm too. Cute park and dogs nearby, and restaurants around if you want to get dinner somewhere else after."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Great place to come and enjoy the taste of your coffee and a book. My friend recommended it and said there breakfast burrito are the best in town. Have to try this still.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Super friendly crew n with great chicken sandwich, they menu is not that big but good for a cafe. Also you can enjoy outside ."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Tahini squash bowl was out of this world. So delicious. I’ll keep dreaming of having it again. My husband had the breakfast sandwich, which he enjoyed. Potatoes were good but could have used more seasoning. We could not get a table outside though and there is no indoor seating so we had to eat in our car."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Staff are very friendly and helpful. I ate açai bowl and croissant. Açai bowl was very nice. It's nice to open early.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great coffee, good wifi. Perfect spot with indoor and outdoor seating for breakfast and brunch walk-ins"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"this place is a must, the location is everything! I could sit there for hours and soak up the best ambiance in town. the food is delicious, the staff is helpful and attentive, the area is gorgeous surrounded by cute parks and beautiful houses and scenery. I’ve been going to the city for years and I fell in love with this spot the first time I went there 10/10"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Lovely place with a cozy modern aesthetic. The chicken sandwich was flavorful, tender, and light. So so good! The staff were friendly as well :)"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Delicious Breakfast Bowl and Chai Latte, my bill was $25. It was crowded and they don’t have outlets for electric connection, so I don’t recommend it for working at the computer."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Cute little coffeeshop, good food and coffee and friendly staff. The process for picking up your coffee from the bar could be improved, there were just a bunch of unlabeled cups and people kept walking off with each other's coffees and the barista wasn't calling out names."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"three star for the food. might be deceived by long weekend lines.  the espresso quality, which used to be better (i was a regular), has dropped significantly. and the attitude of the employee is as full as themselves as they can be (mostly a group of white hipsta's, except the kitchen, which is gonna be people of color obviously 💁), with barely ever a smile on a face. highly recommend La Cafe Du Soleil, with a descent coffee, and super-sweet attitude, in 2 mins distance  i left Reveille never to go back after they didn't clean up the table i sat at after 20 minutes  p.s. for the curious, person of color myself"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"A great neighborhood spot for decent coffee and food. I recommend the breakfast sandwich with the works - classic bacon egg cheese on a poppy bun with avo, hot sauce and arugula. They have a nice parklet with heaters for outdoor seating but you need to come early to get a spot and there is usually a long queue (even for takeout) at peak times."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Very nice local location! Good breakfast but the consistency of the coconut bowl was too « ice-cream-like » for me. But very tasty 😋
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Amongst the best cafes in the city, highly consistent quality of food, very polite service in a great area."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Cute spot in Lower Haight with great outdoor seating. I will say some things here are great, some are a swing and a miss. Great: Falafel bowl - seriously so delicious! The fresh veggies, the avocado, the falafel, the dressing! So good. Must order! Lattes - Devine! Gluten free labeled menus - so nice!  Swing and a miss: Hot chocolate - tasted like I was just drinking milk, no chocolate Chai latte - tasted like I was drinking out of a spice jar mixed with water instead of milk"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Good food and great coffee. Had the burrito bowl, spicy but quite good! Maybe just needed some salt is that bad to say? Mate had the burrito and it looked bomb."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"favorite cafe. the best coffee around, excellent customer service. though as typical a bit pricey, worth it for sure."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"This was the first time I've been to this cafe. At first I was not sure if it would be a great place because of the restaurants around it but once we turned the corner we were surprised how many people and places to sit down there was. Even though there wasn't many options for big meals since it was a brunch place, their breakfast sandwich + ""the works"" add on is the best! Loving the mix of arugula and egg with a hint of spice. Definitely coming back"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,If the service was better I could give this place more stars but the staff was sullen with low energy and not friendly at all. We were super early coming in almost as soon as they opened but It would have been nice to feel like they were happy to see us. On the positive side my husband enjoyed his food and I liked mine as well!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Salad was surprisingly good - fresh, tasty, plentiful and unique. Their chicken sandwich was delish too, slaw and sauce were something special (though kinda spicy). A cafe well worth checking out for its dishes which you can't get anywhere else. Coffee was not bad but did not wow."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Very cute place with excellent coffee and great food. Ask for the Açai bowl - they can even prepare a vegan version without the bee pollen and the granola (honey). Super fresh and delicious.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Surprisingly good food but the coffee was not so great. I had the breakfast with eggs bacon and potatoes. Those potato's were so deliciously crispy, I couldn't give my bacon the attention it deserved."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,That one male cashier Really if you want this business to grow people like him can't work there. The food is great I love that coffee.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Modern decor, friendly and efficient service, fast casual cafe with a selection of tasty healthy dishes. Loved it!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Super hip spot for coffee and food! Breakfast bowels are delicious and coffee is yummy. Trendy crowd with a chill vibe. Nice location near Duboce Park.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Amazing bakery items - must try the bacon scone 😻😻😻 excellent coffee and friendly services. A lot of comfortable seating and great energy! …
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great food, nice setting, it’s a pity they don’t have power outlets.."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Loved every aspect of this restaurant! Service, food, ambiance 10/10.  If you love to try loads of different flavours and ingredients in one dish order the breakfast bowl!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Cute place with great coffee. Acai bowl is great with fresh fruit and ice cream at the bottom.  I ordered seasame burger, but they gave me burger... So sad."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Great place and service.. I loved the area.  Best latte ever!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"My favorite spot in Duboce Triangle! Great food and drinks, outdoor seats with heatings!! 🥰 my dog loves it too. …"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,I was there an hour ago and ordered an almond croissant and tipped $1.00. I get home and I have a muffin in my bag?  I don't like muffins. It is too far to walk back to exchange the muffin for what I ordered.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Excellent coffee, cute space. Friendly and fast service. I'm looking forward to trying to food!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Food was amazing, atmosphere is a nothing to write home about."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Healthy green super tasty choices Nice corner to work or to chill… loved it!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Great coffee and food! Healthy food options and great outdoor patio seating.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Delicious breakfast sandwich.  Excellent cappuccino!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Love Réveille’s coffee, croissants, and salads! A quick walk if you’re visiting Alamo Square!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Great place at the Height’s-Hayes area. If you want to share among friends a great cup of coffe beyond noisy Height St get this cozy spot a couple streets down at Waller St and Steiner St. Tip: just in the opposite corner is placed a public ‘tiny library’ (actually a cabin) for those empty schedule windows or just for fun.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I walked up on a slightly drizzly day. The line to order moved fairly quickly. The lady behind the counter was really sweet and efficient in taking my order. Where I take a star is I literally waited 20 mins for a breakfast bowl to come out. From what I understand they usually have a high volume of online orders. My best suggestion is order before you go and hopefully time it so that your food is ready when you arrive. The breakfast bowl was all I hoped for. One of the few filling, healthy options in the area."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,The BBAA was really good. The black americano though not great for my taste. Great location and ambiance.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I’ve passed by Cafe Reveille so many times and finally went in! Pastries are great, coffee is great, outdoor seating is so welcoming. What more can you ask from a coffee shop? Hoping to come back!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Lots of very healthy options and delicious coffee/drinks. Great for lunch or dinner.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,I should sue for psychological injury. I mean the emptiness I felt after I finished the espresso and the last of it vanished from my taste buds.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,First time there and the food was great!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"CAFE reveille is a little off the beaten path and on a nice leafy street. There is plenty of outdoor seating and service is efficient and the coffee is good. (The cappuccino was beautiful.)  However! I found the almond croissant I had sub par. It was cold, flattened and doughy, not the flaky buttery pastry that I would expect from somewhere that revels in their french roots, especially at these prices. The Cafe itself doesn’t give me a warm fuzzy feeling but is a good option if you want a quiet coffee and to people watch."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Super salad bowls. Service is basically someone bringing your order to the table.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Very good There are some Chocolatine like France A cool Breakfast at ""Café Réveille""👍 …"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I got only a coffee there but it wasn’t the best, it had a burnt coffee taste."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I just came here with my friends and all of us were absolutely floored with how good the food was. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with “the works” and it was probably the best breakfast sandwich I’ve ever had. I also got the golden potatoes and would say the same thing about them too. Also for SF, I thought the prices were very reasonable. Nestled in a quiet neighborhood, I couldn’t recommend this gem more."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,A great option for an indoor cafe in SF. The food is very reasonably priced and tastes great. Good selection too. There's lots of seating.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great neighborhood cafe for coffee, breakfast and lunch. I've been delighted each time I've tried a new item on the menu. The shakshuka, breakfast burrito and fish sandwich are all really delicious!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Their potatoes are amazing. They pull consistently good shots of espresso. And their food is excellent as well. Try the breakfast bowl for something healthy, or the breakfast burrito for something more indulgent. Also of note: the chocolate kouign amann from a local bakery."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I discovered this place during covid so perhaps this business has seen better days. The place is cool to grab your laptop and work there with your coffee. You'll find many folks doing that, which helps to the ambience. Menu items a bit pricey and quality is below average. Staff is not the nicest either; they kind of seem bothered that you got there as a customer.  Currently you can only sit outdoors, which doesn't make sense given that all bars and restaurants hold people indoors with no mask. But I guess covid behavior never made sense."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"This coffee shop is indeed a great place to kill your time, do business, and to study as well. The coffees and hot chocolates they had was so delicious."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"This cafe is my go-to spot, I feel so fortunate to live a few blocks away and come here about once a week at least. They were a savior during restricted pandemic times. Their food menu is great, everything is very tasty and healthy but the best item is their breakfast burrito. For me it is the crispy potatoes IN the burrito. My only request is that they prioritize the crispy potato in this burrito, occasionally they are not crispy but when they are it is legit the best breakfast burrito ever! Coffee, matcha and chai is super tasty too. The outdoor expansion was such a good move, it is so nice to sit outside there and watch the world go by (and they have heaters for those inevitably nippy SF days)"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,So good I accidentally ate almost all of it before she got back from the bathroom. RIP me
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Coffee is very good. Espresso is great 👍
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Amazing food, creative and fresh ingredients, delightful presentation and friendly staff."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Food and coffee are great! however the service here is beyond slow everytime I go there and I live locally. Often in the morning a coffee can take 20 mins, which seems unreasonable when there are 3-4 people working front of house.  Sadly I've now stopped going the service is so slow. A real shame."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Worst service ever. Ordered the Homestyle Breakfast 2 eggs over easy for HERE and a latte. Quite simple right? So while I was waiting outside listening to the latest Beyoncé album (quite quite amazing btw) apparently they called my name inside… 15 minutes later a girl come to meet me outside with a TO GO box! Apparently my breakfast was inside waiting. Oh! But I ordered FOR HERE. And there is this thing they gave me with number on it to put on the table. Yeah! It says #3. So what do we do now? Sir, I’ll be back… 2 minutes later she comes back with my UNPACKED breakfast, now on a plate! Guess what? The eggs are poached! Oh I’m sorry. I didn’t order that. Well she said, this is what is on the tab… can’t do much about it. Oh, and btw where is my coffee? It’s inside… Really?!  Now I’m counting in my head. How long has it been waiting there? (I figured out 15 minutes minimum). The end result: the redid the eggs.. which came back SUNNY SIDE UP! And the rest of my plate stayed the same. Which mean I ate hot sunny side up slimy eggs with rest of a cold plate! Bravo! Funny enough. I came yesterday and everything was perfect. So I guess everyone can have a bad day. So I gave it a 2 stars. Oh and btw, there was this guy playing bad classical on a violin just beside the terrasse… terrible. This is why Beyoncé… cheers! Oh finally it’s a 1 star"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Excellent counter serve Cafe. Their brunch menu is extensive and everything looks delicious. Their service is friendly but not too involved. There is often a line, but worth the wait! There coffee is also wonderful and always made to your specifications. I've been here a few times and will continue to go, it doesn't seem to be a good place to work though. Not very many outlets and the tables are small for working. It's much better to sit and chat with friends. They also have some outdoor seating."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"The coffee was tasty as was the chilaquiles that my wife had and the homestyle breakfast that I had. Her meal was tasty and well balanced, and mine had smashed potatoes that were just right and delicious smoky bacon cooked perfection. The toast was good and overall it was a lovely experience. The outdoor seating felt safe and distanced for our brunch meal and we've had safe well ordering. We will be going there again."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great little neighborhood coffee shop with a third wave feel. Reveille is known for great espresso drinks, single origin coffee, and cold brew. My favorite is the food menu. The food is always innovative, fresh, healthy, and reasonably priced. The breakfast sandwich is one of the best I’ve had. Soft bread, perfectly cooked bacon, and lots of cheese.  Service is always excellent. Friendly, but not overly talkative. This location has lots of indoor and outdoor seating. Great for a work from home day, coffee with a friend, or casual lunch."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"It’s the perfect neighborhood cafe - tree lined street corner and a nice outdoor area with dogs passing by. Feels like Europe. The service at this location has always been excellent and the coffee is consistently good. I come here often early morning as it’s the only good place that is open at 7am. Between this is place and Duboce Park Cafe, Reveille each time."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"For a cafe they have pretty bad coffee, luke warm cappuccinos and slow service. Their food is good though, especially the breakfast burrito. For coffee and locally owned spots, Soleil and international are close and better picks."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I love going here for brunch, they have great vegetarian options and my favorites are the Açaí Bowl and the Breakfast Burrito with avocado."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"great location and food is tasty, however service is usually slow, and some of the servers are rude. one of the baristas basically rolled his eyes when i ordered. definitely not what you want from a local coffee place."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Pros: Great food (vegan and vegetarian options exist), decent coffee. Nice outdoor seating with overhead heaters.  Cons: all food is packed to-go, but there are only trash bins there. No option to recycle or compost if you eat at the cafe's outdoor seating."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Food and coffee are DELICIOUS! Service is SLOOOOOWWWW!!  In line you order and its 25 min until you get your food even if only 2 or 3 people are in front of you.  If you pre-order you still wait for your drink to be done which can take a while.  Coffee shops needs to be hustling usually people want their morning breakfast fast because they have to go to work
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"It's so difficult finding good coffee that tastes as good with oatmilk, and honestly Reveille is the best!  Their oatmilk latte, oatmilk cappucino and iced oatmilk latte are amazing offerings, and I highly recommend them!  I really wish they offered some kind of gluten free bread or gluten free bakery item, because then they'd be perfect!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Awesome staff, great food, nice location & low key vibes. Good vegan/vegetarian options & can veganize most non-vegan menu items. Overall great brunch spot."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"im here like once a week. amazing açaí, good matcha latte, meh breakfast burrito, bad chai latte, outdoor ambiance is cute ! staff is sometimes nice"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Simple, good food. Great ambience.  Good service."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Beautiful new spot that just opened on the corner of Steiner and Waller. Locally roasted top shelf coffee. Soft opening menu available now, that more menu items coming.  Beautiful light, bright interior.   Didn't try the food but the coffee is pretty good. I'll be back to this convenient location to try some of the kitchen's offerings."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Went on a busy Sunday morning and it was worth waiting in the line going out the door. Amazing bagel breakfast sandwich. Huge, decently cheap, friggen delicious. There was still seating inside, despite the big line, so make sure you take a peak if you want to dine in. Of course great coffees too, loved my latte"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Atmosphere, food, and coffee are amazing. This place is so popular though, you may be waiting over 30 minutes for your food like I did."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,One of the best quick cups of coffee around. They have pretty food and specialty drinks but I go back for their coffee every week.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Little coffee place with a modern decor.  The coffee is very tasty and they have a good food range from snacks to full dishes (they have a kitchen).  The staff is friendly and the WiFi good, so that you can work well from there.  Only negative: no power plugs. Seems to be an SF thing though."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,A really cute place with tasty breakfast options and great coffee
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I love this place!!! The food was a bit pricey, but it was worth the quality. I got an acai bowl (a bit too sweet but it was loaded with great toppings), and my friends got a salmon plate (really great quality) and a breakfast burrito (really good with tapatio). Also, I accidentally put salt in my latte, and they made me a new one. DO NOT USE THE WHITE GRAINS ON THE TABLE AS SUGAR!!! Overall, the staff was really friendly, and the food was super good!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Good coffee & breakfast. Vegan and gluten free option.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"I can’t say enough good things about this place.  They have the best system for social distancing, a bunch of outdoor seating and they are a 2 min walk to the park so it’s a perfect place to pick up food for a park meal.  The Levantine sandwich is my recommendation. The falafel is shatteringly crisp. The breakfast plate is delicious and comes with a special sauce and incredibly good potatoes. I haven’t had a meal here that I didn’t like!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Simple menu with easy dairy free options. Ordered the chia pudding and iced coffee with oat milk. First time having chia pudding and would like to try again/make at home. The apricot and date crumble on top was delicious
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Our favorite cafe in lower Haight. Secluded within a neighborhood away from heavy vehicle traffic. Great food, great coffee. Just make sure they include their spicy chimichurri in your to go order if your dish comes with it."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Cute laidback brunch spot. The breakfast bowl was hearty, healthy, and fairly delicious. The salmon was an exercise in putting together ingredients to make your own open faced sandwich with slightly tough bread. Overall nice hipster spot for something to eat (and they serve brunch late)."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"The food is good, little too expensive but that is not the main issue. Dirty tables not cleaned outside, asking them to clean was not well received, asking for forks “go inside” …"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Had a macchiato and a falafel salad — both were great. Sat outside in one of their little white tables and chairs, very relaxing."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great addition to the neighborhood. Excellent coffee and great food, though not inexpensive. Outdoor seating with heat lamps is available if you visit with your pet. They also have soft serve!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Coffee was terrible, almond milk was not good, chai beverage whatever it was ok but not interesting, mocha was 7$ and same thing bad tasting coffee. Pricing is through the roof. Understaffed, with all the cars scraping their bumpers at the corner, no idea why this place is popular."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"First of all, just want to start by saying I’ve never written a customer review for any restaurant, but I had a very negative experience that I needed to share. I went with my brother and his girlfriend. They ordered a hamburger and a breakfast bowl. I ordered an açaí bowl. Their food arrived a good 15 minutes before my food. I had to ask the waiter several times if my açaí bowl was almost ready since the people I was with almost finished their meals. When my açaí bowl arrived the waiter didn’t apologize for the long wait, and the açaí was still frozen (unlike the typical slushy format) where I actually couldn’t eat the açaí bowl. I never, never ask for a refund at restaurants but I went up to the register to ask for a refund and they refunded me for the açaí bowl (my only other purchase was a chai latte that they couldn’t even comp for the inconvenience), and they never apologized for serving me frozen food. It was honestly really disappointing. I understand that they might have been busy, and if the açaí wasn’t defrosted I would rather have had them tell me so I could order something else than try to trick me by serving me a frozen açaí bowl. But ultimately I was disappointed that no one expressed an apology for the entire experience. My brother enjoyed the hamburger for what it’s worth. But I honestly won’t ever go back to this place."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Great coffee and the burrito is amazing
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"A great spot, with good music and tasty drinks and food. Nice decor. Since the opening, I have noticed that the portion size has reduced while the prices have stayed the same... That makes for a steep bill most of the time -- otherwise I would probably spend my days there (and give an enthusiastic 5 stars because let's be honest I really like this place)."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Scone was OK, chocolate-filled crispy thing was delicious. No dine inside, tables were all busy outside (10am). Somewhat slow service."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"The cafe looks very nice but it is pretty expensive and doesn’t provide the service expected for that price: no plugs, you usually have to remind people to remove old plates from the outdoor seating tables when it’s busy. Also, if you don’t drink coffee and love matcha: don’t get too excited. I expected a $5 matcha to be made with real matcha powder but instead they used one of the premixes with tons of sugar (the matcha really doesn’t taste like matcha and is very sweet). Food is ok but not mindblowing."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"The coffee is good but it takes forever. I keep coming back in the hopes the service improves, but it’s the same experience every time. So I guess one star for them, and one for me for failing to learn."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Reveille Coffee has been around long enough for me to hit up their Columbus Ave location on my way to work. Now at this location people are more relaxed due to a neighborhood that has more houses than corporate building. What you'll get here is good service and friendly vibes along with family atmosphere. Parking can be a challenge, but if it's walkable then you should consider it. Order a cold brew prop open laptop searching for next business meet up is what I do most of the time. To the guy with plaid shirt and glasses on my left when I sat next to you. You saw my screen and said my name out loud. For what? I'm not even sure what's up with you. Idon't appreciate you doing that and its NOYB."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Really tasty soft scramble, breakfast sandwich, acai bowl, and cheeseburger. The place is adorable and there is heated outdoor seating. Minutes walk from Duboce Park making it a perfect place for dog owners."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Bad burgers and they turn off WiFi on the weekends
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"The place is clean and drinks are freshly prepared. I love the tea they make, but there are also other hot and cold drinks, as well as salads, snacks and sweets."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great coffee, of course, and the mushroom egg bowl is great for brunch. They used to have legit hashbrowns!! They only have partially fried potatoes now that aren’t as good."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Very cute, photogenic space. There's often a line out the door on weekends, but if you can get a table, it's a fun place to hang out with friends enjoying simple, very fresh, yummy food and fun music. There are a few tables outside where you can usually see a dog or two hanging out :) #dogfriendly #eatoutside #vegetarianfriendly #instagrammable"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Good coffee, but generally, lukewarm. Had to clean my own table."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Love/Hate.  Love that they have cellars of Maldon salt to sprinkle on the good food.  Shakshuka offers a big flavor punch. Excellent coffee. Don't like that it's called a cafe, but doesn't feel like a place to hang out.  It's more restaurant than cafe.  Also, does everyone have to be chirpy, 20-something hipsters having vacuous conversations? It feels like nothing important will ever be discussed there.  It's one of those death-by-iphone sort of places."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Big fan — really good coffee and kind baristas. Lovely place to sit outside and work and meet sweet puppies on their way to Duboce Park
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Nice place. The Asai bowl was so delicious, and their version for Shakshuka is very nice. The coffee was ok, nothing that good, but the atmosphere in the place is great, and the service is also very good."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,I’m pretty disappointed with this place. $4 for a cup of coffee and the lids still leak all over me on the way to work?  No WiFi on the weekend?  No plugs?  The decor is nice but otherwise this reveille is a letdown.  I’ll be going back to other coffee shop options.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Good Açai bowl. Nice coffee and amazing neighborhood 🤙 …
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Coffee is some of the best in the city but the food is alllllllways slow, regardless of how busy it is. I don’t quite get it."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"The sandwich was great, the yogurt parfait nothin special. We also had the kouign-amann and it was ok."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great spot, buzzing, full of natural light with decent breaky menu (including shakshuka) and excellent coffee. Fast service and while busy, usually space available due to fast turnover."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"nice little cafe with sweet baristas and a yummy menu. a little affected in it's ambiance, so it attracts every bearded hipster guy in a five mile radius, but still worth a shot."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Nice clean place. Bought coffee. Great coffee. Outside tables with heaters 10 feet above in case cold day. 1st time there.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"At other Reveille shops, I really enjoy their espresso drinks. This one, not so much -- their cappuccino is simply a shorter latte, no microfoam at all."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,The bowls are to die for. I am moving out of SF in one week and I think I’d be willing to spend each lunch I have left having a Tahini Squash Bowl over and over again.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Just opened! (Feb 8 '17) Reveille brings their Cafe to the Lower Height. Same great coffee, same great food. Very excited to see this location thrive."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"This location is not yet open, but should be by the end of 2017.  Based on my experiences at the other Reveille Coffees in SF, this should be a great neighborhood cafe with high quality coffee and espresso drinks, and delicious pastries and small food plates as well."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Really great cafe, everything on the menu is high quality. The Steiner location is a nice place to sit outside."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Super cute place for coffee, pastries and breakfast food. Also close to Duboce park where you can take your food and have yourself a picnic."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Great food, coffee and vibe."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Very friendly staff, fairly limited pastry/baked goods, but adequate for the location (busy pedestrian area)."

Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Good drinks, but not a good place to set up station to work. Very few outlets and super narrow seating."
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Was ok but the latte seems a little overpriced for a small and I wish they had asked if I wanted it sweetened because it was too sweet for me.
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,A great brew with fantastic service and.... A perfect name...Cafe Réveille...!!
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,When I ask for largest cofee and getting a small cup... Disappointed. It was also a bit on the sour side. The almond croissant was ok.

Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,"Sadly, not a great experience as a vegetarian—I ordered the breakfast sandwich with the bacon on the side, and they left it on. When I brought it back, they just removed the bacon rather than remaking it. Otherwise, decent food and nice outdoor seating!"
Cafe Réveille,201 Steiner St,Coffee and matcha latte are delicious Salad crunchy bowl? not good... Salty and sour kale flavor mixed with shiitake mushrooms and coriander... Works on a breakfast sandwich? I added something and it was fine.
