Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Best place to stop by if you’re craving for a drink to keep you warm when it’s cold outside. Had the caramel macchiato and it was exactly what I needed. Service was incredibly efficient despite having decreased staff.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,First time placing order for pick up (yes I am delayed or behind the times as I do like human interaction). It was great prior to my 0815 “Oppenheimer” film. 🤩 ☕️ 🥐
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Their Lavender Cold Brew Oat Latte with Brown Sugar Jelly tastes so GOOD!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great coffee shop and a lovely Starbucks alternative. Got the egg and bacon brioche which was super tasty.  Nice indoor and outdoor seating area on Market Street with friendly staff.  Keep up the good work.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Nice Peet's.  Right next to Powell Street Bart by Ross Store and across the street from Old Navy.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating.  There is also a limited upstairs seating too.  I saw there r a couple of outlets to charge your cell phone in the seating area downstairs.  Nice big ceiling to floor windows to stay cozy while watching everyone go by..
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,a nice and convenient location to grab a coffee and snack throughout the day. i tried the dark chocolate mocha and a slice of the cinnamon swirl coffee cake and both were very nice.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,This Peet’s cafe is the only one near Union Square! As a huge Peet’s fan I’m so happy it’s here. Very friendly! Great beverages!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,A great place to pick up a morning coffee and pastries.  Quick service and friendly.  Prices are standard and not overpriced.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great! Strong coffee! Good flavor. Staff was helpfull and nice. Remade my orde to make me happy without additional charges. Will definately go back.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"THANK YOU for quickly letting me use your fabulous clean bathroom, even though I was not a customer, and I never spent $0.01 here. People don't forget about stuff like this. That was like a month ago. I really had to go. Haha"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Got jumped and pepper sprayed outside the store the night of 3/2 by a bunch of teenagers - go inside Peets for help, and the employees treat me like I'm some kind of animal.  There was only one young man working in there who had any kind of compassion whatsoever. Hats off to him. The other employees should be ashamed of themselves."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"This is my weekend PEETS. They are nice youngsters working here 🌹!  Please do not forget to tip you barista, their wages are not enough to live on in San Francisco! 😇"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"very dirty place full of beggars and everyone very rude, I think it's because of the number of people who go to this place, because it's on the market, so it's crowded there, so this means that the employees clearly don't have much patience, so , a simple mix-up, made the two girls treat me like shi t it seems that I committed something very serious, they are rude and without patience, including this Asian woman who was working there today, if you don't like your job, look for another place to work, that then you don't have to make that shi t face that you did today, that's my little suggestion for you. (NEGATIVE STARS)"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Got a cortado, and it was good. Everything was clean and was not too loud or too quiet. As far as perts coffee locations in SF, this is good."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Coffe was good but the Place was insanely dirty
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Excellent! Baristas were super friendly and helpful. I saw this dessert and asked for a recommendation to drink with it, almond latte. Price point was great (under $7 for both). They didn’t ask for a tip and the WiFi is very easy to access. The atmosphere at this location is many solo people getting work done."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,I live their chocolate croissants which are way better than in Starbucks. Inside the lines may be daunting. Toilets on passcode. Wifi available with strong signal. Location is perfect for bart station and major shopping venues. Will miss those croissants. Ask to heat them.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,They have some good seating options upstairs and outside.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,@liam @773market ...  He made the best drink.. took his time and made it peerrffeecctt!!! Definitely will be having him make my drinks when I go there and he's there ..  😎👌.. from beginning to end was perfect 💯💯💯 THANK YOU LIAM .. keep up the great work
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The cold brew is very nice the staff very helpful.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"They always treat me super nicely, spell my name correctly and the coffee doesn't taste burnt like another nearby chain. If I'm buying coffee this is the place I like to go."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Nice Peet’s. Nice view of the street. Two-story with free WiFi and clean bathrooms. The staff is friendly and helpful. They are busy all the time. One of the busiest Peet’s I’ve been to. I was able to sit here and wait an hour or two for my friend to get off work undisturbed.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Coffee is great. clean place, nice decor for a café. Service not as friendly as expected."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I'm not much of a cafe person, so take it with a grain of salt (or don't). But the cafe isn't an ideal workspace. It's noisy and the music is loud too. The glasses are dirty and the floor aren't great where the power outlets are; and you have to use your fingers to open (unless I am doing it wrong). However, the staff seemed nice and the Chai I had was great too. So, pros and cons I guess."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Don't come here to work. None of the electrical outlets work and they're not interested in fixing them. They have labels on half of them that say ""outlets don't work""."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Good place to chill, rest your legs and have some coffee. Clean place, nice jazz music. Friendly staff. Had the latte. Better than starbucks but Blue Bottle is better if you want some comparison."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I totally would recommend to stay away of this place! It’s San Francisco, baby 🤣🤮 crazy disgusting crowd inside and outside of this coffee shop. They also use their restroom all the time. Try to find better neighbours especially if you are a tourist and don’t want to ruin your trip impression"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"If you are a star bucks regular stick with their coffee but if you are not a regular coffee person then try Peet’s , they have great options too with a little bit of their own twist and coffee from different region"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"POWER OUTLETS DON'T WORK!  Bring a fully charged laptop!  They have outlets on the wall equipped with USB plugs but they ""don't work""  Message received, you don't want us lingering. Guess I'll get my coffee and do some work at Starbucks, and buy another coffee and maybe a scone. Look at that, you just lost $25."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The food and staff were great. It was dirty and the people in that area are interesting
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Fast service when not crowded. Good taste from drinks and food. Typically, fast service at counter for ordering."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Alexis and Jasmine gave great hospitality to me and my guest great place as usual
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"The coffee from this outlet is so diluted and does not smell like coffee at all! It's just like drinking a cup of sugar water! And to add to my misery, the coffee was luke warm!  Do walk over to the nearby Starbucks where you can get a good cup of steaming coffee!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Ordered grande Cappuccino with extra wipped cream (for free) - done   quick and staff very friendly
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"If you are familiar with Starbucks this place is quite the same. Overall same prices, menu is nearly identical- but in my opinion the coffee tasted better. Seating area could be improved (seems like they focus on take-away)"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Aggressively similar to Starbucks and priced about the same too. I ordered a vanilla latte, breakfast sandwich and a lemon scone. And I don't think I could have told you the difference between them and Starbucks in a blind taste test. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing, I did enjoy all of it. But it's not something I would go out of my way to get."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Popped in here as the more famous branded coffee place over the road was closed. It was a mistake, baristas are painfully slow and rude. The whole ordering and delivery system is flawed. You get a tea immediately but your coffee takes 15 minutes to arrive. Gave up in the end. Give it a miss, there must be better options in the local area."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The like the environment and the outside seats. Good place to study specially inside or in their second floor.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Very good but expensive compared to another cities.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Zero merchandise on the shelves. The place was trashed. The staff was very rude.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Honestly not good at all: never went to a peet’s coffee and it was not edible
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Worst Peet’s shop in town… staff is rude and sanitation is missing.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Coffee is good but unfortunately they don’t use a recup system or normal cups. So it’s a lot of rubbish 🥺👀 please 🙏 think of becoming more sustainable. Our Earth needs that🌍 …
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,AMAZING service. When I ordered my Peet's app balance was exactly one cent short (what are the odds?) and I was told not to worry about it. Also I accidentally dropped my sandwich right after picking it up and they gave me a new one for free. Staff are very nice here.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Finally a few coffee shops open!!  Pete's coffee is a welcome reminder of the days of old. Able to sit and have a nice cup of black gold. Been here several times since opening and it's great. Great staff, great service. Coffee seems a bit pricey, but hey everyone is trying to make a come back at this point. Plenty of plugins and places to sit inside or out."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Typically a Starbucks fanatic. I stopped by Peet's because it was near my work for a Monday. I love extra sweet and creamy drinks.  Not sure what on their menu might satisfy my craving for coffee heaven, the cashier recommended the ""Black Tie.""  The Barista added extra Condensed Milk and topped it off with rich Cold Brew. Bam!! I'll be back!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I went in the early morning slightly before the rush hour. The place was occupied by customers, but not too many at that hour. The baristas were very cheerful, maybe a little future for that time of the morning me not being a morning person. I'm beginning to think Pete's is more favored by me than Starbucks."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great service! The barista and cashier helped me pick a beverage and were patient as I was deciding due to my dietary restrictions! Pastries are fresh and delicious and much more affordable than other places!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Lovely, pleasant staff. Really a cut above the rest in terms of customer service. Cute little location with a selection of baked goods as well. The coffees here were a tad too sweet for my liking and none of them were on the menu as having sweetener, so that was a star off. If you have sugar intake concerns be sure to check before you order. Also, a homeless guy harassed me to buy him a coffee on my way in and out but I guess this is San Fran what can I expect."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Decent coffee, service is lacking. Missed off a pastry item then when i went back they ran out."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Poor quality berry scones. Very dry, barely any berry flavor and had a weird clove taste. The iced cinnamon bun was soft and nice though."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great coffee and warm atmosphere with ample study / work space. Was pretty crowded. Reliable but slow WiFi.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Decided to make it our go to coffee place while in San Francisco. Really friendly staff with a good, consistent espresso. Will definitely be back when we're back town!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"super strong flatwhite, very friendly staff"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Friendly staff and MUCH BETTER QUALITY than Starbucks. The atmosphere is quiet and they have outlets so you can study or do work on your computer. They don't play loud music like other coffee bars.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Unbelievable price gouging  This is the only coffee shop that charged close to $1 for a small amount of soy milk.  They did not have the courtesy of being upfront and honest.  This is the worst Peets location.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Nice and clean place for a quick breakfast and coffee before your workday.  There’s a nice loft on second floor that’s well lit and clean. See my sideways picture for a view. Relatively quiet up there where you can gather your thoughts before tackling your work. Will stop by again.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The place is dirty and they always mess my order.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Extremely dirty. The peppermint mocha had almost no flavor. Nevertheless, the cookies tasted great as well as the banana bread. The Caramel Javiva tasted OK but I prefer the Starbucks Caramel Frappuccino. In addition, the service was excellent. The employee who took our order had a lot of energy and amazing attitude."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,cheap and delicious breakfast. Tried gold latte and it's not bad.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"This place is great. Swift service and delicious coffee. I love the Golden Chai with coconut milk. One of the workers helped give me directions as well, since it was my first time in San Francisco. The staff was all around super friendly."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"The staff are friendly and very helpful. Gotta try the chicken and waffle sandwich, YUM-O!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great staff, but keep seeing prices go up and up for coffee. $3.10 for a large and now they’ve decided to tack on the Healthy SF tax. Might as well by a pound of French Roast and make it at home.  Used to have security to deal with panhandling, but now they leave it up to staff to deal with."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"One of the best coffee places I visit. Open very early, and the cranberry and walnut scones are a treat. On two occasions I have watched a young woman, who I assume was a manager, interacting with the baristas in a positive, respectful manner. A little place on Market, down from Powell street station.. felt a little like home."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Best place in the city to get an awesome cup of coffee. People are friendly and the service is prompt. Do yourself a favor: caramel Javiva swirl! You will love this place and the atmosphere. So much better than Starbucks!!!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I think the Customer service here is wonderful. Lines move fast compared to Starbucks across the street. I absolutely love the Nitro. That's my drink normally, large nitro. I think Eli is by far one of the best to represent that coffee house. He always remembers his regulars. He is just a very polite and friendly guy. Everyone there actually seems to be great so far. Been there maybe 25 times since it opened. Will definitely continue going, personally I think their coffee is better than Starbucks anyhow."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,A nice Café for take a break. 🇺🇸🇹🇭🇩🇪🇨🇭🏳️‍🌈💚 …
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Below average. They forgot to make my wrap, then were totally unapologetic. If you run a busy coffee shop, you need a system that keeps track of the orders, and at least apologize if you get it wrong."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Service is pretty good, they can be slow at times. The coffee is solidly good, better than Starbucks I would say. They also have one of my favorite breakfast items, chicken chorizo flat bread."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"The place is nice and so are the the staff. The only thing that bugged me though were the homeless people. I mean I am paying money not only to enjoy the coffee but as well a quiet time with myself and my computer and all of the sudden a random person smelling awfully bad asking me to purchase from him a Bart ticket. 😡 I really hope this issue can be addressed because this is not the first time that this happened, otherwise I would have given this place a five star."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Coffee was decent, service was ok"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I'm from Chicago,  where Peet's cafe's are sparsely located.  They're on EVERY corner in downtown San Francisco and it's great.   I  really like that you get credit for checking in. Love the mochas, tried the almond croissant today...yummy."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"WARNING:Not a Charger- friendly coffees shop. You’ll have no electricity to all ya devices. Nothing wrong about the coffee nor service, they were good. 0 To all the charger outlets that all off, they dont want u to work here, you  r expected to spend and LEAVE!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,I started going to Peet's after they closed all of the Starbucks locations in close proximity to my job. They give fast and friendly service and the coffee is better than Starbucks tbh!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Super Nice and since it is my Go-To place, they even take the time to remember my name. Overall A+++ Fast Service and Quality of Coffe and food.  - Super fast and always Smiling, On point here!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Good place to take a break from the busy Market Street. Pavement and window seating. There's a balcony inside which offers a view of the coffee shop, not the street. The coffee is good. There is the option to get a ceramic cup if you wanna be waste-free. Can be a bit of a wait to be served. #letsguide  #localguides"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The upstairs is pretty nice for studying but the outlets don't work and the wifi kinda sucks. Also its kind of cold so definitely bring a sweater if you're staying a while!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Good coffee but one restroom wasn't working and the other didn't have soap. Worst of all, there are no working plugs in the store to charge your laptop or phone. Mediocre experience, room for improvement."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Coffee in its natural state is bitter and disgusting, kind of like a 90-year-old lech who's paralyzed from the neck down. The Havana Espresso makes it into a 50-year-old James Bond played by Sean Connery: suave, smooth and inexpressibly sexy in a non-creepy way that only he can pull off. If there's outdoor seating available, please be aware that this, too, is a ""No Smoking"" area."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"This is the old Coffee Bean. Peet's did a fabulous job remodeling this site and now this is a two-story coffee house.  New fixtures, excellent customer service, good music, good pastry selection, and great coffee.  What's not to love?"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"The company lost a star by having more pastries than a breakfast bar at a Willy Wonka factory but a single bagel offering. Get a clue, Pete. Whole grains are healthier than processed sugar. How they lost the second star and inspired me to write this review is that I yet again had to explain that when I ask for something toasted, I don’t mean that I want warmed in a toaster. I want it brown. If I had wanted it warmed, I’d have used that word, not the word ‘toasted’."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Fast service, good coffee, fair prices"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I have to admin I might have been lucky. It’s a run of the mill place but we sure got a wonderful coffee experience! Wouldn’t have expected it, truth be told.  I welcome anyone to try it out. We only went there once. For sure would come back!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Most of the staff are very nice but the girl who was doing the coffees where rude above the acceptance limit. Besides, the croissant was cold and heavy. Next time I will cross the road to Starbucks"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great location with quick servers and uncommon, for downtown, outdoor seating, with heat if you sit under the storefront awning.  And most importantly, the regular brewed coffee is great."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"The coffee is Peet's standard good and the staff is friendly, but the location and some of the traffic is more than a little zany."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"My go-to coffeeshop when in downtown San Francisco. Service is quick, good coffee as usual, and they have outside seating, which is great! Only downsides are the dirty bathroom and slow wifi."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Always the best Peet's I've been in so far. Copious seating with all ""'crow's nest"" upstairs too! Located directly on Market St.yet set -back enough to avoid the whole race-track vibe that main thoroughfare can sometimes have. Pick up coffee then get a ""Beard Poppa"" custard pastry, or vise versa and you still can't go wrong. Enjoy!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,There is a lot of open space here.  I think it's the best place to have coffee (The cocoa is also very good) & people watch.  The altitude of the atmosphere can be amplified by an attitude of gratitude!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Very crowded, and they forgot my pastry."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great coffee, No problem to use your own cup, which is not the case everywhere. Oat milk and soy options."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I love Peet's, especially since i gave up espresso coffee. They make great chai lattes, much better than their competition (who shall remain nameless). And I love their chorizo flatbread and blueberry/blackberry scones. My only real gripe? You get one point per visit no matter how many items you buy. I usually split the orders when my family and I go."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Good coffee to take out
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great place to take a breath and a well done beverage. I enjoyed the plant based sandwich it's completely vegan, I definitely recommend the place and the vegan sandwich."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Has good customer service and quick serving time. The coffee was not as per my taste. But if you love bitter coffee, it's the place for you."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,What happened- a few years ago this used to be the best place to get coffee!!! Coffee was fair at best. The staff were professional and nice and did go out of there way to get things right.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Racist white security at peets tells only colored people to leave the business and I'm a peets rewards guy but not anymore ....peets was ok til the hired security now its no good anymore.  I guess ill be going back to 711 and get me coffee til he's fired....... lots of people will know how racist that security guard is  Thanks to both of the managers they are on my side and support me awesome.   That security guard with the tats all over his arm (he has white skin)yeah that's why I'm making this bad review other than that. The other security guard he is black and isn't like tat jack
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Iced Coconut latte is amazing!!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The coffee shop founded in Berkeley. I like it! Outdoor seating. Soy milk and wifi available. Ask for real mugs to avoid waste!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The usual high quality coffee that I have come to expect from Peets.  Nice upstairs seating area is comfortable and gives a little break from the hectic street scene just outside.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Its good,  but outside area should be better monitored, we were the only ones sitting outside drinking coffee.. a lot of loitering and one guy was actually selling weed two tables over from us!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great coffee! Great place
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Dante is the kind of person I want working for me. In a situation that was not his fault at all, he stepped up and took responsibility for another barista's mistake. This is the kind of strong character I want in my supervisors."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,If you take cream in your coffee you will have an ice coffee when served coffee at this location in the winter. Peets coffees are notoriously luke warm when served and Corporate Peets is too paranoid to even reheat it for you. They try by adding a fraction more coffee to the top. As if.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I had the caramel macchiato and it was amazing. A lot cheaper compared to other coffee shops, too."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great coffee in a great location. Market Street,  San Francisco"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,I love the Assam tea that the Peets coffee sell. Although you wont find in all the stores. I love it and this outlet had it. Made me happy .
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Staff are friendly, drinks are always good, I love Peet’s coffee and its drinks. I highly recommend this brand."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Revealed as a must when coming out of powell stop, has wifi, good seats, good view. Not what an italian would prefer at all but it worth it!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Best coffee, nice environment, great hospitality"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Don't go to Pete's on 16th st. or 9 th st. they're not very  friendly at all they said to me you always come in here. They don't want to take care of me. I'll never go to those establishment ever again. I heard what one of them said wasn't very nice.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,The Dark Chocolate Holiday Mocha was delicious especially paired with a almond and butter croissant! Peet's is always a winner in my book they're local.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,One of the best coffee chains anywhere. Always good service.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"A very disappointing Peets. Poor quality (tasteless and weak) specialty drinks and coffee. Great service and atmosphere, but not enough for a Peetnik to return!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Out of mint tea :( the flavor they gave was gross
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Friendly service and good coffee, however do not expect to get work done if you require WIFI. Connection and stability is terrible."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Was ok, people nice enough, let me use restroom. Didn't buy anything but from the strong aroma I instantly knew why people were in love with the place."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great place! Excellent coffee (everything very nice) and attention, conveniently located, very comfortable."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great coffee. Delicious pastries. Very friendly staff who radiate goodwill - a rare quality these days.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,typical SF staff. order ahead but wait as if you didn't while you watch them BS with friends. It's hot out. why are you wearing a cap?
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Very average experience. Plenty of homeless sitting outside taking up their tables, but it is SFO. The oatmeal was so bad I had to throw it out."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great location with lots of seating! However, not sure if it is common, but the WiFi was extremely slow on my visit."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Coffee was ok, nothing special to be honest. The cafe could be a bit cleaner, especially the outside sitting area is not very welcoming (tables are used down and the floor is messy)"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Lets keep them going. Great coffee and  location!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"The coffee is just great. However none of the power outlets nor the internet worked, staff seemed careless about it."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"place got updated recently but still accessible for the homeless population of San Francisco. good coffee and tea, kind personal"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I really enjoyed their traditional cappuccino. They are very friendly. Next time in in town, I hope to return."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,good coffee ... awful matcha. Artifical customer service.  This isn’t chacha-matcha of soho nyc or even close so don’t get matcha here...
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,There's nothing not to love about Peets Coffee. It's the best in the world; wherever you buy it. And my favorite is... Garuda!!!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Tasty coffee and oatmeal and great that they're open from 6:00am!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great environment and very fast service. Coffee was excellent in flavor and quality.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Love the atmosphere, but outlets didnt work, so couldn't charge my battery."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Convenient location,  dependable cup of coffee."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"If you enjoy the experience of having a good coffee, avoid this place. The worst coffee i have had in sf"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great coffe and a lovely terrace; great spot for people-watching because it's busy out on the street most of the time :)
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Non-existent WiFi and neither do any of the power sockets work. Good coffee chain, but not at this location."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Bruno had an awesome attitude. Made my day brighter
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Your best choice! The champion of breakfast!
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,Great customer service. Coffee tastes great too
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great coffee, will definitely be back"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,I had a wonderful cup of coffee there while waiting for my dog to get his shots at Petco.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,It can get really busy here. It’s not a cozy place. Very cold and stark. Service is good though.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Great tasting black coffee, not burnt/bitter tasting like a lot of coffee chains."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Racist staff, if the coffee was OK the actions of the clerk made it sour. I would recommend the Starbucks that is crossing the street."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"Eli rang me up today and made my entire day!!!  Saw him bring a smile to every customer he helped, I would hire him if I could, thanks Eli !!"
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,I thought they were very friendly and the service was good. No pretentiousness here at least for today.
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I go for morning coffee at Peet's, One California, big highrise at the start of the Financial District. Here is the scene outside."
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,They cut the power as another reveiwer wrote. What sort of coffee shop charges 4$ for an Americano and then cuts the power?
Peet's Coffee,773 Market St,"I love Peet's anyway, but this location is especially nice. The staff is friendly, well trained, and efficient."
