Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Hidden little Starbucks in the financial district - much less crowded than the one on the corner of Battery and Clay. Service is fast, store was clean and basically empty. No waiting for drinks and food and no crowd. Definitely a good place sto stop on the way to work."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,There isn't any tables inside just 1 booth and I guess it's a bay window. But you can't use the bathroom unless you buy something (alot of the restaurant and shops are like that). Otherwise the food and drinks aren't bad.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Had a coffee this morning and witnessed a rare scene of a team working together in friendly and supportive atmosphere. Special thanks to initiative girl that helped me on 14th, in the morning, when I lost my place in line."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,It was warmer outside than inside. I wanted somewhere to sit have some water and finish some personal business but it was freezing inside :(
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Please bring back sitting places, it’s so bad that in CA it’s so hard to find Starbucks where you can sit and work 😥 in NJ everywhere they have it! Covid time is done… …"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Instant 1 star for laziness / knowingly making the wrong drink. The label said decaf but the batista served me regular anyway. I cannot have caffeine due to a heart defect...  I let the batista know and she apologized and switched it for me, but that's not the kind of thing they can ignore. I also asked for vanilla at the front and the cashier did not mark that correctly. Starbucks already charges too much, they should at least make the right drink."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"I was a regular customer at this Starbuck's.  I spent on average $40 a week there.  I always got a Venti coffee with two raw sugar and extra cream.  This morning (05OCT22) in the 6 AM hour, I ordered my coffee and a sausage cheddar breakfast sandwich.  There were 4 people behind the counter and not many in the shop.  I had to leave after waiting 11 minutes and I did not get my order.  I have to get to my job and don't have a long time to wait.  This is a poor way to treat a regular customer.  I will not return there again."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"The place is well maintained, service is friendly. Toilets are slightly dirtier."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"On Saturday afternoon, you can find a chair to sit. The store is clean; the complimentary Wi-Fi is fast. It's probably different if coming during the week."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"My morning go to coffee spot near Transamerica. You'd think they would staff more than 2 or sometimes even 1 person in a location like this! Sometimes I get a really good on the ball barrista that can run alone, sometimes there are 3 stooges there that cannot get it together. Needs management, to regulate quality control. Good products, enjoy the Machiatto Caramel and egg bites on the go often here."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,The workers on Wednesday morning at 10 am were really rude!
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Ordered a ice coffee didn't receive a 100 rewards.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Ordered drinks from here on Uber eats yesterday. I received a wrong order of a drink I could not have. Typically there’s an option on Uber eats to review receipt and receive a refund but there was not that option with this particular location. I was unable to report to Uber that I received a wrong item. Just know that if you order a drink off a third party delivery service that you may get the wrong item and be unable to get a refund. Does not make me want to order from this location again. Not sure if all Starbucks don’t allow reporting of incorrect items or receiving refunds.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Starbucks use to be a place where I could enjoy a decent cup of coffee. But since the pandemic the staff like at some locations tend to do business for themselves, I ordered an expresso drink , paid for of course and received all the garnishment with no expresso"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"The first few times I came to this Starbucks, I had no issues, there were two young and really polite Asian men baristas that I liked were usually there. But my last two times here there were a couple of women baristas that just give off the rudest vibe. One I can already name, Mae. The first out of the last 2 times I was there, she was already giving off a NOT polite vibe, when I ordered she said ""For here or to go""  and I am thinking ""Um its Starbucks and I am ordering a drink..?"" Then when I showed her both my vaccination proof AND my ID, she stared at it for longer than anyone I have showed it too has, even in Germany people never read it for longer . So maybe their English ia better than hers...? On top of that the taller Asian woman barista kept staring at me weird every 5-10 minutes when I was just on my phone and sipping my drink. Otherwise this Starbucks is fine."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Really great Starbucks. And that's coming from someone that works for the company. Partners were very friendly even though it was close to closing. Still seemed genuinely happy to see us. The store was clean and the drinks made perfect. Kyra was extremely friendly and let me take a San Francisco card as a souvenir. You guys are really walking Starbucks values.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"It's your typical Starbucks - glad to see it's still open during COVID. I always order ahead on the mobile app, so I've never had trouble waiting. Staff have always been pleasant and friendly in my experience.  Additionally, they have the nitro cold brew here which is one of my faves!"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Great hot coffee. Not packed. Plenty of places to sit, including a handicapped table."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Ok spot for coffee. Service is inconsistent. Employees seem disinterested in providing a pleasant customer experience. Definitely not my first choice, but convenient when there's nothing else open."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Very mute and unwelcoming Starbucks. They don't great anyone, white, black, asian people very very rude don't even ask you what you want, don't NOT come here there are 30,000 Starbucks that treat you better."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Usually good service...until now. Placed mobile order, arrived early enough to see person finishing my drink. Person filled the cup leaving half an inch from the top and covered it. I had to ask this person to top it off. Had I not been standing there watching, I would have been ripped off!"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Good service here though they probably will get your name wrong 😂 and it can be a bit busy unless you're there at 5:30 or 6am …
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Awesome place! Most of the stuff here work hard & are very nice. They don't care who you are UNLIKE  Starbucks on Drum street they seem to be discriminative: they can't  give a cup of water if you are black. This place is just awesome. Thank you for all you do here!
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Good coffee, no ashy flavor and the bkfast sandwich was better than Peets"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Worst starbucks ever. Staff is nice and friendly but slow.  There is not enough place to sit. Mural plugs are not functioning so you cannot charge any electronic device. There is only one bathroom which is crowded. Cleanliness is not at its top either.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Horrible Starbucks experience! I couldn’t believe how a “Manager Allison” would conduct herself in a way where we felt discriminated against., over a coffee refill, we are talking about .50 cents. I’m guessing this is a norm for her. We’re pretty sure we are not the first she harassed over .50 cents. We have high expectations for the quality service Starbucks always provide, except for today. Manager Allison is an ugly look for representing Starbucks. Very disappointed in her representation of Starbucks."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"this place is always busy, but very fast. they handle traffic really well and make drinks in under several minutes. the place is spacious, so you don't feel cramped up"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Nice, spacious coffee place with free Wi-Fi for you to work and have a good drink at the same time. Love the ambience of the place, but I was less than impressed to hear they close at 8 pm in the evenings. Definitely worth a visit."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Good service, but totally burnt the coffee. Need to learn how to pull a proper shot."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"After 9am it dies down considerably, before then it's often crowded with frustrated staff but friendly and efficient."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Came in early on a typical 5:00 am Monday to grab a cup of coffee for a refill when we were pushed away by the manager name Allison. She yelled out loud in front of other customers that we could not get a coffee refill for .50 cents. Yelling vulgar language... to us it felt like she was being discriminatory. We’ve never experience this type of “hellish” customer service from Starbucks. We’ve been to many Starbucks all over the US and this by far the worse. This “ Manager Allison” does not signify, not remotely aligned with Starbucks Mission and Values."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Products are good, very busy, staff tries but often fails on efficient service. Just don't expect fast service during peak hours. If in no hurry, have fun and leave a tip for most who apparently don't. Enjoy"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Very nice staff. We stopped in there every day because we are less than a block away. It is a very busy place and the employees that work there to a really good job of trying to keep up.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,It is 4am and my friend and I visited this spot. The Asian guy with the moustache extremely assuming and disrespectful. He just threw our drinks at us without a word. He treated us like garbage and ghosts with his silence and didn't even say thank you to us after we ordered. Fire him please.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,The oat milk latte is great !
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"considering the area its located and how generally busy it is there, i was able to order my drink and received it quickly. And I enjoyed it too lol. It was cold and tasted great."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,When I was homeless I used to go there every day...Mainly to use their bathroom and their wi-fi...But they never gave me any problems. I would usually try to buy a drink but $5.25 is a lot of money when you are homeless.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"All Starbucks, US, UK, Spain, Italy, Finland.... Are equally disappointing. Feels like the McDonald's of coffee, just food prepared in the quickest and most careless way!"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"I  am very surprise that other costumer had same situation like me, JARED, is the name of the guy, very rude, I was there and ask for the bathroom, and he said me that it is only for costumer and if I will buy something, I said maybe yes or not because I needed use the bathroom and when I try to show him my Starbucks apps on my cellphone he though that I took a pic of him. Then he understands that I am costumer and say me that he asks if I am costumer. He really was very rude, not have manners. He is the only one rude that I found after be in San Francisco for 12 days. I called Tricia the district manager, I was worry that maybe the guys there not have a good time when they work, but maybe is only JARED. And btw the bathroom was very dirty."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Came in here for maybe my first time. Place is around the corner from my office. Decent size, friendly employees just pumping out the orders. Not a lot of places to sit. Not good for large groups."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Just opposite my school, this place is where we almost visit every day for the break. The service is good as usual. There is small concern they could upgrade there is no rest room inside."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"JaRed (as displayed on his name tag) was rude and spacey, making me jump through hoops to fix an issue with stocking on the app. It was an issue that should have taken 30 seconds to fix but left me wasting 10 minutes. I know this because this location has failed to update its app’s stock on multiple occasions (meaning the app thought the product I wanted to order was sold out). It didn’t feel like there will be any resolution to this locations poor accounting as a result of my repeated feedback. I’m switching to the 555 California st location."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Not a single chair. Avoid if you need to do some work.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Typical Starbucks. Peppermint hot chocolate, great music, good Wi-Fi. Great place to take a time out, relax, connect online and get ready to roll again."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Good service, same quality of food and drink from any Starbucks. We were here while visiting SFO and were treated very well by staff at this location."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,This place is great very clean friendly staff and busy location near Financial District Broadway. I will definitely go back again when I'm in the neighborhood thanks again!
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Not what it used to be ! ☕ Still good brew though ( but where is the Komodo dragon blend or House blend for example !?!) What'd the 🥐☕🧇🍵 …
Starbucks,565 Clay St,I said I wanted normal cappuccino the woman assumed herself it is a frapuccino. do you guys know about cappuccino?? I had to take an order and go with it bad experience
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"During my morning Saturday visit I saw four homelesses seating, sleaping, laudly speaking with self. Not relaxing place to enjoy of drinking coffee"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"When it's prime time in the mornings, waiting for regular coffee is fast. Waiting for baked goods will be about 5-10 minute wait."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Not bad at all,fast service but the space it's not big enough for this location and it's hard to get in with a wheelchair.Not becuase I'm a handicap or neither I have a wheelchair but I have seen other customers trying to get on the store."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,I was staying in the Hilton financial district and I came here multiple times during my trip. They were very timely and I had absolutely no complaints
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Well, a starbuck with nothing special. But that starbuck was probably the dirtiest starbuck I've ever stopped by. Plus toilets are locked and it is quite painful to get into it..."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,The service was great eat people were friendly and the Starbucks Cards were in every way Awesome!
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"restroom were locked, very inconvient when need to use before order, especially when long line. Went to the other SB instead."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Super crowded i'm pretty sure I'm one of the only people who didn't order in advance... Took forever.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"The mocha was quite tasteless, as well Z the hot chocolate. The location is kind of dull. And there really isn't much room to work."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"It’s a Starbucks so I’m going to skip all the generic Starbucks stuff and rate this one against other Starbucks  Cons: 1) The building is a bit cramped 2) The bathrooms have a lock system on them (makes sense, but when compared to Starbucks that don’t have them, well, it’s a negative) 3) They give you paper straws that seem to fall apart"
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Been there about 5 times and they have bad adherence to customer drink customization. Luckily there's a Starbucks 2 minutes walk down clay.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,There are NO OUTLETS to plug in laptop.  They've blocked them all.  Booooo!!!!
Starbucks,565 Clay St,Lazy staff close up before the advertised closing time :(

Starbucks,565 Clay St,Efficient and friendly. Vaccine proof needed to drink in.
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Very busy location, staff was very friendly; however, not very attentive to needs of customers."

Starbucks,565 Clay St,"In San Francisco, there are so many Starbucks that you feel like you are walking three steps down the street! Surprised (laughs). In San Francisco, there are a lot of Starbucks I had feeling that when I walk three steps on the street you hit the cafe I was astonished."
Starbucks,565 Clay St,"Tasty as always, expensive as always. Finally start using normal dishes if you don't take things to go. That also works in Germany."
