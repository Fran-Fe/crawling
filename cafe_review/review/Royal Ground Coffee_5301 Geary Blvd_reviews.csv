Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"I love coming here because they’re so sweet, coffee is good and ive never been dissatisfied till today. I was almost done with my salad when i saw a fly in it. It was pretty big. I was already at work and couldnt show them since i left but now i dont even wanna go back"
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,Quickly becomming my favorite local coffee shop! That's saying something because there is a plethora of coffee shops in the Richmond. The food here is awesome (I get the breakfast sandos and the veggie sandwich 🤤) and the coffee is good. The staff is super friendly and efficient and the prices are reasonable especially for what you get. The inside is cozy and usually quiet. I come here at least once a week now; I highly recommend it!
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,Coffee was burnt. Surprisingly unfriendly staff. Told me I cannot charge my stuff after I bought a coffee. Negative vibe.
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Fresh food, good coffee,  clean quiet place,  excellent service..."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Pretty solid food for the price. Their coffee is nice as well. Loads of places to sit with outlets available. One of my favorite spots to relax on my laptop. Music played over the speakers is not distracting.  Update: They redesigned the cafe! Looks great. Would recommend checking it out. Very clean, but not sterile. Homely, yet modern. Definitely worth a revisit. Food and drink quality are still worth the price. Outlets, WiFi, soft music all give a great atmosphere for a cafe."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"What happened? They closed for what seemed like forever to remodel and when they reopened, they had a breakfast menu, a less cluttered layout with more seating and coffee that was as good, if not better than ever. They soon ditched the breakfast menu for the usual bagel menu, and the quality/taste of the coffee changed - for the worse. I really preferred this place to the sterile Peet's a block away, but if I can't even get a good cup of coffee....??? I've been back to check on the coffee, but it's still not to my liking (strong and rich)."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"I really enjoy getting my coffee there. I always get the bagel w/Lox and cream cheese.   Even if it gets crowded it's a nice place to sit down and enjoy breakfast/brunch, and have a chat with a friend.  I have never been there later, so not sure if it gets busier. Service is good and they are fast. The place is very clean, for that I Igave the fifth star."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"If you’re looking for a place to study, write, think, dream in the Richmond—look no further. Solid coffee. Cheap and good food, and excellent nooks to focus."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Went here for breakfast which was really tasty. The coffee was better than average although slightly too sour still. They have a good selection of food to choose from, and the waiters and barista were really nice. Good wifi is also a plus!"
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Such a great local coffee shop, much better than the chains in the area! Newly renovated, it’s spacious, quiet, has a large selection of food (salads, sandwiches, breakfast, deserts, etc). They have WiFi, and the coffee is good and strong!"
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,Whenever I travel I try to visit local coffee shops and this one was great. The coffee was fresh despite being late in the afternoon and the service was very friendly. The space is comfortable and though small inside people seemed to have plenty of space to work or read. The WiFi was good too.
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Coffee is pretty weak, if you need that caffeine kick you're going to need to get a double shot of something. That said, all I was looking for was a place to apply for a job with a comfy place to sit and that's what I got. Nice big windows to look out of/lots of sun, outlets everywhere and 2 large comfy (if a bit suspect looking) couches."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"I ordered milk and cake. They charge me tax on milk and the red velvet dream cake.  why would they charge me tax on the milk I ordered? It's 2.50 or 2.25 whatever it is.  And I didn't like it.  The middle-aged woman said if I'm not satisfied with the pricing, I can talk to the owner; she said she doesn't care; I said,"" you are stupid."" and she said F*** word to me. Then she started talk in the bad about me.  I'm speechless."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"They still roast the best beans in SF! If your a real man and like strong coffee, then you owe it to yourself to try maxs' blend! Starbuckians need not apply! I lived in the City for many years but have moved to other places, and every time I get back, I buy 5 pounds of Max's blend to take home with me."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"For all the coffee shops in San Francisco, I am surprised that this one is still operational. We're all a bit spoiled here in the city but not at Royal Ground Coffee. I left feeling like I needed to wash my hands. The staff was nice and friendly but tables were sticky, the smell of mildew was in the air and felt the kitchen area could have been more tidy."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"No drama, food and coffee bussin"
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Richmond local ""dive cafe"". You will see a mix of students, adults, and folks a little rough around the edges. Good coffee. Fresh smoothies, and serviceable food. Price is Right."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,They have a good selection of iced coffee and tea. They also have some sweet pastries to choose from. Good amount of seating and tables too. I would recommend this place for a quick coffee.
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"They actually have a decent deli selection. Tried the tuna. Came with all the toppings, and decent bread. Had to get it to go, but I wish I could have sat. Quite cosy. Will try another sandwich there soon."
Royal Ground Coffee,5301 Geary Blvd,"Very good drinks and food, friendly prices! Vintage-looking wooden chairs, tables with paintings on, large windows make the atmosphere great. Free WiFi."
