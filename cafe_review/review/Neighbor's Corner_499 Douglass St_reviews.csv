Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,My go-to weekend spot is hands down this place. Their Japanese fusion menu is simply amazing. The bakery items with mochi fillings are a must-try; the tamago sandwiches are also standout with their thick layers of fried egg. I was also pleasantly surprised with their seasonal special peach drink when I visited this weekend.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"A true little gem!  Stumbled in today and didn’t know it was a Japanese owned cafe.  I was super excited to have a Hojicha latte but the tea was on order from japan.  Met one of the owners who overheard me talking about the Hojicha and she was from beppu! A super cool town I just visited in japan a few months ago. She was super sweet.  The tamago sando and the turkey club were super fresh, high quality and Oishi!Wonderful bright ambiance, clean and lots of seating. Really can’t wait to return and support them. Five stars! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Fantastic ambience, clean and simple drinks and food selection. Staff was friendly. I would love to come back and try more of their drinks."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Pretty cute bright place, yummy pastry. I would give it 5 stars but just felt like the seating was a bit cold / not cozy and my drink was a 4/5. There was space to sit by the espresso bar that wasn’t comfy and in the center of the room a bit awkward. If you can find a spot by the window you’re golden. Also the oat milk was a bit bitter for my taste. But these were nit picky not glaring things and I really do like the space overall and the food looks delicious!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"I wanted to try Hedge coffee for a very long time, and finally found a spot in SF. The coffee itself is delicious, and there are some bagged beans for purchase as well. The atmosphere of this cafe is relaxed and non pretentious. But you got to go up the hill to get there:) bonus for dog owners, there is a jar with dog treats."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Amazing coffee (locally roasted) and Japanese teas (imported directly from Japan).  Great selection of fresh bakery and very delicious homemade sandwiches.  The warmth, welcoming and caring service of the owners is so heart warming. They made us feel at home and shared a meal (marinated sliced beef) they were preparing with us.  Definitely worth the stop if you are around SF."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Where do I even start with Neighbor’s Corner? Tl;dr at the bottom  I used to occasionally swing by this coffeeshop for a to-go coffee during the pandemic. I pass by one day in April 2022 and don’t recognize anyone behind the counter. When I ask, I’m told there was a change of ownership. Everyone seems nice but my first coffee-under-new-management is ok.  Within weeks, Maya-san, Ryoji-san and Kazmua-san, along with the owners of Hedge coffee, made adjustments to transform an “ok coffee” to some of the best coffee in the city. 6 months later, I can confidently say Neighbor’s serves top tier espresso-based coffee.  Everything from their espressos to their cappuccinos and mochas are fantastic. The cafe au lait at Neighbor’s is my cozy antidote to cold and/or foggy mornings in the city. Not in the mood for coffee? The matcha cappuccinos and hojicha lattes SLAP (smack may be the correct terminology in 2023? Or is it so 2020??)  Ok we get it, the coffee and tea is great (so is the breakfast sando, which can be made with a croissant fyi). But what makes Neighbor’s what it is are the people behind the counter. Maya-san has assembled an A-team of genuinely kind and very skilled people. They’ve built a place that feels like home for everyone: regulars from the surrounding neighborhood regularly (obviously) come for their morning coffee, alone with a book or with family / friends. Others come with their laptops for a couple of hours of focused work. On the weekend, a melange of people congregate and it all clicks - Neighbor’s Corner becomes a corner community for regulars and newcomers alike.  Tl;dr as promised: fantastic coffee/tea, made by kind, passionate people. A one of a kind coffeeshop in the city and a gem for the neighborhood."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"The drinks are magnificent eg strawberry matcha latte. The food is fabulous eg Turkey avocado sandwich. The pastries are top class eg sesame seed mochi muffin. Most of all, Maya, Kazuma and team are amazing people that have brought so much passion and warmth to the whole neighborhood. So many regulars who now know each other and it’s all down to the wonderful people running this magical neighborhood, corner, cafe 🥰"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"No better cup of coffee in a miles’ radius. You must make your way to this beautiful coffee shop with exceptional design and even a better taste for beans. This coffee shop helps elevate SF’s coffee scene (Aussies, if you know, you know)"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Can’t recommend this coffee shop enough. It’s location is nestled away which really adds to the neighborhood vibes. The coffee is fantastic and the staff are so friendly and really spend their time crafting each drink to perfection. My go-to is an oat milk latte (hot or iced). It’s a popular spot for remote workers which can make finding a seat sometimes difficult but I usually prefer sitting outside on their benches in the sun or continuing my walk over to Kite Hill.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Stopped in while visiting family in the area. Saturday morning with a baby stroller - there were lots of other babies there and everyone was so friendly! Felt like a friendly place to hang out before other spots opened. Their hojicha latte and fresh strawberry mochi was also amazing!
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"It’s hands down the best coffee in Noe Valley/Castro area, they use beans from Hedge, who are experts in espresso. There’s a strong Japanese influence/feeling when you are inside, from tamago sandwiches, amazing teas, to specialized literature about coffee culture in Japan."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Amazing sandwich (turkey avo club) and vanilla latte (so thick and creamy). My husband got the matcha strawberry latte and Japanese rolled omelette sandwich. The people there gave incredible, friendly service. The man making the drinks takes such care and pays such attention to detail. Nice ambiance and easily found a table. Will definitely be back often!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Highly recommend Neighbor’s Corner. Incredibly friendly owner, Maya, who has cultivated a warm and inviting atmosphere. Excellent drinks, prepared well and efficiently. Worth going to the area just for the cafe. Will be back!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Bad experience eating there at lunch today, it took a good 35 minutes to prepare 3 poor bagels. No communication, no apologies but even more so, no care preparing them. The tomato slice was almost as thick as the bagel. Besides, the size of the bagel is ridiculous for the $15 price tag tax and tip included. Cute place and convenient to have this around the neighborhood but I will walk further next time I need a quick and filling lunch."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"A gem of a cafe that is perfect for your mind. Awesome people who totally know what they are doing, not only in terms of drinks and food, but also the choice of music (played at just the right volume), the cleanliness of the bathroom, Pretty much everything I can think of. Very impressed. Thank you for being here."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Went here for the first time during their one year anniversary! What an amazing vibe! Super child friendly - it does justice to its name!!! Got a shirt so I can rep’ it around the world!!!
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Their bagel breakfast sandwich is an art and so delicious 🤤♥️ give it a try And if you like Matcha you would love their matcha strawberry latte …
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"cute neighborhood spot. first time there i ordered a bagel which took super long and was not good (disclaimer I’m a new yorker, but still). but then my next time they gave me a free scone bc of the wait, they are very sweet people and the coffee is good. genuinely feels neighborly"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,I’m so thankful that this coffee shop is here. Favorite part of my morning.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Probably my favorite coffee shop. Truly a neighborhood place, and everyone who works there is just wonderful. The coffee is delicious, the seating comfortable, and the atmosphere is always peaceful and friendly.  Almost always some friendly dogs excited for their free treat, too!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Cute cute cute and great coffee. In love with the almond croissant 🥐 You must go!
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Exceptional service—truly notable. Staff is totally friendly, gracious, and anticipated your needs.  Hospitality level was that of a fancy restaurant, rather than a neighborhood cafe.  The important stuff: coffee and toast were delicious and perfectly prepared.  Bonus: tastefully curated retail items, including matsutake salt (!) and mistletoe ($1!)"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,My favorite place for many things. Especially the cold brew.  3 month update - It’s become my favorite cafe in San Francisco. Thank you Neighbor’s.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Loved it here! Friendly service, excellent lattes. The avocado toast was nothing to write home about but did the job and was a good vegan option (hold the cheese) in a pinch. The ambiance would be great to work in (saw outlets and table space, but am not sure about wifi)"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"This is a really cozy and quiet coffee shop that serves delicious pastry bites, tasty coffee and matcha lattes! I tried matcha latte with oats milk with mochi muffin! Great combo!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Cute place and good coffee. I ordered a latte and the barista was gracious and accommodating when I changed it from hot to iced at the last minute (after paying). (Ugh, indecision on a warm winter day!)"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,I love this cafe! One of my favorites since moving out here to San Francisco. I got the matcha strawberry latte and it was sooo good! The taller man making the drinks was very meticulous. I loved how much respect and care he puts into making the drinks. Highly recommend you stop by and check this cafe out.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Amazing customer service.  The food was extremely fresh and tasty.  Lovely place for a quiet breakfast.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Excellent cold brew and mochi daifuku this morning. Sometimes the wait here is a bit too long but not often.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Neighbor's corner is the little coffee shop everyone needs. It's a quaint, bright, cozy space. The baristas are dedicated to their craft and provide exceptional drinks. The espresso is not the most complex or unique but it is subtle, smooth and mellow in the most positive ways; it is easily drinkable by itself. The food in also unreal, my wife and I had a breakfast sandwich and the bread is just something out of this world.  For such a low key presentation, the service, craft and quality surely do all the talking for this neighborhood gem."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"After they opened about 7? years ago, my partner and tried the place. The 8 ounce coffee, 8 ounce mocha, undersized donut and undersized scone 7 years ago came to $16. The mocha was disgusting, I don't know how they got that so wrong. I won't ever go back, partly on principle. The place epitomzes the ""New San Francisco"" - all sleek and designed, full of overpaid workers completely socially disconnected with each other, and overpriced product that is not necessarily better in quality. But the biggest reason is - we need a corner store, like was there. I hate this place and it's whole fake friendly vibe. Ugh"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Great neighborhood spot! They have new ownership it seems and they’re super sweet. So far they seemed to have added to the menu. They’ve kept the cute/airy/welcoming vibe, the pastries are great, and the hojicha latte is one of my faves. I definitely recommend it!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Great local spot for a snack and coffee. Did was good and service was warm.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Hidden gem! Cafe menu classics with a Japanese twist: try the mochi muffins, breakfast sandwiches and matcha drinks. Be greeted by the loveliest staff and a true neighborhood vibe."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Food and coffee is good, but it can take 30-45 minutes to get a coffee sometimes"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,My favorite local joint! Their matcha is delicious as are their pastries and sandwiches. Vibe inside is cozy and peaceful and the staff is wonderfully welcoming and kind. Also they have Wi-Fi and outlets!
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,NEW owner! Awesome coffee place! High quality coffee and great sandwiches. Everything they do is with love to detail and perfection :)  P.s. they changed owners a few months (older reviews might be outdated)
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Absolutely lovely neighborhood coffee shop. We are always greeted with a smile. The drip coffee is delicious and breakfast sandwiches are EGGCELLENT. So grateful to have these sweet folks.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Very cute cafe tucked into the neighborhood. Great place to have a quick bite and coffee or relax and work for a few hours.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Lovely staff and excellent tea. Would like to try more of their food. Will definitely go back.  Morning crowd is super quiet though, like a library"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Edit - new owners and it's now my favorite cafe in SF.  --------- It's a coin toss as to whether they're actually serving breakfast sandwiches - would not recommend going if you'll be unhappy not getting it. Consistently good coffee.  My recommendation would be to commit to a breakfast schedule or post daily when serving breakfast.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Great Japanese treats and drinks in a space that's charming despite the semi-rude tech clientele.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Fantastic neighborhood coffee shop. Great espresso, and the friendliest team. I look forward to it every day!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"This cafe is adorable and the people are so nice. great coffee, outlets and space if you want to work and a truly delicious egg sandwich."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,I openly challenge anyone to find me a better oatmilk latte
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Rented a car to come and try this place that I had been eyeing since pre-pandemic times. We arrived and all of the four seating spots are occupied by laptop people. No additional seating indoors and no seating outdoors. Staff seemed annoyed and indifferent about our presence and definitely did not seem very interested in having us as customers, like they wanted us to leave. In fact, this staff came across like the rudest staff I have yet met here in SF, such a weird experience. Ended up going elsewhere and will most likely not return. A shame, this could have been a nice spot."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Ok, three things: great coffee, cute ceramics and lovely served food. Amazing and cozy little place!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Neighbor's Corner manages to be tasteful, understated and local. There is not a wide selection of treats, but they are all super delicious. There's some careful chosen retail items on one wall. The coffee is excellent and the tea is served loose in a nice glass pot. It's really a pleasant environment to chat with a friend or sit and chill. Their occasional Wednesday pop up dinner menus are also well worth indulging!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Wow the coffee is so good here.  It’s a little bit slow (generally just 2 people working the counter) but it’s worth the wait.  Also really nice vibe inside.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Great people, great staff, great coffee"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Nice place but the service is sooooo slow. I had to wait over 20 minutes for espresso.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Coffee is amazing & so are the people working there! Can’t wait to be back! Also yummy fresh sandwiches and pastries.. and the window seats so charming! ☕️🌞 …
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Had to go here few times and same result each time - burnt bitter coffee, extremely hot. So pretty much anything you can do wrong with espresso and milk for latte/cappuccino - is done wrong. I would be the everyday visitor if only this place can do smth about it and make coffee at least “okay”"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Fire Cortados, sun angles are great (south facing windows), very nice baristabros, internet is unbelievably fast and great outlet game. No crazy people/tents outside (yet) and a surplus of pettable dogs make this a top-tier destination for people that like to work in peace.  Warning: The water in bathroom runs hotter than the sun and will burn you.  Warning 2: They seem to stock about 3 bagels per week and as a bagel boy this is extremely saddening. I didn’t dock a star because not everyone cares about bagels."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"I've been coming here several times a week and loved it: great tea, coffee, pastries and super friendly staff. Great place to meet friends, read, work.  Unfortunately, they've recently changed the table setup to fit more people- the small space now feels too tight and crowded, and the new stools are uncomfortable. It's not my go-to anymore, unfortunately 🙁"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Wow this little corner coffee shop is just awesome! They have specialty drinks there's that I never would have imagined until I went there today. I had the tumeric latte.  That was made with ginger, some goat milk and other ingredients, man was it awesome!  My friend for the matcha latte, and I tried a couple sips just to confirm that it was good but it wasn't...only because it was AMAZING!!  Such a uniquely perfect addition to my wake up ceremony.  =^_^="
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,This is my afternoon coffee go to spot in San Francisco. Excellent coffee and friendly proprietor.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"They just do everything right here. The food, the service, the ambience. Truly a wonderful place."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Super cute neighborhood coffee shop in a quieter part of town. Come in for the delicious coffee and pastries and stay for the zen vibes. Or grab your latte and walk over to kite hill nearby for a daytime date.  Everyone’s always friendly. Baristas are helpful and polite.  Just get there before 4. They close early.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Awesome vibe and really good coffee and pastries. The people here are so friendly and make a mean coffee. Their pastries are also incredible. Overall an awesome place to hang out and get some work done or chat.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"An adorable neighborhood coffee shop with great sun light, super friendly staff, and high-quality coffee and matcha drinks."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Solid coffee and a great selection of Japanese teas. The shop has a friendly neighborhood vibe.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Cozy local coffee shop with a small selection of pastries and the best avocado toast in the city.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Owners are sweet and attentive to all their customers. Best cold brew I've had! They walked us through their process and it's clear they take put a high value on quality. They dont cut any corners. Highly recommend!
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,Two stars purely for location. Millennial attitude workers and all that’s wrong with SF post Covid. Empty shop and never open during posted hours is a prime example of what’s wrong with this place. Another good one bites the dust.
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Another amazing find steps away from my place! Cute little cafe with ample sunlight. Perfect way to spend your day if you plan to work on your laptop - it's got a nice vibe, and they have WiFi."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"So friendly, with fantastic coffee and delicious treats for morning and lunch. On Wednesdays they do a rotating pop-up dinner service, with restaurants and chefs from around the City offering take-home dinners (have to order in advance!)."
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Neighbor's was a much needed addition to Noe Valley. Friendly owners, good espresso (Andytown), along with a rotating selection of food and home goods. Addition of pour over options for fresher drip coffee would turn this place into a 5 star!"
Neighbor's Corner,499 Douglass St,"Everything is delicious, and the owner is phenomenally sweet and friendly. Their bread and sandwiches are out of this world!"
