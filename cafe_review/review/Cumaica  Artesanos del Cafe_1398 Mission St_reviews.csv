Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"when two people are working it's great the service but when the Latin Lady is by herself she is rude and doesn't know how to serve each person first. I ordered a Mocha and a piece of cake. No one was waiting so I ordered. Then a Latin Lady comes after me. (I'M AFRICAN AMERICAN) She orders and is given coffee n something, then she takes a guy then another. I say excuse me my Mocha . She responded In helping other people hold in don't worry. Her voice was loud and tone was rude. I got my drink after 7 mins later. I won't come here again. I'll stay going to Starbucks."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,1st time at this location since it opened years ago! I think of them as Martha Bros. Same family different name. Same GREAT ☕️ mmm. The people watchinf is the best from this window. I SWEAR!
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Yummy coffee.  They make really good mochas.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Cumaica Artesanos del Cafe is located behind the SF. Twitter headquarters. The location is great for an immersive sit in to enjoy their good coffee, pastries, pasta salad, and free Wi-Fi. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The SFMTA Mission 14 bus passes in front of the Cafe."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Can’t start my day without a Mexican mocha and Salvadoran quesadilla from here. 🥹♥️ …
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Good coffee, friendly staff.  I just had my second visit, and was impressed with both the coffee and food options -- moderate selection but very well curated.  Really nice vibe, great music choices."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Friendly employees, good quality coffee."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"This place has amazing coffee! I live super close by and have never walked in until today, but glad I did! I honestly didn’t even realize it was a coffee shop, but the inside was nothing like the outside. Super cute and everything looked delicious, and great prices for SF."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Awesome coffee to juice you up for a nice bike ride
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"One of a handful in the area that open early, fast service, & friendly staff. I fell in love with their iced latte sweetened w/ brown sugar, the turkey pesto sandwich,  & the chia pudding parfait!! The rest of their grab-n-go Cafe items look delicious as well!!"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Amazing and inexpensive coffee, hospitable and polite staffs, could be improved environment"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"I really like this place. I used to go there everyday when I was studying nearby. Today, I go sometimes to get a great coffee and  fruit's cake. The staff are really friendly and helpful. You can have great coffees out there for cheaper than other places."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"My co-workers and I love this place. Nice customer service; lots of working people visit this place; good environment and location;  fresh pastries, juices, coffee; everything is excellent. The owner is very nice as well as his helpers.  I recommend it to everyone."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Can't put my finger about this place on what's missing. Had pastries and capuchino, tasted good."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Great coffee (house cup) and a nice selection of eats to accompany it. Very personable service too makes it my ""go to"" coffee house on Clement Street!"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Although they're across the street from a franchise competitor this place can hold it's own. The coffee is robust, the pastries are fit for anyone who loves locally baked goods. If you have to make a decision when you're across the street don't hesitate and cross the street to Cumaica."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"I like to grab a coffee at Cumeica. The staff is friendly and I like to support the locals. The coffee is great and hot, it's important to say, I knew some coffee shops they made only warm coffees. The banana bread is yummy."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Was a nice place to take a break. Clean bathroom too. The coffee was stronger than I like but that's the trend these days
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,I was there for a work related meeting. Coffee taste is fine although the tables aren't clean all the time. Wifi is really slow but you can sit there as long as you like. There is another Cumaica coffee in Mission street (south part) and I like that one better. They can make the atmospher warmer and friendlier with a simple re decoratation.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"A big, sunny spot, with caffeine served cold or hot from Nicaragua.  Wandered in here for a quick breakfast and drink.  Standard options for caffeine consumption are available (I went with my usual Mocha Frappe - it was really good and reasonably priced at $4 for 20oz.).  I also had an asiago bagel with egg, cheese, and ham (also ~$4).  There weren't a ton of bagel options, and bacon and sausage were sadly absent from the menu.  The atmosphere was really great here, though.  High vaulted ceilings and a relatively open layout give it a roomy feel.  It wasn't hard to find a table in the morning.  Be warned, though, there was a ton of sunlight in the morning since the large glass walls face south.  This cuts the available seating without intense sunlight in half.  Fortunately, like Superman, I draw my strength from the Sun. #OneSmallStep"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Worst place we’ve had in SF so far. Restrooms out of order and no offering to use the employee restrooms. Though price of products are alright, this was a major disappointment."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Cozy little coffee place. Very nice employees.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"I go to this spot a lot. Good coffee, relaxed atmosphere, really easy to pop-in, and great location."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Was headed to Peet's as I needed a relatively quiet place to do some work, ran into Cumaica Coffee.  I'm glad I did, the caramel Mac was just the right amount of bitter sweet.  Highly recommended"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Great folks, good coffee, tasty baked stuff."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Cumaica is always great. They make great Esspreso or any type of Late. Mexican Late with Almond Milk is awesome. Good thing is their coffee or non coffee drinks are not too sweet or with too much sugar.  On hot days the iced drinks or blended cold drinks are my favorite. A blended Matcha Lata with Almond milk is always good on a hot day.  We also buy or coffee beans here as they have great blends.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Great coffee shop with a chill vibe, decent prices, good coffee, wifi, and good music. I'll be back."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Great place!  Very good coffee, good pastries and bagels, really nice people who work there, and spacious feel.  It is a warm and inviting coffee shop."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,The breakfast is the best and coffee is great the workers really cool
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,This place is amazing. They have phone charging batteries to use while you are enjoying one of their delicious coffees. The hot or iced Moca with Mexican chocolate is delicious.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"This is a four-star place if your top priority isn't the quality of the coffee. Good food offerings, really friendly people, open at convenient hours and altogether a good experience. Just not quite the same level of beans as ritual, four barrel Etc"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Good coffee and bagel sandwiches, but pretty much the same as others in the area. Nothing special really stands out to review about."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,I collect best places to spend my $ when I wfh- this is only 1hr of wifi. Should've just went to Peet's but the reviews were high  Bagel mediocre and coffee could get anywhere  If you need a quick one great - otherwise go to Philz/ Peet's anywhere else to spend the day
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,I found this coffee shop when walking on Clement for its Sunday farmer's market.  It's a small cafe with some unique coffee drinks.  I had an ice mocha which was great.  The drink was freshly made (no powder) and the espresso was strong.  Not too much chocolate to make it overly sweet.  Overall a good option if you are around the area.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Great coffee. Friendly staff. Hugz
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Feels like a vast lobby because of high ceilings. Good, fast cafe from Nicaragua with reasonable prices. Also has bagels and sandwiches and pre-made stuff. Friendly Spanish-American baristas."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"I've grabbed coffee or ice tea here a number of times and can't think of a single standout moment. The coffee is fine, the lattes aren't and the ice tea decent. There's a lot of food for the taking, but I've just never eaten here. If you're desperate for caffeine go for it, otherwise walk a few blocks,  you'll find better."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Great breakfast snack options. Coffee is great. I always get an iced coffee. Service is great! Support small local businesses!
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Friendly service and the two times I've been here the Americano has been above average.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Got the iced mocha, great! Service was fast and they were very friendly."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,I love the people who work here. Make me feel good and happy.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Delicious breakfast burritos, excellent coffee and friendly staff."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Had a whole milk double latte.  Good foam, good flavor.  Nice."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Used to love coming here and still do. But the service has lacked. I waited almosy 20 min for a mexican mocha. The handle a bunch of people that came after me and now im late for aork. Unexceptable. Ive always loved the drink here tho. Ive never experienced this till today. Ben coming for at least 2 or 3 years.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,The Bomb!!! Highly recommended
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Very friendly staff and quick service. Reasonable price for food and good coffee :) yum yum!
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Reasonable prices, but the quality of the coffee drinks isn't as consistent as it used to be when the young man made the drinks."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Let's just say the 3rd time was NOT a charm.  And neither were the attitudes of the baristas.  I will gladly walk further and pay more, for a pleasant experience."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"The place itself is okay, a bit shabby. Appreciated the willingness to make an iced earl grey tea with honey for me, which wasn't on the menu."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Really nice place to have a coffee. The staff are super friendly.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Awesome staff, good coffee..."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Likable and good coffees. Next to twitter, sf FitnessSF, Twitter's little apartment tower cross the street, good weed club too. Nice Portegese name...."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Very good coffee. I truly enjoyed every morning. Must try their Lox (salmon) bagel.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Sadly inflation seems to have hit the most elementary:  No longer the best, sadly changed Oatmilk to the Kirkland brand which has a terrible after taste in a cortado.  I tried making them at home with this brand and they tasted just as bad as they do here. Sadly they have nice coffee but it takes a beating with this cheep substitute.   This is the second time I have tried here but alas unless getting real milk, taste has now been devalued.  When going to a coffee house, coffee taste should be the number one concern, especially for a $4.50, four oz drink, the smoothness is gone and so am I.  3 years ago:   I’m a Cortado drinker and Cumaica is superb in quality, taste, and most importantly, no matter who makes the drink, consistency!  Down to earth staff with excellent taste in beans and roasting!  They are surrounded by coffee outlets but this is the place I chose when I’m home."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"The coffee is too good to be true!  Robert Guerrero, founder of this sweet coffee shop is top-notch. The staff is so sweet, especially Ellie, who keeps Cumaica running in an inviting & friendly atmosphere.  I love this place!"
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Friendly staff, awesome workspace. I prefer Cumaica over Peet's, which is across the street."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could - their house coffee is good, and their staff friendly. Food is pretty average fare, although I like their Pumpkin Cheesecake Pound Cake. Their wi-fi policy is really inconsistent - the first time I bought a coffee/bagel I got 100 minutes, then the next time 52.  I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but it's a decent spot for a cup of coffee if you're passing through."
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,Nice corner coffee with choices of bagel.
Cumaica  Artesanos del Cafe,1398 Mission St,"Cumaica is top-notch for coffee drinks and grab and go items. The staff are multilingual,  courteous,  patient and professional."
