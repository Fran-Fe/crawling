Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"This Bluestone Lane cafe is located inside the same building as the Emblem Hotel. It is accessible through a separate door. The cafe is small with limited opportunity to sit down and drink your coffee there. When the weather permits there is outdoor seating available, but there are only a few tables available, and they are right on the sidewalk of Sutter Street, so it can be noisy. The staff at this Bluestone Lane cafe was very accommodating, knowledgeable, and helpful. We enjoyed being in the cafe and the drinks were delivered quite quickly. We will definitely come back to this cafe."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"Great avocado toast! My chai latte was better than I expected. It could be more spicy and less sweet. I would say it's a little better than Starbucks, at least, and AFAIK the best option in the Union Square area. They have non dairy milk, including oat."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"Good coffee, of the standard one is accustomed to back in Australia, but pricey - the small 2-shot Piccolo with oatmilk was $6. Starbucks' larger $6 3-shot oat latte is better value but lower on flavour. I brought my keep cup but they used a disposable and transferred it, which defeated the purpose. The tip prompt at the payment station is definitely un-Australian :-)"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"Coffee moca and chai tea were sadly not so great, Fresh brew coffee a block away had Way better taste.  The blueberry muffin was most excellent."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"Excellent place to take a breakfast! Crunchy croissant, good capuchino, and excellent avocado toast with Prosciutto Benedict eggs! Beautiful decoration! 100%"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,Lovely cozy spot. Great service. Good breakfast options and great coffee. Nice airy feel with lots of light.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"Lately the food is not as good it was at first. Portions are a lot smaller than they used to be(e.g. rainbow bowl). The place is always full of trash, and it's a little too pricey for the type of service. This morning I had to wait 20 minutes for a latte, had to leave and come back to pick it up. And when I got to the office, I realized it had a white hair sticking on the edge of the cup. What a dissapointment! Money and time wasted."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,by far the BEST avocado 🥑-Toast I‘ve ever tried before !!! And best Iced dirty chai latte - wow!! 💚 The staff is so friendly and lovely!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,In one word — amazing! Great toasts and coffee. Friendly staff. Very clean. Bonus: right next to a hotel that has some great selfie spots.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"My favorite coffee shop in SF, especially for South Africans reminds me of home."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,Great coffee shop with healthy toasts. Loved the oatmilk latte.   Extra seating in the connect hotel was very cozy.  Visited multiple times on our trip!
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"Great cup of black coffee. Not sour like Starbucks, incredibly mellow and smooth. Will definitely come back. Only gave 4 stars cause their machine to order is slow AF"
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,Best Avocado toast with egg I have had in years! The coffee is on point too.
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"service was fine everyone was nice, however they were one of the only locations in SF i had been rejected the use of cash and had to use my card. with that being said i do not recommend the food or coffee from here, for the coffee tasted watered down and burnt, the avocado toast was alright for the most part but the lemon on it was a bit much (me being a full time chef) and had been unnecessarily served to me in a togo container, meaning they could have used tableware. the person i was with did enjoy their salmon toast, but were equally as unimpressed with the coffee. i had also gotten a small $6 +t fruit cup that had a few moldy raspberries. call me picky but if you ask me youre better off going to starbucks over this place for breakfast."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,"It was 2019 that I called by on my visit from Australia and it was good to have a coffee ""just like at home"". In normal times, Australian and USA coffee cultures are quite different. Prices expensive by Australian standards but you are talking about the Union Square area of downtown San Francisco."
Bluestone Lane Theatre District Coffee Shop,562 Sutter St,Came here around 10:45 on a Friday and ordered online and was told our order would be ready at 11:13. Our cold brews came out really quickly (but a dash of oat milk is more like a 1/4 oat milk) - not a huge issue. 1:13 came and went and at about 1:35 we noticed someone who ordered after us grabbed two boxes of food (okay no problem hers came out first). A few minutes later we heard someone saying “this isn’t my order” so we looked and she had two open boxes of food at the counter. They took them and then closed them and called out my name. Those two boxes of food were taken away from the counter/kitchen and opened by a stranger who was unwatched and then returned and given to us. The food should have been remade without question.  The two items were an avocado toast and a salmon toast - neither of which had any resemblance of warm. Seemed like toast that was cooked last night. So we had cold soft toast that had been in a strangers possession - I will never return here.
