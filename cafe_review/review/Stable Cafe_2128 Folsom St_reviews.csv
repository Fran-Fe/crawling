Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Oh my! I loved this place!! 😋 Straightforward and courteous service, an inviting and lovely space and the best part - their food and beverages!  I tried the Avocado toast without the cheese & the London Fog with almond milk - they were both yummy! 😋😋 My companion liked their matcha beverage as well as the egg toast. The place itself is very pretty - with a lot of plants and paintings! They’ve outdoor seating in the ‘secret garden’ as well! I’ll go back here on my next visit to SFO! 🙂  Parking may get tricky - so, I’d recommend going in here early."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Stable Cafe is great. The food and service are perfect. The coffee is perfect. This morning I had a perfect Americano and a perfect fried egg sandwich with bacon. If only Stable Cafe could be magically transported to a charming location instead of San Francisco. Stable Cafe is great. It's almost got a country vibe to the place. I love the peach trees in the backyard.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Ordered inside and had options of sitting inside on the first floor or on the loft or outside in the garden. There is good wind coverage even for a fairly windy day. Iced and drip coffee were great. Would not get an iced matcha latte again as the proportions were a bit off.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,What an incredible place to enjoy the company of friends! The outdoor space is very cozy and inviting. The food is wonderful and the staff are incredibly kind and helpful. I can't say enough good things about this cafe. They also make an excellent cappuccino. Can't wait to go back!!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Gorgeous cafe with a lovely outdoor patio and a two-level interior filled with plants-galore.  Had the overnight oats and the grilled breakfast sandwich. Both absolutely delicious with unique ingredients that make it a cut above standard brunch food. Only downer is the price, but you get what you pay for.  Highly recommended."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"First of all, I like the garden style seating with both shades and sunlight. Definitely a cool place to sit and hang out. But more than that, the food and the coffee! I followed my friend and ordered the salad with a fancy name called Panzanella with a bit of skepticism. I was hungry and speculate that I won't be satisfied. However, the salad is rich and light at the same time. I think the light dressing and raisin makes it light, but the roasted vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, broccolini, and croutons make it filling. The herbs also made the difference in this dish. The coffee (latte) is smooth, not acidic or bitter, so up to you if you'd like it this way. In any event, solid cafe that is worth visiting again."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great cafe with wonderful outdoor seating options. Coffee was excellent and staff were friendly and accommodating.  Would come back for sure.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Super cute cafe with awesome breakfast options. Drip coffee was delicious and so was the lemon aioli breakfast sandwich. Overnight oats weren’t my favorite but still good! Highly recommend. Plenty of outdoor seating and a few tables inside
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Service can vary here/they've gotten weirdly stingy. When ordering, I asked for the cheese on the side of the Salmon Tartine but, they replied ""it's a lot easier on the kitchen if we don't have to put in edits,"" clearly annoyed. When the food was delivered, my buddy asked asked for some extra sauce for his dish, and the food runner said he would have to go back inside to the register to order it and pay $1. So weird.  Food is pretty good, I'd say lightly overpriced since they upped prices during the pandemic. The reason to come here is the space itself--it's gorgeous."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Superb ambiance! This place is so cute and very well put together. We had lox 🥯 for breakfast and it was so delicious, the americano coffee was average but overall happy with what we got. I recommend:) (I took a bite of my bagel and ate some of the fruits before the picture 😅)  I want to mention that I almost rated the place 4 stars, and the one star deduction would be due to the price to portion value, I believe it should be couple dollars cheaper."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"My $18 breakfast.  Oh joy. It was tasty enough, but I’ve had better.   Coffee was luke warm and Staff were cold.  I felt like I was more a bother than a customer."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great cafe! Love their food. The chicken salad sandwich and egg sandwiches are great!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great coffee! (Oat milk latte) Tried the breakfast sandwich with avocado and it was good, too, not spectacular but good. The best park of Stable is the outdoor courtyard...gorgeous! Plenty of tables, lush with plants, and ample shade."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Coffee and plants? Best place ever!! The food is pricey, but honestly, it was worth it"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"We came here for brunch, the atmosphere is so green and calm. You should definitely get the avocado toast! You can add an egg to it as well. Not many food options though"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Such a cool spot. Great sandwiches and awesome coffee. Great atmosphere. Only negative is that everybody else knows how cool it is too so get ready for a little bit of a wait (which is definitely worth your while)
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Really cute space with lots of seating. I'd say it's good for groups and a place worth checking out. It's not a sit-down restaurant, you order, take a number and they bring your food to you. I've only been once and tried 1 drink and breakfast item so my feedback is limited on the menu. I think they have a pretty good menu that has something for everyone. Simple but good. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I think some of their items are overpriced for basic breakfasts that you can make at home. Regardless, I'd still come back for the nice atmosphere and outdoor seating."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"5 stars for the outdoor seating/ambiance but 3 stars for the food. The outdoor seating is spacious and peaceful with lots of plants; an oasis in the city.  Food is counter service. Drip coffee was good but the breakfast sandwich and burrito were very basic, which we knew when we ordered them. However, if you’re going to do something basic like that, every ingredient needs to be spot on. The bacon in the sandwich was not cooked enough to be easy to bite off and the burrito only had undercooked potatoes and no other ingredients besides the eggs."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great vibes and decor but won’t be able to say the same thing for coffee, just got americano and it’s 2/5"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,I've always loved Stable but today? MIND BLOWN with the balance and uniqueness of flavors in the new summer rice bowl. Lots a veg bowls in my Bay Area life to date and holy s#$* WTactualF?! Nice job chef!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great atmosphere outside in the back! Although not so happy with the food so far. I had the kale Caesar salad. The salad was ok with the dressing but the added chicken tasted like it was processed and not very fresh or “cut from the bone” also they only took Venmo so I’m wondering if they are trying to skip the credit card charges.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"overall, nice cafe with a great atmosphere to catch up with friends on a weekend brunch!  the bagel with smoked salmon was decent. nothing to complain about but nothing that blows your mind. all of the food options are standard american brunch/snack items"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"We had a dinner celebration here after our elopement and we cannot say enough about the venue, food and staff. Karen and her team did such a fabulous job accommodating us and making the event so special. Our family can't stop talking about how good the pizza and grazing table was (and presentation is on point). All the food is locally sourced with in-season ingredients. The venue itself is so beautiful and it was perfect timing with the trees blossoming during our event. Karen was very supportive, easy-going, communicative and helpful during the entire process to ensure all went smoothly. Thank you for everything! We hope you guys do pizza nights so we can come back for more! (photo credit: Sarowly Photo)"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great place for a coffee and a good read. The outdoor patio is very nice and relaxing. I went in for brunch. Stayed there for a while since it’s the prefect spot for reading! Loved all the plants. Definitely coming back to read, work or just hang out!  Food I had the chilaquiles which come with refried beans, bacon and two over easy eggs. The chilaquiles where good not too spicy, and they use chipotle for the salsa."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Strolled by after a dance class and got utterly distracted by the gorgeous lush garden. Turns out to be workshop of local garden artist attached to a cafe. The beautifully curated playlist of world music fits with the tranquil vibe perfectly. Staff are cool; coffee is nice. The only flaw is one will easily zone out in the gentle breeze,browsing the ubiquitous succulent or guessing what the French-speaking couple next table are romantically chatting about."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Good affordable drip coffee. Lovely owner and staff. No wifi or power points (on purpose for now), but nice for working. Beautiful calm space with huge pretty garden. Many seats inside and out."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"What an incredibly gorgeous place to grab a good cup of coffee. The outside patio is beautiful and lush with plants. Unfortunately, there's no WiFi - otherwise I'd be here all day (probably the point of no WiFi). There's a covered back area with a long dining table and oven. I can only imagine the kind of beautiful outdoor events they hold here. We were asked to leave early for an event, and when we walked past later it turned out to be a wedding!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Way too expensive, and very small portion. I took the Fried Egg Sandwich, 16$ with tax and tips, and it was very small, no side, no presentation, and no service. You can find much better very close if you want to have a lunch."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"A tucked away little gem on a quite street in the Mission. Gorgeous side yard with a large collection of succulents. Visited on a warm spring day when the trees are in full bloom. Chill atmosphere, friendly staff and good coffee. Excellent aqua Fresca."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Not a lot of seating available but the Brie toast was delish. Vanilla latte didn’t taste much of a vanilla latte. Customer service was really nice! Busy on a Sunday morning brunch. Outside seating available with lots of space.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Coffee was really good. Limited options for vegans - adapted avocado test or vegetable bagel with pesto instead of cream cheese. Main appeal of this place is how peaceful it is and all the indoor and outdoor sitting. Nice decor and friendly staff as well!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great coffee and brunch was so yum! And prices are cheap which is great and very unusual to sf!! Aesthetic of the backyard is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite brunch/breakfast places in sf!!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Coffee was excellent. Scrambled eggs are consistently good every time I visit, and the bacon was crispy. The food comes out quickly, and I love their contactless payment system.  I'm also pleased by the presentation of the food: it's minor, but the seasonal fruit is a nice touch."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,The host met me at the gate omw to NERT training! I can't wait to try their pre fixe menu. It rotates daily! How exciting! I will bring my hubby next weekend.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Really nice cafe - wasn’t busy on a Sunday, amazing lattes, tasty food, cozy backyard, great music, friendly baristas."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Come here for the beautiful, dog-friendly patio!! We got the mushroom-gruyère pastry, a nitro cold brew and a dirty chai. I really liked the creaminess of the nitro cold brew and the chai latte was solid as well. The pastry was very yummy but definitely would have been better warm! They also serve quite a large food menu which I will definitely try next time.  Parking was kind of difficult (mid-day on a Wednesday) and there is no WiFi here though so be prepared to read a book or just hang out :) I will definitely be coming back here - the ambiance alone is worth it!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"With journal in hand, I found the perfect spot at one of those tables. The surrounding beauty inspired my imagination, and felt a deep connection to the natural world around me. The fruit trees stood as silent witnesses, bearing witness to the introspective moments and providing a gentle backdrop for contemplations.  As I took a sip of the coffee, its warmth spread through my body, invigorating senses. The rich, bold flavor awakened my taste buds, adding a touch of indulgence to the experience. And although it was just a simple veggie bagel, its flavors mingled harmoniously, providing a satisfying combination of textures and tastes."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Food 4 (breakfast & lunch variety 5). Coffee 3. Atmosphere 4 (barn door, loft, fruit tree garden). Service 4. Unique, relaxed, friendly, quality joint to chill out or have brunch with friends. No WiFi."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Super nice atmosphere, especially outside. They play lofi beats (not too loud). Plenty of space with high tables and greenery in the patio. Great place to do work on a nice day. WiFi too :)  Eggs with grilled veggies and avocado were exactly what I wanted"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Nice coffee shop with a great big outside patio. Not the biggest fan of the food options. Chilaquiles were good and chicken salad sandwich was ok.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Food and ambiance are good, but one of the baristas is extremely rude and condescending. Not sure if he was having a bad day or what, but I did not have a good experience. Not coming back."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Beautiful spot to visit. Breakfast is fabulous. Honestly one of the best places to go on a sunny day.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,First time visiting this place for a wedding shower. Didn't eat any of the food they provided there. I got an iced latte which was on the pricey side for a small drink. The atmosphere was great. The outdoor seating area was nice.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Yummy coffee, friendly service, chill environment. What more could you ask for?  Stable offers a breakfast and lunch menu along with small bites. Plenty of seating outdoors and indoors. Most seating indoors is annoyingly occupied by laptop users but there is a ton of outdoor seating.  If you’re looking for a quick stop to run in and grab a coffee...this is not the spot for you. If you’re looking for a coffee shop where you can sit and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee and socialize, then I recommend checking this place out."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Lovely outside spot to sit in the sun. Coffee was nice and my hazelnut pastry was huge and delicious. Could have easily spent more time here
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Definitely one of my favorite cafes in SF. Love all the plants and outdoor seatings.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Cute, little cafe a few mins away from work. Lovely decor and ambiance. The chicken panini was yummy, and the staff were very nice too. Want to try that savory biscuit next."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Amazing place for breakfast or brunch. There is an open space thats perfect for the meal. They offer tasty fresh food, I highly recomen the svocado toast or the Luna (amazing bagle sandwich). Its a place to go with family or friends or to have some work done."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Good coffee and food. Plus there’s a beautiful patio garden with plenty of seating. Highly recommend it!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Quick counter service on a Saturday morning. The red brick patio filled with trees and plants makes a beautiful breakfast setting that feels intimate even when filled with diners. The chicken panini and breakfast wrap were both delicious, and the cucumber and citrus agua fresca was excellent."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great coffee and outdoor space is nice and serene. Great for a casual hangout with friends, a good reading space and is dog friendly!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Lovely little cafe, cute outdoor seating, good coffee and fantastic food combo with fresh fruits here :)"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Cute little cafe. Yummy coffee. Avocado toast with an entire avocado. Literally avocado and toast. $5. Exactly what I needed. :) sat here to do some work while enjoying my coffee. Good place to people watch as well. There is outdoor seating as well in the courtyard.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great place for morning meetings. Dog friendly. Unusual setting but dont let the bright yellow garage doors frighten you.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Happened upon this place by accident. A haven of rural, stylish calm on Folsom, a semi industrial and edgy part of the city. The cappuccino I had was divine! Service was warm and smiley. I’ll definitely be back!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great spot! Unfortunately prices have nearly doubled since a year ago :(
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,AMAZING spot to hang out with friends or read! There’s a huge outdoor area with lots of tables and chairs. Highly recommend!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Neighborhood gem for breakfast! Fair prices, delicious classic dishes, and a good ambiance. Outdoor seating is great"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Love this cafe. Great atmosphere, artwork, music, food collection.  However $4.75 for a latte??!! ""Everything is awesome!!!"" 😜😜 …"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Lovely dog-friendly patio. Great food. Solid staff. Highly recommend this little oasis.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"We hosted our wedding at Stable, and the team did an incredible job! The setting was magical, the staff were incredibly hospitable, and everyone commented on how excellent the food was, courtesy of the in-house catering team. 10/10, would recommend for future events."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Good things first: fast customer service, not too large of a menu and nice seating area + beautiful patio. The pistachio double baked croissant was good but was very dense and not very croissant like, more cake-y  Things I didn’t like: I got a latte and let’s just say I didn’t taste any espresso in there. Maybe I should have asked for a double."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Wanted a quick breakfast and found Stable Cafe. This was anything but that. The beautiful garden and patio, I meet new people and stayed til lunch talking."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I love to come here - there is a a really nice outdoor seating area, and also plenty of indoor seating. Thia cafe is great if you want to get some work done, and they also have free WiFi available. Staff is really friendly & espressos are great!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Nice cozy spot for breakfast/brunch. Quick service with lovely outdoor seating area.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Adorable patio and awesome food (+ great coffee & service)
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Friendly staff and a beautiful peaceful patio. I had a delicious Lox bagel which was one of the best I've had. This Cafe is a gem
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great outdoor seating, super busy and long line when I went, but very charming spot overall."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Very nice cafe to have breakfast/brunch here. I was checking envibe app for a cozy cafe to have breakfast in. And I really liked the backyard area there. I enjoyed my breakfast burrito and latte, and the friendly atmosphere.  And highly recommend this place."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Was here for a small event in the back! Very friendly staff, speakers readily available.  Very cozy space for coffee and food too."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great coffee and ambience. One of the best cafe’s in SF
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Lunches are basic but good. Pastries are maybe not that special. The courtyard area is really nice and green.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Nice outside sitting area.  Wanderfull food. Happy nice plants all around. Great coffee.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great place to sit and chat, get work done, and just enjoy the atmosphere. I didn't find any WiFi so if you are looking for a place where you can surf the web this isn't for you. Overall a fantastic find and would recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat and something to drink."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great food, friendly and competent staff, relaxing environment. Drip coffee was also $3 which is the most reasonably priced I've seen in a long time. GOOD coffee too!! Enjoyed our visit very much. Would return for sure."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"A spectacular space for a girls brunch. The outdoor area is spacious and breezy. Go to the greenhouse for a more insulated, warm table. I absolutely love this place and will go back. Great vibes."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in the city. Such a cute outdoor space with so many plants. They have a London fog for tea lovers and great breakfast sandwiches/wraps. Everything tastes healthy and delicious!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I like this place a lot. The coffee is really good, the attention also very nice and even the music they put is great! Went twice the same day, that's how good I think it is."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I always love coming here. It's been awhile. But coffee and food is still amazing and the side yard area is awesome to work by yourself or hang in big groups, bring kids and/or dogs. Do yourself a favor and check it out."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Consistently delicious 🤤 great atmosphere in the very charming courtyard
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Heading out to San Francisco, I had a long list of coffee shops I wanted to visit and this was on the top of the list. The food, coffee, and aesthetic were all good, but absolutely terrible service. I'm from the Midwest and so maybe I expect people to generally be courteous. I'm not sure what was going on, but I travel quite a bit and I've never encountered such disengaged, grumpy employees. Would not recommend based on this visit."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great patio space for working in the morning and early afternoon.  Breakfast menu is amazing the Pomba is the best thing on the menu. Lattes and coffee are also great. Lunch sandwiches are okay, but I often order breakfast for lunch instead.  Very pleasant staff"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Panini and a salad jeez Loooeeeyz was it purely delicious. Dudes got the DECORATIVE COFFEE SWIRLS ON LOCK🔒🔒🔒 …
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"This cafe's sitting area is its greatest feature. The lattes and pastries were good. My only gripe are the woman and man who worked that Saturday morning behind the counter. I have felt more welcomed at the DMV and my interaction with my ATM. They seemed as if they would rather be some place else, and that is fine, but do not show it to the customers. I agree with another reviewer's description of the service: grumpy and disengaged. Make the customer feel warm and welcomed especially when they are smiling and being friendly to you. It does not take a lot of effort nor costs money--and they may just want to come back."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Cool atmosphere and decent enough food. My issue with this place was the service. One employee in particular. He seemed very dissatisfied to be at work and gave an attitude with any question asked. When we had finished eating we went up to the counter to ask if we should put our plates and cups in an empty bin and his response was “well it’s not there to look pretty” and gave us a look like it was the most idiotic question anyone could ask. Very disappointing when we were trying to make the staff’s lives easier and also that I gave a 20% tip when we ordered. The service did not warrant the tip given and I would absolutely want a refund if given the opportunity. Would not recommend for this reason alone. There are better cafes in the city with better employees worth supporting.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great spot for a casual weekend brunch!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I really enjoy this place. They have one of the most lovely, garden-like outdoor areas!  They have great coffee and can substitute a non-dairy spread on the avocado toast. 😋"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"A magical spot with a magical patio on a very meh stretch of Folsom.  This place has the usual suspects - a decent spread of coffee shop breakfast items, pretty decent coffee. But the real star of the show is the patio. It’s just an idyllic space, a green oasis. It makes it a fantastic spot just to get away, to make a stop on a weekend morning, to catch up with a friend, etc.  The only downside is that the street, and especially the blocks west, can be a bit gritty."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"A coworker took me to this place in the mission district; I just got a hot chocolate at the time but the menu looked really good, the service was great and their back-alley seating area is beautiful."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Nice coffee place, good atmosphere and the chai is delicious, not crazy sweet like the commercial versions. The outdoor seating is a nice break from the city"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Fantastic coffee with pastries by local bakery Kahnfections. The food, service, and atmosphere are always the best and they even sell plants from a local company! No wifi, so you just have to find something else to do on the gorgeous back patio :)"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great cafe serving brunch with a gorgeous outdoor area. We ordered the London fog with a  egg muffin (with bacon) and the Luna, a bagel with two fried eggs, fried mozzarella, avocado, and cream cheese. It’s a great ambience, food is very fairly priced, and drinks are great. Highly recommend - just make sure you specify if you want a runny yolk on the egg muffin."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Probably my favorite cafe in the city. They have the absolute best London Fog, and a super cute loft-style layout. The outdoor garden brings me peace before heading into work."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Food is great. People are amazing. And the outside space is gorgeous! I love their cookies and custard tarts.  2022 update: the Korean Chicken Sandwich is amazing! Not only does it taste great but the colors are stunning. Same great spot. Keep on comin!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I loved the vibe at this place. They've a lot of open space and surprisingly no waiting time, people are constantly moving. It's a great place to catch up with friends and amazing food too. Their Pomba and bagel are great. The coffee is good too. No complaints about this place :)"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Top tier ambience, amazing baked goods, and delicious breakfast. I would have been extra impressed if my cold brew didn’t come from a can, but it was the perfect pairing with the Luna plate."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Amazing spot. We had avo toast and korean sandwich. Both were amazing.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Soooo good! Best vibes inside, cutest patio, incredible coffee, the people working there are awesome, and the food is just so good. Please bring Pombas back 🥲 …"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Awesome little cafe. Drink was on point, and the breakfast oatmeal and fruit was delicious. Very nice staff, cool place inside."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Such a nice outdoor seating are for brunch!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Such a cute little place for coffee or brunch! Love what they've done with the outdoor patio seating area with the succulents and trees. Great for dogs and cats alike! It was a beautiful Fall afternoon in November, so the weather was perfect for sitting outside. Many of the outdoor tables are communal, but that wasn't a big deal for us.  We came on a weekend and found that they only have the breakfast menu until 3pm (no lunch menu), which was cool. We ordered the Luna, Stable Eggs, Pomba, and Ham & Cheese croissant. Everything was delicious! Loved that each dish came with a bit of fresh fruit on the side. All of the dishes were super affordable at $9 or less. A single digit dish in SF is something I can't really complain about, and the quality was great for what you pay.  Love the concept. Keep doing what you're doin'!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"The staff and atmosphere here are amazing. You can really feel that the people make the place. Very good coffee, and modern yet comforting menu, lots of choice, fresh juice, beautiful walled patio area, enough space to work and eat, lots of light due to the big windows. Restrooms were very clean and tidy and the wait was minimal, even during morning rush hour. All in all a great place that puts a lot of effort in getting the details right!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Good spot to get a solid coffee and get some work done
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Really nice patio, and amazing breakfast egg sandwich - very very good (mixes very well the lemon aioli with the bacon and egg)."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"This place was soooo good! And their cappuccino was delicious. My group of friends and I sat in their outdoor seating area with our pups. Everyone was friendly, the staff was great, and the garden seating area was unique and hard to come by in SF. Make sure to check this place out! A heads up, the line to order food can get pretty long, so don't be in much of a hurry. ;) Worth the wait."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great ambiance! Cosy with good food! Awesome service tops it off.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Such a lovely Cafe with super warm and friendly staff.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Such a lovely cafe with a drop dead gorgeous outdoor seating area. Really reasonable prices for SF because they give very generous serving sizes. I was surprised at how big the mimosa was!  I'd definitely come back again to have brunch with friends or just grab a spot and do some work. The patio has a green urban oasis kind of feel that is rejuvenating.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great breakfast and coffee. Their house salsa is so good.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"My granddaughter and I were visiting the Biltmore Estates and had reservations for lunch at The Stable Cafe. It was not crowded and we were promptly seated. The atmosphere was warm and cheery as it was decorated for the Christmas holidays. My granddaughter ordered the classic cheeseburger which she enjoyed; but, it was a little undercooked than how she ordered it. I had the autumn vegetable succotash which was absolutely delicious! I'm trying to find the recipe because I would love to make it for my family. The dish was creatively decorated with an artichoke in the shape of a rose that laid across the bed of vegetables. It was so tender that I ate the whole thing. The dish had a nice lightly roasted flavor and a variety of autum/winter vegetables. I would definitely get this again the next time I visit."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Food: Excellent breakfast pastries and coffee.  Decor: I love the patio and industrial feel. Lila B. Design provides the potted plants and artful succulent arrangements.  Service: The servers were prompt and outgoing. They were pretty chatty in the right way -- not so much that they held up the line.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Waited 25 minutes for my order with my number out, watched people behind me in line receive food immediately, finish and leave - went to check with the kitchen, they were extremely skeptical that it could have been lost. They made it again in 90 seconds. No apologies or kind words. I even tipped 20% (as I paid, no chance to change it).  Don’t be polite and wait like I did. If food isn’t out in 5 minutes, they probably lost it.  The bagel wasn’t even toasted when I got it. Won’t come here again."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"The coffee is great, the food is tasty (especially the breakfast), and there are a number of different seating areas: outdoors on the sidewalk or the patio, the quieter upstairs, or in the more active first floor.  Plugs are limited here, so you may not be able to work for many many hours depending on if you can get a seat near an outlet, but you can certainly read or write here. It's a great atmosphere"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,One of my favorite places in the city. Lovely ambience and decent coffee. The server was extremely kind and courteous. I got the Lox Bagel and almond latte. Would definitely visit again!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Their coffee is only decent tbh but I always come here because they have the BEST outdoor seating cafe setup in the whole Bay Area. No wifi
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,good atmosphere and good food but the coffee is only ok
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Tasty and affordable food and a great garden. However, espresso is average at best - not strong enough and bitter. Need better quality beans and grind them immediately before making a cup. Cold brew, on the other hand, is pretty decent."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Amazing service and atmosphere. Stumbled across it and ended up working from the outside area for 2 hrs!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great vibe and delicious food!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I went there to work on a project midday Wednesday, and the outdoor sitting area was a great place for that.  There were trees and lots of sitting. My sandwich, coffee, and cookie were pretty good and the stuff cheerful and friendly. Both inside and outside are furnished pleasantly, making the cafe a great place to sit down for coffee or snack, or hang out a bit, or work for a while"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"wonderful place to sit and chat with friends. also a good spot to work. SF local crowd.  tons of outside seating. tasty food.  -1 star because my cappuccino was beaytiful but tasted just okay.  with so much good coffee to be found in SF these days, it seems the Stable could have coffee which is as amazing as the rest of the experience."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,The quality of this food is subpar at best. The avocado toast bread was low quality and could've used some lime or salt. All their food feels like a teenager could make it and didn't feel like attention to detail was put into making the food. The outside seating was very nice though and redeeming quality of the place.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Cute vibes, huge outdoor space"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Met a friend here for late lunch on a Saturday afternoon and had a great time. There's ample seating, the atmosphere was laid-back, the food came quickly, and it was simple and delicious - not overly seasoned or salty. There is a garden where you can sit and have a coffee and read, or grab a bite. It's a great place to spend a sunny afternoon. There's also a small, cozy upstairs area inside the building that's a bit quieter. I'll definitely be coming back over multiple weekends to do some reading!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Stable Cafe is my go-to spot. 5 stars for their space! The sandwiches are good too, especially considering how affordable they are. The coffee is something they could improve on. It's not bad, but it could be better. Also, they don't have wifi anymore, which makes sense considering COVID but I hope they bring it back after the situation improves."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great coffee and tasty treats. Fun relaxing atmosphere. Beautiful garden space for events! Lots of space and privacy in a very romantic setting.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Take a blanket and settle for a great coffee (or tea) in their patio. Food is good and very fairly priced, great atmosphere. They have limited in-door seating but the terrace offers plenty of space but can get chilly."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Amazing cafe to visit in the mission. Have an outdoor patio oasis that is the perfect place to enjoy their delicious coffee. Their breakfast plates are also really tasty. Have fast wifi with lots of indoor and outdoor seating.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Wonderful outdoor space with lots of plants and trees, which really purify the air. Lovely CA farmhouse vibe. Never eaten here but food looks good. Nice staff. Some long communal tables. One ding- wifi is very spotty outdoors so I end up needing to tether but ATT coverage is bad too. Don't expect to be able to make calls or get online outdoors here. Definitely recommend otherwise."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Nice quaint eating place with some indoor but mostly outdoor seating areas. The food menu consists of sandwiches and salads which definitely make it for a great place to grab a quick bite but also stay and chat. The outdoor areas are partially covered so you can eat outside anytime.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"This is an amazing place for a brunch. Go see the inside garden, that place is an earthly paradise. And the interior ""decor"" is unmatchable - you won't find many other stables-turned-coffeeshops.  Dishes are creative for reasonable prices - I got the signature stable eggs (see the photo).  The staff is affable and efficient.  Patrons are the hipster crowd, it will not get more hipster than this. You can get your avocado toast here as well. Fun to people watch. Also, apparently, this a popular place for first dates.  For working, the second floor would be great if there were power outlets (zero!). Wifi is solid. Also, it can get a bit noisy because you are just above the counter."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"A beautiful cozy coffee shop in the middle of a rugged neighborhood. If you're looking for a sigh of comfort, you'll find it here. The coffee is delicious, the food is scrumptious, the staff is friendly and welcoming to all, and the space will make you want to sit without your electronics and relish in the beauty that is life."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Breath of fresh air! Great patio and event space. Like a hidden gem with bricks laid down during the gold rush.  Vibrant staff. Friendly. And very dog friendly.  Food looks great. Being a low carb person I appreciated and enjoyed the frittata with the killer sauce.  Certainly go back and will make it a hang out spot with friends. Nice to see gay men.... they are hard to find these days.  Must visit place.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"How can i put this place into words? Quiant, lovely, peaceful,  affordable,  healthy,  neighborhood joint,  friendly,  accomodating to different ways of eating,  refreshing,  excellent at executing food and drink,  i think you get the picture.  Lovely little restaurant and loft,  but the real gem is the patio and the food itself.  Simple dishes,  non pretentious, just the right amount of food on the plate to satisfy, and prepared to accentuate the flavors of the ingredients,  not to mask them in oil.  I only wish i lived in the city so i could come here more often."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Fantastic spot to catch up with an old friend or even catch up on some work. One of the mission's hidden treasures. I absolutely love the outdoor space and frequent the attached plant shop. The menu features several healthy and organic picks, and also has it's fair share of indulgent items as well."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"One of my favorite cafes to go to in the city. I love the balance between the outdoors and indoors aura of the place. This place has it all from staff/service, coffee/drinks, food, environment, and people. This place is also really convient to get to in the Mission."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Walked in, waited in line and made order fast. Super cool staff. Sat down upstairs and there is a patio that is large with plants. All around great place. I saw some folks working there as well. Good location for meetings I feel."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"My favorite place to grab coffee in SF.   The architect (who's office is upstairs) - Malcom Davis - did an amazing job with the space; really cool exterior black facade, and exposed/industrial/wood-y interior.  Lots of seating for the size of the inside, plus a great outside area.  Everyone on the staff is friendly and efficient and individual.  Make sure you try the Mochi Muffin.  Love this place!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Good coffee, nice staff and a well done breakfast sandwich. I went there for a late Sunday brunch and sat upstairs in the loft, which made for good ppl watching. The cafe has exposed beams and art work on the walls. The outside patio is a must to visit on a hot weekend and a bottle of wine. This little cafe is for sure on the list for this summer."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Beautiful outdoor patio, simple menu of good food. Great place to meet a friend or a date!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I love this cafe! It's in a refurbished and repurposed old building that has a lot of charm. Great customer service from pleasant baristas, and the coffee and food is good quality. They serve salads, sandwiches, wraps, pastries, and even offer quick grab-and-go options. Great for lunch on a workday."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I love their sandwiches and salads. Good coffee too. And great staff. I usually get take out, but there are several nice seating areas and usually at least a little free space."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,My favourite coffee place in San Francisco. I always make a stop here.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Favorite cafe!! Engaging friendly staff, beautiful environment/atmosphere, dog friendly. One of those places where you feel like there's a community of good people and you are welcome. Get the espresso!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, affordable. Place to go for having breakfast among friends!!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Oh MY Gosh! The nitro cold brew and gluten free/vegan cookie bites are so amazing! The cold brew has a chocolatey flavor to it. Great atmosphere and service.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Food options are pretty good. The savory bread pudding is delicious (albeit a bit heavy). On weekend brunches they offer chilaquiles and huevos rancheros!  Its a nice place with heaps of outdoor seating. Its a great and cozy place to spend an afternoon.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"The space is cool and different then most but the coffee isn't so great and the service is pretty lame. The guy behind the counter told me he'd be right with me so at least I was acknowledged but then he began to walk around aimlessly without purpose and started finally pouring someone else's drinks while the guy actually making coffee just stood there. I don't mind if you're helping someone before me - go for it, but do it with vigor as to not create lines. Once I finally placed my order the ""barista"" began to chat it up with another patron who had walked in and after waiting 12 mins for my drink I began to think they had forgotten about me, but I was wrong. My drink came up and after all of that it tasted horrible. It tasted as if the shots had expired from the long wait after pulling and before placing in milk.  Once again the space is cool and they've actually expanded the pastry and food options but without the outside patio and fun modern decor this place would die off quickly and easily be a 1 star in my book."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Always a good option and always leave with a good vibe. Staff is friendly and thoughtful. Food is delicious. Patio and ambience is what it’s all about.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,This is a great outdoor cafe with lots of trees shared by Lila B the garden store.  I came here with a friend.  I ordered a quinoa salad and she got the prosciutto and brie panini I believe.  Nice healthy lunch.  It's a little oasis that makes you feel a bit distanced from the traffic and busy Folsom street outside.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Serene spot with great food and drinks. I love their commitment to low-waste
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Food was pretty good- slightly overpriced for a panini I could've made myself for less. The outdoor eating area is nice... most people were on their laptops working. Iced Chai tea was delicious... but next time I will ask for less ice for more of the actual drink!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"In a really cool building and good is delicious.  Very friendly staff and great indoor and outdoor seating area. Great place to just grab coffee in the morning, people watch, take your dog to chill or just do some work."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Pet friendly, great food, huge outdoor area"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Best coffee in the hood. Make sure to check out their daily specials too - always something new and tasty to try. If you need a quiet place to work, go upstairs into their loft. And if it's a beautiful day, make sure to take advantage of their adjoined outside patio."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Coffee shop and event space in a beautifully redone Horse Stable. The staff is amazing and the outdoor seating area would make any Gardenista blush! The food is great as well as the coffee.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Really good!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,BEST CAFE IN SAN FRANCISCO!!! Hands down!!! Can’t beat the outdoor space vibe!! 6 stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Beautiful plant-filled courtyard, so great to visit on a warm day. I had the quinoa salad which was delicious, fresh and deceptively filling. Staff are super friendly. Try the agua fresca too - it's yum. Breakfast finishes at 11am on weekdays."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Aweosme Cappachio’s, food, and A+ outdoor vibes"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Delicious food, wonderful coffee, and amazing environment. It was the first place we visited after a long flight and it was dog-friendly. The service and atmosphere were great!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Gorgeous space and garden. Delicious coffee. A little pretentious, but I think it's on purpose. Avocado toast was just slices of somewhat raw avo on a.thin wheat toast...stable eggs were bomb!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Was there last May for a wedding. The food was fresh and delicious. The staff are friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is chic laid back. We had a great time there.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"One of my favorite brunch spots in SF. It's a 'self serve' restaurant, the food is pretty good, and it has the most beautiful patio.  Great place to enjoy the sun and relax."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Outdoor seating is nice. They don’t have wifi. Coffee was tasty.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Beautiful place. Good coffee
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"As long as you go in with a charged laptop, this place will surpass your standards! AKA NO OUTLETS! Great coffee and food especially the cookies! The vibe is wonderful and the setting really is an old barn."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Nice for brunch. Good set of options and inviting outdoor terrace.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"A great place for tea, coffee, and a quick bite. There is some indoor seating and a large space adjacent that is a succulent garden/business. The coffee and food is pretty good, and the prices are fair."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,One of my favorite cafes in SF!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"I just watched the guy behind the counter (tall skinny man wearing long leather earrings) yell at a customer for no clear reason, then do it again at another customer a few minutes later, seemingly for asking twice for his coffee.  The coffee is good, but I'll never come back to a place like this."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Basically the perfect spot - tons of seating inside, outside, and on a loft. No wifi kinda vibe. The only downside is that it's open air, meaning that on a cold day it's drafty"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"One of my favorite coffee shops in SF, especially if I need to have a coffee meeting or work to do. There is plenty of room available in the outdoor seating, the coffee is amazing, and the baristas are the best!"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,A wonderful coffee shop. The food is noticeably made with fresh ingredients and the outdoor patio feels cozy and peaceful despite how close it is to mission. 5 stars!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,What a perfect venue for my wedding! Minah was an absolute delight to deal with over the course of the year of planning and her staff really made my day easy and pleasurable! Can't say enough good things!
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great coffee and tasty food in a wonderful environment. Their outdoor space is especially great.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Stable Cafe has one of SF's most beautiful backyards. You also find a succulent store in the backyard (Lila B Design), which I think started out as only temporary but seems to have stayed (luckily). Among many other delicious things they serve delicious agua fresca."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great outside garden to sit in. Wifi is fast but no plugs around. Good prices on food, all of which I've found to be tasty. Staff is super nice and friendly -- lots of regulars."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great food and coffee. Lovely patio seating surrounded by plum trees. Stable Cafe is a delightful oasis of calm in the middle of the city.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"This place is amazing, inside and out. Great food, great coffee, nice staff, and the damn coolest patio. I would eat here and stay to read every day."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Great space..had a mixed green salad with chicken and it was really tasty. Nice outdoor area...wireless is spotty though.. and coffee was not that great... perhaps the Batista was having an off day
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Whether you go for coffee, breakfast or lunch on the patio, Stable cafe is a class act. You can actually converse here. There's sometimes a small line, but it will not tax our patience. There is ample bike parking and even the possibility of car parking nearby. It's on the route of the 12 Folsom if you are coming from Chinatown or the Financial District."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,The London fog is the best here. Tiny little cafe with a beautiful outdoor seating area. The staff is so friendly. Definitely have the London fog.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Love the outside area to enjoy a meal! I also liked the panini or sandwich with mixed greens lunch plate. Good tea / coffee / juice selections as well.

Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Quite busy for a late lunch - all the outside tables were taken and it was after 2pm.  Tasty sandwiches and side salads.  Nice vibe, interesting local crowd."

Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Beautiful space and outdoor seating. And, of course, great coffee. No vegan options that I saw, but they'll adjust existing menu items for you"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Great coffee, great gluten free frittata. Would definitely return."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"The reason there is always a line is not because the food is great, it’s because they are  ridiculously slow. I haven’t ever seen such an inefficient ordering process in a long time. Food is very average. Location is great."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"The food and coffee was delicious, but what truly makes this place wonderful is their gorgeous patio."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Beautiful back patio in which you can sit and enjoy the sun and wonderful weather. Decent coffee and good customer service makes this a great place to stop by and enjoy a coffee at.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,A nice brunch spot with outdoor garden seating and a casual vibe.  Coffee and food were good and food came to us quickly.  You order at the counter and then the bring it to you.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Went in to grab a coffee and some lunch, encountered a coffee barista thats worse than a methhead having a bad day. While waiting in line to place an order, the employee became frustrated and started shouting that his previous customer hadn't picked up his coffee. He complained it was getting cold.  Unfortunately, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time as he thought it was mine, though I hadn't placed my order. I motioned to him that it wasn't mine and I explained I hadn't placed an order yet.  While talking with the polite cashier, He hovered inches from my face listening to the order. I ordered a cappuccino, and he slammed to cold latte in-front of me and said ""THERE YOU GO!!"". I casually told the cashier I was looking for a cappuccino and a sandwich to go, and he dumped it out.  In his frustration he made a cappuccino in a regular cup ""not to go"". I asked him for it ""to go"". He told me I could drink my coffee and when I wanted it ""to go"", I could come back, get in line, wait, and get the remainder poured into a to-go cup. I explained that wasn't what I'd like to do, I'd really just like my correct order ""to-go"".  He made faces at me, and I asked for his manager.  He refused to get his manager.  Upon leaving I asked again with a different employee for the manager, as I left he was shouting across the restaurant ""WHAT YOU WONT EVEN TALK TO ME!?!?!?"" and followed me down the street to complain at me.  This guy was on some serious drugs, the manage (Francisco) offered me a free lunch on him for the trouble.  I don't recommend going here if you're looking for a chill atmosphere, this barista was hostile."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Delicious food and uniquely pleasant atmosphere! A must visit.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,Sweet place. Tasty food. Good coffee.
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Avocado with chili flakes on plain, dry toast. Needs some mayo & tomato, too dry. ok. Peanut butter and Nutella sandwich comes with a salad. Hmm, ok. Toilet was broken & didn't flush and had been used repeatedly. Hmm not ok."
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Cute, lots of plants"
Stable Cafe,2128 Folsom St,"Stable cafe is a true gem in SF, it's inconspicuously hidden in plain view on Folsom street and 18th, but you'll know when you are here how amazing of a place it is."
