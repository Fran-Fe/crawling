Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"This location is a coffee shop and also a gallery. Their coffee is Fourbarrel, and I can buy donuts there too. Sometimes their gallery's paintings are cool. However, when I go there, always many people are in line. It might be only me though. Btw, their space is cool. Staffs are kind. I like this space."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Beautiful art gallery. Verve coffee. Great ambience. Good latte art, but milk was _slightly_ burnt."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Location is great, interior is unique because of the art gallery setting.  My coffee was also tasty."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,Good place to work or to talk. Modern and clean. Coffee is OK and I feel a little expensive than it's quality.
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Big space, friendly, good for business meetings or hanging out. The mocha is really good. Plus hidden room for private events or live music."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Art gallery + coffee shop. Usually filled with people in the midst of mini meetings, or working on their laptop. The place is often closed for events though."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"No pour-over, but the drip is great! Also great is the art on display. They also have dropped Four Barrel for Verve, as their roaster."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Really cool place, with good art work. Bar drinks (alcoholic) and coffee and tea too- reasonable prices. Went here to study and drink coffee, but there is no seating with tables that are easy to work from- it is best not to go here to study but to enjoy the surroundings and the company! Go to catch up with friends or for the art experience or taste of good coffee! (Also seemed to be a lot of business meetings going on)"
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,This place is super cute! It's an art gallery + coffee shop + a bar at night. It is so close to my office and the perfect spot to have meetings or grab a coffee. This review is focused solely on the coffee shop AKA Red Door. Loved the ambiance! My coffee was okay but they burnt the milk a little bit... No worries though! I'll still be back :)
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Delicious coffee, great ambiance, and Dynamo Donuts! Stopped here to chill as recommended by a friend. It's a very artsy cafe, part gallery, part coffee shop. The walls were adorn with screens and framed photos of sensual women. Seating was very loose and scattered, which kept the ambiance easy going and spacious."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,Located in an art space and serving verve coffee.
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"As a lover of coffee shops, I'm always happy to see ample seating - which seemed to be present when I came by.  I'm not a coffee snob (uhhh yet...I think - I'm working on it) so I grabbed a maple cinnamon latte - which was lovely.  I am a fan of the industrial decor in the shop.  Looking forward to coming up with a reason to go back"
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Great alternative coffee stop in the am. Their cold brew and Americano are solid, the donuts they serve are excellent. Service is sometimes a bit slow but there is rarely a line so it's not too much of an issue."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Four stars for the coffee, service, and fresh flowers on the tables!  The setting Is pretty smart albeit not what I expected.  It's a co-located bar/gallery/coffee mashup...and the door you see on maps isn't the one you go through in the morning.  No biggie...only gripe is more chairs with backs on them for we oldsters."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Coffee shop in an art gallery! They serve four barrel coffee (my local favorite), make beautiful latte art, and serve fresh made toast using bread from The Mill! They just started doing avocado toast too which is amazing. They don't serve the toast on Monday until the late afternoon though. The rest of the week it's available early. ;)"
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Excellent atmosphere and a fantastic place to work remotely. ""Red Door"" is one of several establishments in the area that serves primarily as a bar, but converts into a café during the day to cater to San Francisco's massive population of office workers. The place is spacious, offers free wifi, and features artwork from local artists, which changes monthly.  While their coffee selections aren't hipster enough to please a true aficionado, they do have kombucha on tap!"
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"I come here once a week, and always enjoy it. The atmosphere and artwork they rotate through is always fantastic. Good coffee and the everything croissant with cream cheese inside is the best thing ever!"
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,Chill place inside an art gallery with both coffee and a nice bar
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"This location sells Four Barrel coffee, an assortment of donuts, and in some days even has big, thick toast. It is situated in an art gallery and bar as a pop up style establishment. Search for their DropCam style webcam to see how long the line is before making the trip there. Stay for the seating and art."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"A great spot for business meetings, coffee catch ups and working remotely (free wifi). Lots of coffee choices, not much in the way of food. Big, airy gallery space with unique art pieces."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Had a great soy mocha: great flavor, not too sweet.  Space is nice and open.  There was a decent line at 9:30 on a weekday morning, but it moved quickly."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,The best of both worlds: art gallery and coffee.
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,I had a couple of hours to kills in FiDi before a client meeting so I decided to park myself at the Coffee Shop. I decided to get the cold brew ($4.50) and asked for single pump of vanilla flavor but was told that apart from simple syrup they don't have any flavor shots. The barista was friendly which is the case in most of the coffee shows in FiDi except Peets.  The cold brew had a clean non-acidic taste as expected but it lacked any real depth of flavor and felt monotonous. It did the job of keeping me busy for an hour or so and I was on my way as a happy customer. 3.5 stars rounded to 4 is how I'd rate this place.
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"I come here because of two things: ambiance and the Dynamo Donuts. They serve Four Barrel coffee and their mochas are okay, not as rich as Philz coffee, but I like supporting them versus Starbucks. So far, I've the powdered cake and spiced chocolate donuts. The texture is cakey, moist and substantial. And the flavors are will balanced. Since they serve out of 111 Minna gallery, you can enjoy the artwork and find plenty of seating. Not a bad place to work remotely. Most folks are in and out."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Another super hip coffee joint. Im all for new coffee shops i just wish they weren't all so similar in their approach to roasting. I find that the more hipster the place the worse the coffe is. I need a nice bold dark roast, the options here are way too acidic. They often will not roast anything more then medium. I had an Americano because the espresso is sometimes better but not the case. It is like drinking a cup of hot orange juice. I love coming to new cities and trying their coffee scene, but more often than not end up with my tried and true Starbucks. Love it or hate it you will most likely be able to find a coffee roast you can enjoy which is more than i can say about the new coffee meta."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Good standard cup of drip, nothing overly mist have or must go though, would improve by diversifying coffee specialty drip options.  Nice gallery and interior space."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,Great eclectic coffee shop / bar / art gallery. Seems like everyone here is meeting with venture capitalists or startups. Consistently a good espresso and their toast is bomb.
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Made me a very nice Flat White the way it's supposed to be made, not like Starbucks. Nice selection of savoury and sweet pastries. I had a almond and blackberry croissant which was nice."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Great place with lots of uncomfortable seating. Also has a couple of full bars, an ATM, and the 211 Minna Street Gallery - which is part of SFMOMA (museum of modern art)."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,Really love this place. It's awesome place to for friendly and business meetings. The coffee is a bit cranked with caffeine for my tastes.  If you're commuting by car the location on minna street is great for a luxe pickup
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Red Door is a fantastic space to hold idea-quenching conversations, enjoy rich coffee and pastries, and search the web on accompanying wifi. Thank you, friendly Red Door staff for wrapping the space in a bow of affection"
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Lots of space for a quick meeting, doing work, or just hanging out with a Gibraltar.  The baristas here know what they're doing and pull a solid espresso (with soda back... The way it should be)."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"For San Francisco, this place is very spacious. The coffee isn't anything special per se, but it makes for a great place to hang out with friends or get some work done."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Cool gallery space, very crowded on a weekday afternoon, good for casual meetings and only a few benches for laptop work. Could get pretty noisy."
Red Door Coffee,111 Minna St,"Great spot to hide and work in the middle of a hectic city. Decent coffee, plenty of outlets, free wifi, silent and ambient atmosphere. Try a donut."
