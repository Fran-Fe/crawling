Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This is real Szecguan food and it's spicy but not TOO spicy. The quality of the food is top notch. So delicious.  The Shanghai dumplings are among the best I ever had, served with the black vinegar and ginger they should come with. The smoked Tea Duck may be even tastier than the best Peking Duck. It's also served with pancakes , duck sauce and scallions like Peking Duck. Too many other delicious dishes to mention. The snow pea sprouts with garlic were actually water spinach which I like 10 times better than snow pea sprouts."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Loved it.  Make reservations for this very popular place to eat in Chinatown.   Food was authentic and tasted great.  Large portions.  Service was good too!
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"A popular Sichuan restaurant that serves hot spicy food. I got there just in time to get the last table available. It was completely full and a waiting line formed outside. The service was efficient, the food was terrific, and the prices were reasonable.  But the total bill ended up almost 1/3 higher after 16% tips were added to the bill automatically, plus 4% SF Employer Mandates and 8.625% sales tax. Well, it’s the norm now for almost every restaurant.  I ordered: 4*Bean Jello in Red Chili Sauce 川北涼粉: spicy and good.  5*Stir-Fried Chinese Cabbage w/ Chili Pepper 鐵板手撕包菜: crunchy and tasty, you can’t cook better cabbage than this. I was pleasantly surprised."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This one was a pleasant discovery. Good food, loved the flavours. There was a 15-20 mins wait for lunch on a Saturday afternoon however the wait was worth it. A perfect place for people who love spicy food. The dumplings are a must try here."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Ordered Tantan noodles, chicken with chilli explosion and fish fillet with chilli oil.  The spice level is not too high as we initially anticipated. Tan tan noddles was our favorite. For the other chicken dish, we found the quantity of chicken was very less for the cost(30$). The fish in the fillet had skin on top of it which was not to our liking."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Food was very authentic and fresh. Services were good. Clean enough as a Chinese restaurant in China town. We really enjoyed it and will be back next time. Non need to order a rice which is $3.50 a bowl but Save your space for delicious food.
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"The taste is good, but most reviews are overrated. The price is too high for what they serve. I ordered chicken with explosive chili pepper and boiled fish. As you can see from my picture, the main role of these two dishes are chili pepper, just very little chicken and fish. And these two costs nearly 65 dollars! Not need to mention how long you need to wait outside in freezing wind to sit and wait for another half an hour to get dishes on your table. The service is also average, but you need to pay mandatory 16% tips for party of 2 or 20% tips for party of 4."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Food was great. Loved the spice, flavors were awesome. The orange chicken was crispy but not greasy. Service was quick and staff were attentive. Worth the wait and very fairly priced."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"I recently visited Z&Y Restaurant after seeing some enticing Instagram videos, and while my experience was decent overall, I can only give it a three-star rating. The food was good, but I wasn't particularly impressed with my dish, and unfortunately, my appetizer was completely forgotten about.  I ordered an appetizer, but to my disappointment, I finished my entire entree before the dumplings I had requested even arrived. It seemed like they had simply forgotten the order, but when I inquired about it, they tried to explain that the dumplings take an exceptionally long time to cook. As someone with a background in the restaurant industry, I appreciate honesty, and I would have preferred if they had admitted their mistake instead of shifting the blame to the kitchen. However, it's possible that their dumplings genuinely require an extended cooking time, although it does seem quite lengthy 50 to be exact.  Moving on to my entree, it was satisfactory, but it didn't leave me feeling wowed. I received ten small pieces of fried chicken that were swimming in a bowl of dried chilis. While the dish had a decent flavor, it lacked that special something that would have made it truly outstanding.  Despite my underwhelming experience, I am willing to give Z&Y Restaurant another chance in the future. I couldn't help but notice that the food served to the patrons around me looked quite tasty, which leads me to believe that perhaps I just made an unlucky choice with my order. Hopefully, on my next visit, I'll be able to try something that truly impresses me."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,I’d give it four stars but the food was too good. The service was slow and I think that they forgot about me come time to pay. I had the house cold noodles and spicy dumplings. The spice was lip tingling deliciousness…
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"We went in Feb and was really impressed by the spicy fish dish. So we went again. Oh, that was disappointing. Still decent Szechuan food, but I wouldn't bring friends here again for sure. May drop in when we are around and won't wait for this in the future if there is a long wait."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Good Chinese restaurant, the chicken was super delicious! Even Barack Obama went there, so a warm recommendation. The atmosphere isn’t so nice but the food is yum."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,The food here is amazing. I would say it's about $30/plate. There isn't much seating. I would imagine there is usually a wait to get a seat. The service is unusual. The staff is very friendly. They bring dishes as they are ready. We ordered 3 dishes and they each came out at different times. It was good though!
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Wow! What a place. We had the explosive chicken and some vegetable egg rolls, it was amazing! Never tasted anything like it. Thank you!"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This is one of the “famous” Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, at least on paper. We went there with mixed experience. When the waitress put bowls and spoons on table, I spotted the greasy stains on a spoon in fact on two spoons. She said it’s normal and for sure they are sanitized. Surprised me, this Michelin award-wining restaurant even allows the greasy stains on their silverware. I don’t. My wife and I had to a wipe each of them. OK. Let’s talk about food. Pancake with beaf (牛肉卷饼) was pretty good. Steam pork dumplings was OK with juice inside, but nothing like 5-star. The most disappointing order was the house special Fresh fish filet in spicy sauce (水煮鱼). It is fully covered with dry chilly peppers. Spice was OK; however it missed the spirit of Sichuan cuisine –numbness (麻). Either the black peppers were not fresh nor the cooking was not right. The numbness from black pepper was not extracted in the dish. It made the fish meat smell fishy (腥味) but lack of deliciousness (鲜味). This house special dish was a shameful failure. Also the mandatory 16% tip charge was not right. The greasy stain spoons didn’t deserve such percentage"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Definitely pricey but awesome Chinese sichuan food. We got the beef rolls, green beans, and the beef slices in red sauce, would definitely recommend! There was a short wait (10min) on the weekend"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Tantan noodles ⭐⭐⭐ - it was a good flavor but didn't have the peanut taste I was looking for - it needed more protein or vegetables for me  ❤️ Explosive chicken ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - so juicy - perfectly spicy - so cute on its bed of peppers
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Great food. Could be a little crowded. Seems like they want you to leave fast because there are many people waiting. Staff is nice.
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Authentically delicious. Kung Pao Chicken is a staple of the menu along with the spicy steamed dumplings, but you really can’t go wrong with ANYTHING on this menu."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Obama went here lol  The food was pretty decent, but the serving size was a bit small"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This place was so good and worth the wait. I had never really been exposed to real Szechuan cooking and I was so pleased.  I will likely try and come here again next time I'm in San Francisco.  If you haven't had this style of cooking before,  the peppercorns have an effect on your tongue and create a pleasant sensation and often change or influence the way things taste. There are a lot of options in the area.  I would say you're always good asking a friend or local if that sounds too adventurous. I'm sure they have other things on the menu."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"The line was long on a Friday night but for two people we were seated after about 30 minutes at a shared table. Food was served quickly and we enjoyed everything we ordered. Highlights were the beef pancake and cabbage with garlic and chili which we would come back for. The duck was decent and pretty standard lo mein. Demerits go to a chaotic line outside without a lot of organization for putting your name on the list, and they forgot to put on of our items on the bill (which we didn’t realize) and came chasing us down the street to pay."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This restaurant has delicious food! Even though we had beef, chow mein and egg fried rice, my favorite was the tea cooked duck. It was SO juicy! I loved it all. THE TEA COOKED DUCK IS A MUST HAVE!!!!  I had their in house sake too and it was also good served warm! There service could use a little work, but they had issues with english and I don't blame them. The restaurant is in the middle of China Town. We came here 10+ years ago, and they were great then. They are great now. I look forward to coming again in the future."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Z&Y is next-level great. Go during off hours to snag a table without waiting too long. I went with two others around 2pm on a Saturday and only had to wait 15 mins. Service was quick and food was incredible. The best Szechuan in SF! Highly recommend.
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"I come back for the chicken with exploding spices every time I'm in the area. The food is to die for. They also accommodate large parties well. Recommend the chicken with exploding spices, sautéed green beans, spicy dumplings, and Peking duck"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"delicious szechuan food with an efficient ordering system! the wait may be long but you order prior to being seated so the food comes out quickly.  food is on the pricier side and the rice ($3/ small bowl) and tea ($12/pot) are a scam.  explosive chicken: sooo good, must try! portions are small and dish is expensive but still tasty  mapo tofu: would recommend! bigger portion at a reasonable cost."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"The decor is traditional, the service is great, the food is under expectation, the mandatory charging is beyond what it provides.  They are so customized for people cannot eat spicy food, aka most of non-Chinese customers, nothing bad about it since PF Chang is among most successful brand in the US."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,This was first time visiting this restaurant.  I’m a very disappointed with their service and food.  All the food has no flavor and and food were very salty.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all!!
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Award-winning? I assume the owner won the greedy award. This is my receipt. They charge 20% mandatory service fees and I don’t think this is the tip. We are party of 4 by the way. And the food is even worse. This place is the biggest scam in the Bay Area.
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"I sat for one hour and nobody checked us to order and pour water. I have never treated this like way in the US. All the people who came later than us were served. When i type this, i have sat for around 1 hour here. We asked three different servers to ask why not to take order. They just said on but still nobody came. The female owner did not even say sorry. Well. So interesting. I strongly suggest that they hire some better waiters and waitress."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Real 5 stars on Food.  Very good taste and fresh material.  Must call for reservation
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Can't say enough about this place.  Everything that we ordered was superb - from the soup to the dumplings, noodles, duck and even the complimentary dessert.  Indoor seating is limited but they have outdoor tables as well.  Service was superb."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Best restaurant in the city for authentic sichuan flavor. The head chef is also the owner and the wife runs the front of house. Quality control is definitely up there. Service can be a little better but, its understandable because of how busy they get!"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"Wow!  I ordered a pot of chrysanthemum tea and asked the server for a recommendation.  Without hesitation, he suggested the braised ox tail.  Such incredible subtle flavours..."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"The best restaurant, they deliver the taste of China. (Friends that ate with us told ua that it tasted the same as when they lived there.) The price are resonable & quality is definitly there. The staff is really kind and helped us with the order.  The table are made to share tour food with other which is really nice."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"I would definitely recommend this restaurant to try on.. the food is awesome  delicious. Services, taste, location, ambience.. 5*/5. Fast, clean, great atmosphere got indoor and outdoor seating arrangement.."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"If you like spicy food and are seeking the sensation known as paresthesia, then this is the place to go in the area. We waited 20 minutes for a table and service was fast, friendly, and attentive. We ordered the spicy octopus, but the flavor of the spices and ingredients just did not seem to fit together. The Mongolian Beef had a kick to it and was tender. The best dish by far was the Mapo Tofu. Dishes are good for 2-3 people and these are reflected in the price."
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This was my first time having authentic Chinese food and the experience was amazing! We had a large party so we were worried there woudnt be space, but we had a half hour wait, so we just a quick walk around town, came back, and our table was ready. The food was definitely worth the wait! It was absolutely delicious!! I would recommend the dumplings, spicy dumplings, egg rolls, oxtails, kungpao chicken, orange chicken, and noodles! Everything is al la carte so prices can add up quickly, but the quality of was definitely worth it!!"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,"This place is delicious! We ordered the Fried Rice with Black Truffle, Clam and Tofu Soup, Crispy Garlic Flavor Shrimp, Tea Smoked Duck, and Chicken with Explosive Pepper. Every dish was flavorful and satisfying. The portion to share with family of 4 big eaters were sufficient. We will definitely return for more!"
Z & Y Restaurant,655 Jackson St,Nice place to eat when in Chinatown. The overall food quality is good and the food is according the menu (hot means hot). The service was cordial although waiting time is a bit longer than expected. Feel free to go without worries. Enjoy!
