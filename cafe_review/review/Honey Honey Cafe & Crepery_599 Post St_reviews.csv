Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Honey Honey is an absolute gem of a breakfast restaurant! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and friendly service. The menu selection was extensive, offering a wide variety of delicious breakfast options to satisfy every craving.  I opted for their signature ""Honey-licious Pancakes,"" and they were simply divine! Fluffy, golden pancakes drizzled with honey and topped with fresh berries—every bite was a heavenly delight. The food presentation was on point, and the portions were generous.  The cozy and inviting atmosphere made my dining experience even more enjoyable. Whether you're looking for a leisurely morning brunch or a quick bite to start your day, Honey Honey has got you covered.  I can't wait to return and explore more of their delightful menu items. If you're in search of a top-notch breakfast spot with friendly staff and mouthwatering dishes, look no further than Honey Honey! Highly recommended!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"My partner visited this place half a decade ago and recommended we come here now that we were back in the city. Glad we did.  You have to get here early to secure a table without a wait. Came 7am on the dot with no issues with securing a table. The coffee was strong and the breakfast burrito was just perfect. One of the best ways to start the day. My partner also gave her crepes rave reviews. All in all, worth a stop."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Wish they cleaned their equipment better. Watched them not fully rinse out both the container to make hot milk for a latte and the blender for a smoothie 🤢  The cable car had enough salt that I'll be retaining water all day.  The sbl crepe was good but not as sweet as we wanted.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"When we first arrived we were concerned there wouldn’t be any seating available, however the bus boys worked diligently to clean finished tables and set numbers on them for future guests. While in line, the bus boys gave us table numbers so we knew we had a table! Food came out quick and was yummy. Very hard workers and great environment, thanks Honey Honey!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"One of the best Crepery in San Fran. They have this uniquely designed menu with a variety of desert crepes and savory crepes that's just captivating. You check out the menu, place your order, take your number, find a seat and they bring heaven to you. The food is fast, and yet amazingly delicious and they do give you a descent portion."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Food was outstanding.. I had Philly cheese-steak.. was ok . . I think it would be better if they pour a cheese sauce over the crepe, it would take away some the dryness.  My wife had Miami Heat crepe, was outstanding."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,This place is always busy but always worth the wait. I come here specifically for the fresh squeezed orange juice. I literally have never had a better orange juice and that’s not an exaggeration. I get a traditional breakfast every time I go as well but their whole menu is amazing. The line is usually out the door but they move people in and out without rushing you so the wait is never too long.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great breakfast place! Food came out quickly and was at a reasonable price. You have to go up the counter and order and then find a table to wait at with a card. The line can get long and it seemed like they were lacking workers. The place is somewhere in between a cafe and a restaurant if that makes sense, the tables were mostly meant for pairs. It wasn't that small but they could have definitely fit more tables in or have few more tables for groups of 4, especially when they can get really busy. All in all, a great place for breakfast cravings."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,We had the blintzes and a half moon bay crepe. Both were good. It's a little chaotic when you first walk in as everyone's lined up and orders at the counter and then they give you a number to go sit at a table and we worried we wouldn't get one but somehow we did by the time we got up to get our order taken. We did have to ask about our food when people around us were getting theirs and we did get it eventually without any explanation. Not sure what happened but it was hot so it had not been sitting. Warning the sauce they call spicy sauce is really spicy and I'm not shy to spice! :)
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Awesome breakfast and lunch place. Very busy, long line to get in but wvery well organized so line moves fast. Friendly staff, really good food, coffee, tea. Toatally worth the wait."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I recently visited Honey Honey Crepe and Cafe and was thoroughly impressed by my experience. The cafe has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere, with ample seating and a relaxed vibe that makes it the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a meal.  As the name suggests, the crepes are the star of the show here, and they did not disappoint. I ordered the savory spinach and feta crepe and it was absolutely delicious - the crepe itself was perfectly cooked, and the filling was flavorful and well-seasoned. My dining partner ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella and banana, and it was equally fantastic.  In addition to the crepes, the cafe also offers a variety of other breakfast and lunch options, as well as a good selection of coffee and tea. The service was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable for the quality of the food.  Overall, I would highly recommend Honey Honey Crepe and Cafe to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast or lunch spot in San Francisco. The crepes are definitely the highlight, but the cafe as a whole is a gem that's well worth a visit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Ate here on 7.16.2023. Did not have a good experience. I poured water from the free water dispenser that had cucumber slices and it tasted weird and was lukewarm. I asked for Pepsi and they handed me a very dirty can that was stained with what I think was soda. The food was ok, not bad, serviceable. We saw people in the kitchen without gloves.  Overall, just felt dirty being here."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery has a variety of breakfast options. It’s a very busy cafe and expect between 20-30 mins of waiting time over the weekends to get a spot. The service was okay and the food quality was good. Lastly the prices were very fair and reasonable.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,This place was delicious we got the SBK with hot chocolate and the 2-2-2 (we replaced pancakes with French toast) and got the chai tea. Waited about 10-15 mins for our food with about 5 other tables in front of us at opening. Would highly suggest getting there early to avoid crowds and wait time.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Self service cafe. A bit crammed since people have to queue to order and not much space between tables. My lemon crepe was quite disappointing. But at least they use proper coffee mug.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Sorry had to take pic on pic of meal. Love the organization of this busy place. Went for breakfast and it was great! No fuss especially on a Sunday morning with brunch lines.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,We were looking for a breakfast spot with a lot of options. Honey Honey Cafe had so many great options. Our breakfast came fast and was delicious. We will definitely be back.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We went for a Sunday brunch. Place was busy, and the line looked long. Thankfully we stuck it out. They are very efficient at moving things along despite how busy they are. Our meals were excellent. I had the Eden crepe (smoked salmon) which was divine. We had a mix of sweet and savory crepes among our party and everything was good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Honey Honey is a small, homey feeling cafe with lots of different breakfast and lunch choices from omelettes and crepes to burgers. The location and staff are kind and accommodating and food comes out really quickly. Would definitely recommend trying some of the items off of the specials menu and the specialty drinks are interesting as well. I do wish that the flavors or character of the place popped a little more in the dishes, but regardless the experience and food was pretty good. Would definitely visit again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Nice selection of dishes. Seating is rather close between tables. Line up and order at counter. They give you a number for your table. Eggs Benedict was ok. My wife liked the Crab Cakes Florentine. Hot chai was too sweet for me.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Delicious breakfast foods and multiple brunch options. Recommend crepes or one of their many eggs benedict dishes.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"No ambiance at all, crowded tables with a line that goes from the counter out the door. However, for the price, the food is very good. I ordered the Belgian waffle which came loaded with strawberries and bananas and a massive dollop of whipped cream. There was also a berry compote or glaze over them as well (I would order it without this if I ever came back, it was a bit strong). Served with syrup. Anyway, the waffle was great and the fruit was generous and fresh. The appeal is definitely the great tasting food at an affordable price!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"One of my favorite breakfast spots in the area, super tasty food and wonderful drink options. I got coffee and a smoothie today, but the italian sodas are also a favorite!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We ordered at counter, got a number for number, then picked a table. food was buses out to our table directly. We went at 8 in the morning. Service was fast. We love the large variety choices for breakfast. Food was good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Amazing cafe , friendly staff go early otherwise you may have to queue.  Good menu choice"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I’m sorry but I need to tell the truth… latte tastes like cigarettes ash water… the crepe is thick n some of the mixture is not fully cooked… fruits inside are okay, but hey, this restaurant is selling crepes but the crepes are not even well cooked… I feel sorry.  Cream is nice tho."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The croissant was perfect! Big portion! Delicious OJ!!! And the loved that they had different milk substitutes. I’ll be back for sure!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I had the North Beach Crepe and Latte. Excellent breakfast and service!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,A casual restaurant where you order your food at the counter and pick your own table where they will bring out your food to you. I ordered pancakes that came with a side of strawberries and sprinkled with powder sugar. Portions are huge. Pancakes were very thick  and yummy. I also ordered a side of bacon....very thick and yummy. The only thing I didn't like about here I had to ask for another container of syrup for my three fluffy pancakes.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great breakfast/brunch place! They have crêpes, pancakes, bagels, sandwiches, soups, and salads. Also very friendly attendance."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We came here for the majority of our breakfasts. Prices are slightly cheaper than most other cafes and portions are filling. Line can be long BUT it moves very quickly, and don’t worry about sitting to find a table, by the time you order something will open up.  If your not sure what to order, try the Eggs Benedict! Eggs Benedict were our favorite!  The potatoes were good, nothing out of the ordinary. The French toast was very sweet. Belgium waffle was loaded with bananas, strawberries and a ton of whipped cream. Husband loved their latte and house coffee. They have different syrups in the back to flavor your latte if you desire. Not sure if the cook just had an off day when we ordered the post street omelette but the veggies weren’t fully cooked and the omelette wasn’t sealed shut."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"A nice place to try different kinds of crepes. I tried the savory Mediterranean crepe. Would have liked to have had a sauce of some sort with the crepe. The baklava sweet crepe was very delicious. Both were quite large, enough to fill and share as well. Great service and atmosphere."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Original savory crepe is great and worth a try. Overall, It’s a nice place for breakfast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Delicious pecan and lemon pancakes! 🥞 This cafe has excellent options for veggies, including a wide range of egg dishes, crepes, bagels and traditional brekkies. We came here on a Sunday morning and the queue was long but did move quickly enough. Staff are super kind and helpful and the food is high quality and reasonably priced. Also in a lovely area of SF near Union Square so it's nice and central. Highly recommended!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"On a San Francisco trip, we found this great place for breakfast. We went three times over a week. First visit: Had a daily special Santa Fe Scrambled, it was good and spicy. Second and Third visits: Had Croissant Sandwich, enough to split the sandwich between us. I would recommend this place highly."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"It seems based on past reviews they’ve really cleaned up their act. The service was good (for counter service) and the staff was fast and efficient at cleaning upnot tables. The bathroom was clean! The wait wasn’t bad even though it was packed, it is VERY noisy, just a heads up. I think they need to pare down their menu, I got the #4 bagel and it just wasn’t good. certainly not worth the money. But other people’s plates looked really good, the crepes and egg dishes especially."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Short walk from Courtyard Union Square on Christmas morning. Worth the wait in line inside. We each had a cheese blintz and it was really delicious, creamy, sweet but not too sweet. Left us satisfied but not stuffed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Tasty tasty! Pancakes were hot and fluffy, the eggs benedict were packed with flavor and paired well with the potatoes. The hot chocolate was SO GOOD and they served it in a fancy glass mug 😆 I felt incredibly special. If you're looking for a nice brunch spot in the Tenderloin that's spacious and accessible to the everyday person, I highly recommend it!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This was a random Yelp find for us. Highly rated over there so we made the trek in right after arriving in the city. Did not disappoint. There was a bit of a wait (we were in line about 20 mins) but they seemed pretty organized on getting people in to order, getting them sat, and getting empty tables cleared. After ordering, it was another short wait (about 10 mins) for the food to arrive - but WELL worth it. We ordered individually but did share and EVERYTHING was delicious. We also didn't feel rushed to leave, and sat enjoying some coffee for an extra 20 mins after we finished to plan the day. Almost returned for breakfast the next day, it was that good. Highly recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This place is amazing, they serve quality food and have great collection of items. First, we tried their cappuccino, mimosa and coffee everything bagel. The cappuccino tasted good, mimosa was excellent and the toasted bagel with butter went so well with the cappuccino. Next, we ordered Acapulco and pesto crepe, both tasted extremely well with great flavors, the potatoes given along side were a bit crispy and tasted nice and fresh. If you are in the city, I recommend visiting this place. Last, their staff is extremely kind and friendly, with the music playing, the indoor environment is quite lively!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Salmon Benedict and Nutella Strawberry crêpe was delicious. Also enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This place has been one of my favorite breakfast and brunch restaurants for a while, the food is great. Everything on the menu is elite, can't go wrong with anything you pick. The staff is very nice and they go beyond! I must say that the Sunrise Burrito 🌯 is one of my favorites! Love this restaurant! 10+ 👍🏽👍🏽 …"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Reeeeally enjoyed the food here!! There can be a bit of a queue but it's worth it, especially in weekends :) The menu mainly includes sandwiches, crepes and waffles.. I honestly wanted to try everything! I ended up choosing a Pesto crepe which was delicious! The plate really fills you in and the prices are still humans, considering the cost of any restaurant in San Francisco! Highly recommended If you are in the area!! :)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,A nice place were have breakfast They have a wide selection both salad and sweet. We tried strawberry&banana crepes and pancakes.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Honey Honey is a fantastic breakfast/lunch option in downtown San Francisco. The offer pancakes, crepes, breakfast sandwiches, bagels and more. Everything is freshly made and delicious. They tend to be very busy and have a line out the door but it moves quickly. Check them out!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"nice food, the crepe are good the inside is not the best but it’s good for a breakfast / brunch !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Was pretty underwhelmed with this experience... Suggested restaurant did not deliver (4 stars yelp). You have to order your food after standing in line rather than being seated and having a waiter, and this was ultimately this restaurant's demise.  I had to go up to ask for specific things no less than four times because we did not have a designated waiter as they did not anticipate salt and pepper, jelly for toast, etc.  Also the food was very underwhelming... the omelet was eggs cooked separately, and then cold ham and tomatoes stuffed inside rather than cooked within the eggs.  Very similar to Waffle House,.. do not recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I feel pretty fortunate to visit places that turn out to be a 4 or 5. However, this was definitely a 3 star experience. Overall, the food was alright, but not the best.  I wouldn’t NOT get the breakfast crepe again. The crepe was more like a tortilla. It was a bit tough to cut into which should not be the case. Definitely was more like a thin flour tortilla. The ham and veggies in the breakfast crepe were hot but had no change in flavor or texture like you’d get if something was properly cooked for flavor.  The 2, 2 and 2: eggs, a meat and two pancakes was also just alright. The pancakes were good but one of the pancakes was comically small. Felt like a rip off.  Barely worth the 10 minute line and then 20 minute wait.  It was busy when I arrived. It’s a order then seat establishment. I didn’t mind waiting in line for 10 minutes to place my to-go order since I could have easily ordered online. The staff was nice but I was shoulder checked by an employee as he rushed by. No big deal for me, but if I was elderly or had trouble standing I would have been knocked over.  Overall, slightly better than a Denny’s and more expensive. More casual, less class and cheaper than the brunch places around here like Mymy and Lapisara Eatery.  When I came home, plated the food and then brought it to my girlfriend in bed she asked me if I went to a Denny’s… 🥲  Has a large open interior with outdoor seating.  Eating in would probably lead to a better experience."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Steer clear until this place gets itself together. A deep cleaning, menu abbreviation, and staff retraining would be steps in the right direction.  The good: portions were appropriate for the prices and the OJ was freshly squeezed.  The rest: burnt bacon (to their credit they replaced it asap; while appropriately cooked, it wasn’t great), sticky tables and walls flecked with old food, lackluster service, food that tasted like it fell right off the Sysco truck, and suspect hygiene practices.  Not sure how this place has such a good rating, because our experience was beyond disappointing. The sagging awning should have been a sign for us to turn back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,What a place! It’s so Homely with various options to try. I love that the menu is extensive and plenty of options. The cashier/ person at the register was so easy going and line moves quick. She suggested couple dishes for vegetarians and it was so worth it. They have good portions and the place in general is lively. I would say just stop by if you are hungry for delicious food in affordable price in San Francisco.  Some other observations - their restrooms were clean - the get the fresh orange juice in-front if your eyes and unlike other places where they give you boxed - mimosa hit the spot so better order it. Don’t second guess. - if you have time - do study their menu or just go with their recommendations - table layout is planned so that everyone can be distanced
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Food is great however the space is too small, the line to order crosses the whole restaurant between the tables. The order was ready within 3 minutes. A few mistakes with the order though. Overall the food is delicious but I don’t think I’m excited to come back. I haven’t had the chance to take pics because the waitress hurries everybody to leave the table free for the bunch of people waiting."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Good spot for breakfast or brunch. They have an extensive menu of different items you can order at reasonable prices. Service is fairly quick and the staff are friendly.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"A real find on vacation. The line moves along with the most efficient server I've ever seen. She takes orders, makes coffee drinks, and stays friendly and helpful. Our food was delicious. Enjoyed a savory crepe for breakfast and an omelet. We dined in and had our order quickly. Fun stop! Update: we liked it so much, we went back. Same awesome service. Same great food. Tried the blintz crepe which was awesome! Might squeeze in another trip before we head home!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I was disappointed in the food. Great presentation but lacking in flavor.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The crepes here are what they're known for and, I must say, there is certainly a reason why this place is so busy !  I had the Eden crepe (Smoked salmon). It was delicious.  We came back here the next day for breakfast aswell because it was so good !  I had the cable car omolette the 2nd time and it was also amazing."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"First time visiting Honey Honey Cafe and Crepery with my colleagues on Friday for lunch and it was a good experience. We heard good things about Honey Honey, one being that they are good for large groups (6 or more guests). First, let me start with the positive! I really like the outside aesthetic of the business. The wooden happy face carved into the pole that divides the entrance under the awning is very appealing. Once you walk inside, you notice several large colorful chalkboards that detail the extensive menu. Now, in fairness, it’s very hard for ANY restaurant to do “everything well.” In honesty, I enjoyed the music (playlist) more than I did the meal. Now to my critical feedback, the food I ordered was okay. I ordered a Bacon Blue Cheeseburger and French fries. They did a good job on the burger, but the French fries left A LOT to be deserved. You can tell that they were frozen from a large bag and thrown into the deep fry. They were bland and lacked seasoning. Now, im always willing to give any business a second chance, so I look forward to trying one of their breakfast options next visit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Not great for large groups.  Nice people, good food, food came out quick."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The food was good, but first I got the wrong one served. The location is ok."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Unbelievable breakfast. Had the salmon benedict. Cannot lose here. Short trip to SF, stayed nearby. Ate here both mornings."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Breakfast was a bit pricier than I normally would pay. Top reviews so wanted to try. Felt somewhat rushed when ordering, although no one else in line. Great selection of meals. Food was good, but since the weather was cold and front door wide open, it took away from the meal a bit. Halfway through, someone closed the door and it quickly got hot inside. Guess that is why the door was open."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,This place has amazing food. I got the salmon scramble and it had a lot of smoked salmon with the eggs. The breakfast potatoes were amazing. So flavorful. Would def recommend to others.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Nice place, gets quite busy in the morning. You have to order at the counter and the food gets served to you. Nice staff. I love American pancakes, but they were a bit tasteless without the syrup. Luckily whip cream was also available. The fruit was also really fresh."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Very busy and a big lineup and yet they got us all in fast, quickly fed. Food was a great, service was great, the only downside to it being busy is the noise and pressure to finish eating!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Really nice place to eat breakfast. A good place for familys. The prices is fair, but there is a almos 4$ credit card fee which is in my opinion to much. The food was great and the service good. There was a 15 minute line, but when we ordered the food arrived quickly. I will recommend the place"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Variety of items on the menu for breakfast. Of you are by union square you should definitely go check this out. Lines are long but the staff are very efficient at guiding and taking orders. My son had the crepes and I had the post omelette.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Delicious banana Nutella crepes. This place was extremely busy so you know it’s really good food.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We had a long wait as the line was out the door, but the manager was making sure there was a table set aside for each group, so we had a place to sit after we ordered. The food came quickly, was delicious, and reasonably priced for SF. Great customer service and a huge menu."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Crepes were delicious, the crab cake crepe was one where you did not have to look for the crab cake. There was a mistake made when picking up my order but the service recovery was fast and top notch. Going there for more tomorrow morning."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We visit every time we come to San Francisco.   Love the vibe,  the food... everything is wonderful"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Good fast service! Like a crepevine! Had a post street omelette
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We went Here to experience a unheathly breakfast and we were Not disappointed. The Menu offers many sugary and savory choices (Crepes, eges, Pancakes, Sandwiches, ...) Portions were big but so were the price tags (~10-16$ per Crepes). The Restaurant is more of a one time experience, if you Happen to be in the neighbourhood. 2 Tips: - During our stay, two Independent customers send Back the french Toast ... - make Sure to come by before 9:30am or bei prepared for Long waiting Lines."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great spot! A bit busy- food comes in generous portions and delicious. Dulce de leche crepe was amazing! The north beach crepe had lots of chicken. Family friendly too, the kids liked seeing the fresh orange juice machine."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"In town for a conference staying at the Hilton and found this gem day one. My co-workers and I ate here EVERY MORNING. Crepes, pancakes, burritos are all large and fresh. Thick cut bacon, well crisped potatoes, and a very friendly staff make this a complete package for SF breakfast. Even during a rush, the front counter staff was cool, calm, and fast. Food came out hot and we left ready for the day."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The food was great! However if it gets busy it's not comfortable to sit in the place because they have customers wait to order between the tables in the morning. And coffee was really chalky not the most amazing!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Incredible breakfast and brunch joint. They also do lunch. Our table had the salmon eggs with potatoes and toast, as well as the crab cake Florentine. Both were so good that we came back a second time during our stay in San Francisco. It’s a busy place. Crowds come in waves. The food is well worth the wait."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Amazing food, loved the fresh squeezed orange juice! Lemon crepes and breakfast crepes were delicious as well. Helpful and friendly staff. Music was a little loud but overall experience was fabulous ."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Nice spot for breakfast. Lots of different things to try!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The food was really good ! Tasty and really fresh. We gave to this restaurant 4/5 because this restaurant little bit expensive. Our table was small and were full of noises from the kitchen. One more thing that disappointed is that: we ordered ""Greek salad"" and we got only lettuce with three pieces of cucumbers and little bit of other pieces of vegetables . The restroom was not clean. The bottom line, this is good breakfast and an expensive meal."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I really wanted to love this place, especially after waiting 30+ minutes in line to get a table, but it was really just ""okay"".  We got the chorizo plate and the strawberry and nutella crepes - the crepes were good but nothing spectacular. The chorizo plate and potatoes were delicious! The orange juice was freshly squeezed which I appreciated (although my boyfriend thought it was a bit sour haha).  Overall, it was an okay experience. Would I wait in a line again to get into this restaurant? Probably not...but it was a good experience overall."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Excellent food, wait staff were all friendly and expedient!  Atmosphere got 3 stars because for breakfast time, it was BUSY.  Nothing against the restaurant, just not a quiet breakfast like we were looking for."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The cappuccino was humongous, simply too much. And the milk foam was too fluffy and would float on (as opposed to mix with) the mediocre and weak coffee.  Also my salmon Benedict left much to be desired, tasting  generally bland and with the poached eggs being almost hard boiled.  On the positive side, the orange juice was freshly made and enjoyable.  Overall, I personally think the food is not worth the wait and it's unlikely I will be going back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Place was obviously popular. Line was out the door for brunch. Waited about 30 minutes to order. Staff were friendly, helpful, and worked quickly to get people served. Food was good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Absolutely amazing breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito, one of the best I’ve ever had. Chorizo and egg were seasoned excellently and the cheese was (for the most part) pleasantly melted. Beans weren’t dry and the salsa brought a great freshness to the dish. Alongside it, I had the orange juice. Trust me ; for a second just close your eyes about the price. It is the best orange juice I’ve personally had. Not even compared to store bought, but even to other freshly pressed orange juices, it was 10/10. Also tried the pancakes, nothing crazy but very fluffy, still very nice. Had a taste of the crab cakes, personally not a fan of seafood in general, but they were right on the money. Overall, great experience. Definitely recommend if you’re in the area !"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Had a delicious breakfast crêpe with fried potatoes. It was a very good combination. There are crispy bits of bacon with the potatoes. Yummy hot cider as well. Especially enjoyed the selection of hot sauce. Service is fast and friendly, prices are reasonable. #localguides"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great breakfast. Crepes are fantastic and the omelettes were just as good! The honey cake. Ha... What can I say there? The honey cake was one of the best I've ever had. Good mochas, good coffee, good service. I can definitely recommend Honey Honey. You won't be disappointed!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Chorizo omelette was very good. Breakfast burrito was decent. Large portions, good food and friendly and efficient staff. The queue is usually quite long (out to the door), but moves quite quick. I was there twice and both times spent around 15 minutes in line when it started at the entrance. They will get you a table when you order food."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"long queue but great food. value for money. we ordered the two & two, New Orleans crepe and Crabcake Florentine. they all taste good. Would definitely come back again!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,This place is terrific! Nutella and banana crepe was to die for! And the tofu scramble for the vegetarian in the group certainly did not disappoint! Flavors were fresh and delicious! Can't wait to go back and try more menu items!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Here in San Francisco with my dad on vacation and we went here for breakfast. The strawberry banana pancakes with pecans added  are amazing! This place was so good!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We recently spent a week in SF, and ended up eating here most mornings!  Pretty much everything here is great, we usually had a savoury plate & a shared dessert plate (the waffles!!!!!), ensuring we had plenty of calories for a long day of tourist-ing.  As a pro-tip, go straight to the counter and order, then you'll be given a table number, THEN you can go and sit at your table. It confuses quite a few newcomers!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Sunday, 9:30am - loong line, but according to the majority, its so worth it! It took us 1h30min to get a table to eat and... disappointment 😞 Definitely not worth the wait: the food was ok, just ok. Nothing really wrong with it, but nothing yummy or tasty either: both the North Beach crepe and eggs Florentine had a plain taste. Would not really go back,unless maybe to try their desserts."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,3 fluffy pancakes with fresh banana and strawberries was good. We had a side of whipped cream with it that really sealed the deal on them. The ham and cheddar breakfast crepe was excellent.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great little diner/cafe.  Indoor seating is now allowed.  They have a very expansive menu that includes sandwiches, crepes, and a variety of breakfast options.  I had the Mediterranean crepe and my husband had the breakfast crepe.  My crepe was filled w/feta cheese, avocado, artichokes, tomato, and onion - delicious.  It also included a super fresh salad. Everyone was friendly.  We enjoyed our brunch here and would return."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This was a very popular spot, but the line moved quickly. The menu was massive! We had the pesto crepe and the fresh crab cake eggs benedict. Both did not disappoint. Friendly staff and free flavoured water. The portion sizes were very generous."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Nice little gem. Great coffee, food and staff. Enough food to set you up before exploring San Francisco"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The best and most delicious breakfast cafe. There is so much choice that it is difficult to decide. Everything is delicious. It's always busy and there's a lot of people waiting, but the staff is well organized and it goes fast. We have been here several times and can recommend it."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Good options for food and drinks. The metod is ordering from the cashier, she also makes the drinks. You take your drinks to the table on your own (there are glass and water tanks near the cashier if you want water). The waiters are only there to bring you the food and cleaning the table - and they are not very eager to do anything else. It can be a 15 min wait before ordering."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"First time here and my wife loved it. She loves coffee but she decided to have their vanilla latte (regular on their menu but you can add syrups). She also order their Blintz crepé and she also recommends it. It is on the sweet side but really good, the cottage cheese balances it. I had their potatoes and chorizo as sides. Their chorizo is really good, highly recommend having it. As my wife said after taking a bite, “Mexican descendant approved.”"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Delicious gourmet food that belies the casual atmosphere. Having visited multiple times, I've never had bad food."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"A good breakfast spot with good food but it was not anything ""special"". Worth having good breakfast but not a place I would cross town for. I had the breakfast burrito which was a good choice as the chorizo was tasty. Just the right amount of spice and the texture of the burrito with beans made it a great choice. Mine looked no we than some of the reviews I had seen so I was happy. Service was efficient and friendly, menu was fairly wide ranging. My wife has French toast and enjoyed it as well. Meals were filling."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"It’s just. So. good. Not even a breakfast person and this place is a must. -Fresh squeezed OJ is perfectly tart, refreshing, and sweet. -Breakfast crepe is cheesy with hearty filing and light & doughy crepe. I was frankly skeptical about a savory crepe. When I think crepe I think Nutella & fruit. Welp, I’ll never look at a crepe the same way again.  My mind was blown. Potatoes are perfectly cooked with a unique hint of miso. Unreal. -French toast on thick fresh bread. Must dip in the side of sweet dream."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Although the name of the restaurant is crepes, they actually have a huge menu including breakfast items like pancakes and sausages,  burgers and fries, soup and sandwiches,  and more. They serve both sweet and savory crepes. All their food is fabulous. Go in, order and pay at the counter, take the number given and fine a seat. The staff brings the food to the table. Note, this restaurant is in the theater district so there is very limited street parking. Best option is to park in a Pau garage."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great food, Great Service . We did go on rush hour but totally worth it. I’m so happy with the selections of food there was . We walked over there which took us about 15 min from where we were staying at Market St. The house coffee was amazing, our food came out 10-15 minutes after we sat down, people working there are super nice even though it was crowded and that’s what mattered !!!. Totally recommending this place, come and eat if you are in San Fran."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Probably one of the best Nutella Crepes I’ve ever had! Fresh squeezed orange juice that’s a must and good food to company along with a black coffee first thing on a Sunday morning.  This place is located on a very busy cross street and the line can wrap around so expect at least an hour wait but well worth it.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"My hotel recommended this cafe. What a great, unique local hang. They had a large menu with multiple selections, from savory and dessert crepes to healthy egg white and salmon options. A full coffee menu also helps you wake up quickly! Will definitely be back."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Excellent quality food! The wait time was around 30 minutes to be seated, but well worth it considering the taste and freshness of the food. Highly recommend the Mediterranean crepe. Potatoes- well done - were fantastic and the artichoke filled crepe was delicious."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"If you like crepes and pan cakes, this place will be on your list of favorites. Crepes are tasty, the orange juice is freshly pressed, and the coffee is not a watery brew."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I really can recommend to go an eat there. The food is very delicious and the prices are very fair for what you get. Coffee is all you can drink.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Very good breakfast place or to grab a quick bite. There can be long lines, but they move people quickly. Our food was well prepared and tasty, definitely above your average breakfast joint. Somewhat bland interior."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I was also surprised by the extensive number of good reviews. This place is mediocre. Prices are around 10-15 an item. We ordered the salsa crepe and the blintzes. Both were kind of bland. Very odd. Needed lots of cholula to liven it up.  Potatoes were alright but had too much rosemary. The crepe also has some avocado that had already gone black. There’s better out there.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great service! Ordered their French toast, which was amazing! Also ordered there chorizo omlette which we didn't like, but they gladly changed it out for us no problem. Definitely would go back for brunch!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Nice menu. everything we had was done well. service was very good. nice atmosphere.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Very cute and fun breakfast spot with tons of options on the menu.  Very shareable.  Great service.  Bustling, lively place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Honey Honey is a fantastic restaurant and a perfect spot for brunch. I really enjoyed my Eggplant crepe. The staff are fast and kind. Give this place a try if you’re in the area
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Absolutely love this place, SBK is my favorite. However they have a spiced apple cider that’s simply delightful. You get your choice of ice cream or whipped cream, my chocolate fans went with the ice cream, probably necessary since they don’t hold back on the Nutella. They do serve other food as well. We just had a taste for a little something light and tasty."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Line was out the door, from when I got there...until I left. Lots of choices. I had the croissant sandwich. Pretty good."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Read this: Food: it is delicious, you need to come here. Vegetarian options too. We tried; -huevos rancheros 5 🌟 ( -Crossaint sandwich 5 🌟 -Omelette Acapulco 4 🌟 -Creepe pesto 5 🌟  Service: fast and long lines. Arrive early. 4 🌟  Clean: it's clean. 5 🌟"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Big menu, and pretty affordable. Order at the counter and they will serve you your food. I didn’t get an option for a side with my sandwich. I got a California sandwich and an almond cookie for around $12. Decent service and decent atmosphere. If I lived closer it would be a place to go when I couldn’t decide."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I didn't think breakfast could taste that good. Highly recommend huevos rancheros. Peanut butter crepe was also awesome! Lined moved fast, 45 min from out the door to food served."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Honestly an average brunch. Nothing too special..potatoes were a bit burnt but uts just your average diner style spot
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Fantastic food, extremely fast service. This place was pretty busy but our food came out very quickly. The crepes are great."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"After few years I came back to San Francisco and went to have a breakfast at Honey Honey. I was very pleased to come back as I was the first time I visited. It is delicious, this time I tried the Crab Benedict’s. The coffee is really good as well. Highly recommended and kudos to owners for maintaining the quality of the food."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Qucik and friendly service. Fries were amazing and the orange juice was great. Had the Nutella crepe which was good. Also recommend the torino crepe (savory).
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Food was excellent and the staff was very pleasant. Don't order the breakfast burrito unless you are super hungry or are heading somewhere with a fridge you can store leftovers in though!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This place is awesome.  Great food seasoned just right.  Had a cappuccino, nutella banana crepe, a savory breakfast crepe and a side of chicken sausage.  All were tops!  No hesitation to recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Excellent establishment, had the Florence with potatoes and it was delicious.  Add a pinch of salt to the potatoes and they were perfect.  No line during lunch was a nice change from other places nearby."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"It’s a good place to eat with the hosts being very kind. It gets packed quickly, has WiFi and had the football game on. The food was great and so was the coffee. The reason I gave them a 4 star is because the utensils they gave were dirty especially for an expensive meal. I paid $21 for Mocha latte and Huevos Ranchores. I think that’s a bit much especially because the coffee was mediocre. I asked for a change of utensils and received another set of dirty ones. Then got up and grabbed a set myself to finally get a clean set."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I really enjoyed the food here. Unfortunately so do a lot of other people so when I went it was quite a wait in line to order food. If you have the time to kill the food is worth the wait.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Such an awesome place. I got the SBK crepe and a vanilla Italian soda with a side of fries. The whipped cream was delightful and I love the addition of strawberry sauce on top. The fries were fresh and crispy. Service was quick, I love the self-seating option. Would definitely visit again the next time I am in SF."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Fast, yummy, well priced, friendly, good music. Food came out incredibly quick and everything tasted scrumptious. Definitely coming back!!!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Way overpriced. Paid $27 for a mediocre waffle and french toast. The food looks good and the environment is family friendly
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Amazing spot and worth the buck. Well organised for a very busy place with a line. But by the time you order you will have a table to dine for sure. Amazing food and great portion!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The sad thing is I crave the food here and I live hours away. The ambience is phenomenal with the Latin music in the background that I want to bring my mom here. The food is really good like the eggs with chorizo (chef kiss) and chocolate waffle and strawberry crepe. My only warning is for breakfast, don't order both the chocolate waffle and crepe cuz its a lot of sugar. The whipped cream was bomb tho and perfectly not too sweet."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Didn't expect much and anything exceptional but all of them were pretty good. We had an omelette, belgian waffle and strawberry banana crepe+ nutella."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This is a great joint. I've had many platters from here and never been dissaponted. The line can get long, easily. If there is one thing to suggest here, it's that they get more help up front. The person taking the orders seems to also make all the drinks and it slows down the line tremendously."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The breakfast crepe was very good, as well as the salsa crepe. The locals in San Francisco really like this place. Weekday mornings the lines are out the door. They offer, teas, coffee juices etc. The potatoes were too dry and overdone for me, but everything else was pretty good. The wait staff is a bit gruff, but with lines out the door, they are trying to move people. I will say that the restrooms we're immaculate."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Delicious food with great services. Breakfast Specials are must-try. Eggs Benedict with Potatoes was my favorite. Whip cream on Iced mocha is little weird but makes it unique taste.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We got the Belgian waffle, chorizo scramble and breakfast crepe and all three dishes were great! Long line (out the door) that took about 30 min but once we placed our order, it was ready in 10 min"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Good food and friendly staff but wasn't worth the wait. I waited in line for 35 minutes and waited for my food for 25 minutes after I ordered. Had the food been amazing I would have been ok with that because I wasn't in a hurry. But the food was no better than average. The crepe selection was very large though so I'm sure there were a few items on the menu that I probably would have been better than what I got.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This place is popular and was busy when I visted. They have a large menu with many options. I had the Crab Cake Florentine and a mimosa. It was delicious and worth the wait. I enjoyed the local feel of this place. I thought this place was pricey for brunch, but then again San Francisco is expensive."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!!! This place is absolutely amazing. Second time in SF, and second time eating at Honey Honey. From the staff being so efficient and quick and delicious food. Most amazing crepes in SF. Will definitely come back any chance I get!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"VERY BUSY, good food BUT you can find better if you have high standards or you care about the presentation of your food. They have lots of options and reasonable prices. Portions are fairly big. Their COFFEE is NOT GOOD/ they have fresh orange juice."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Extensive menu, reasonably priced, good coffee and not too long of a wait. We arrived at 8.30am and a line began to form after we had ordered."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Food was outstanding. It was a great experience.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"A wide variety of breakfast type food and sandwiches. I can recommend the crepes, they were just the right thickness. Coffee was nice and it was well priced. It's a popular place however, so there was a queue by 8.30 on a Sunday morning, so it's not somewhere to go if you're in a rush."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Set up is really cute, and there’s a wide variety of food. We went Saturday around 10:00, and it was crowded — so be prepared to wait or wake up earlier. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. Belgian Waffle was on point!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I'm an ""Eggs Benedict"" type of person, so I ordered the Benedict with ""Fresh Cab Cakes"". Honestly, I wasn't impressed. Something was off on the Poached Egg or the Sauce and the Crab cake was most definitely a lil off on the flavoring. The potatoes were tasty tho. Had coffee with my breakfast, sadly no one came to give us a refill. I'd go back if I'm too lazy to walk to Mama's (which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!)."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Decent crepes for a not too expensive, but also certainly not cheap price. Other times weren't as good but the crepes definitely hit the spot and did well for a quick breakfast with little queues near union square"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Delicious breakfast selections, with large selection, including many reasonably healthy options, quick friendly service and well worth the wait!!!  My goto breakfast choice when I'm in San Francisco, staying near Union Square. You won't be disappointed."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This place had incredible food! I ordered an omelet and it was huge and cooked perfectly. They serve the freshest orange juice that is literally squeezed from a machine on the counter and you can watch it work, which I thought was neat.  The other reviews were not kidding about getting here as early as possible, because the line goes out the door and around the corner if you don't. I got there around 8 a.m. and the line was already out to the front door. Totally worth the wait in my opinion though. I probably waited 15 -20 minutes in line, and another 15 minutes or so for the food to be brought out.  Some advice for when you visit: know what you want to order before you get to the counter! They are so busy, there is no time to waste once you've made it to the front of the line. The employees are fast and efficient, and they run the place like a well-oiled machine.  I will definitely be back!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"This place is the REAL DEAL! Be warned, the line really starts to snake out the door around 9 am, so make sure you get there early. Menu spans numerous styles and flavors, with daily specials as well. The sweet crepes are outstanding, particularly the Nutella crepes. My wife got the Breakfast crepe and it was fantastic. A little pricy, but worth it. Clean and tidy place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Tourist trap. They are capitalizing on hotels in the neighborhood. Locals are not going here. Food is mediocre, serving size is small, price is high and wait is long. If you are looking for something convenient, then by all means. But let's not pretend that this place actually deserves the attention it gets. Look at my images and ask if you would pay $15 for these plates."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"What an outstanding little hole in the wall cafe. Was able to super customize my eggs Benedict order just the way I like it. Coffee is machine made, not great. The place is a little run-down, but that's part of it's charm. Food was good! Price was fantastic, felt like I got a killer deal on some killer food. Service was quick and friendly, cashier was super funny, and waiter was very kind. Overall a great little spot."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,This place was delicious!! Coffee was amazing & the service was quick. There are seriously some hard working women and men working here. It was super busy and they still kept up! 10/10 would recommend
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great breakfast, great value, could eat breakfast dinner and lunch here and never get bored.  Busy but quick friendly service"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The line of other tourists wasn't too bad and the line moved quickly. The eggs Benedict were good, however the line cook needs to slow down. Jovan found egg shells in his. Elouise enjoyed her salmon eggs and potatoes with ketchup. I did a couple of sides of 2 eggs and sausage which were standard diner fair."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Had the eggplant crepe with a side of bacon because, well, bacon! It was delicious. We liked the fact that you order and pay upfront and can leave as soon as you are done without waiting for the check."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The wait wasn't too bad and totally worth it for the dulce de leche crepe with banana, pecans, chocolate syrup and fresh whipped cream. I loved the service of them picking it the table rather than looking to find one."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The food was really good! The pancakes and eggs were delicious. I was happy that they have the chicken sausage as an option! We ordered for takeout breakfast. The food was done quickly and the staff was very nice. I would like to dine in one day as well.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Food was alright. My egg was not poached and was completely cooked. The  rancheros was a under seasoned. The crepe was a bit dry and I wish they would of put the cream on the inside to sweeten the stuff a bit
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Form at the cost of substance.  If you’re looking for your next jealousy-inducing insta post but care little (or are unable) to distinguish quality, you’re in the right place. Every plate looks seductive and delicious.  But for a dish meant to be delicate the crepe was thick and chewy, with a soupy filling hidden inside.  The eggs Benedict are carefully shaped, arranged, and plated, but the hollandaise is a sheer coating rather than a true saucy smothering. And the ham! Think “can”, not “deli”.  With the plethora of delicious food in the area, I won’t be coming here again."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Excellent breakfast, really busy though Staff is super nice"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Their crepes are a must. There are so many choices. Eden and Suzzette were our choices, and we were very pleased."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Food was delicious! Ordered the salsa crepe with side of potatoes. Line was super long though. Waited about 30 minutes before ordering and sitting down.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The pastas and burgers are really good! Different choices on the menu! Good deserts options! Tasty food!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"There was a long queue but it’s valuable enough to wait! I had french toast, egg plant crépe, bowl of soup and granola bowl with yogurt! Everything was great! Highly recommened for breakfast"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Great food!! Night club music from Sinaloa  at 7:30 in the morning is a little intense when you’re having breakfast with the fam bam.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The service and food here was top notch drink were made well and food arrived on time. The pancakes were just right and the fruit was very fresh.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,The food was lovely and the service was really good . Definitely will come back again when I’m next in SF.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I have been ordering food from this restaurant for 5 years now . I really enjoy their Crepes of all flavors .
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Very tasty, with a lot of options for everyone."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Food was alright. Price too. But the place a bit noisy and messy
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I ate French Toast from here, and while it wasn't as flavourful as I would have expected, I still enjoyed it. And the portion was a good size."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,One of my favorite places for breakfast anywhere. Crepes are always amazing and the service fantastic
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Crossaint was way bigger then expected which is good especially since it was so delicious vanilla latte was bomb too
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,We had an American breakfast: pancakes with strawberries and bananas- really tasty
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Sweet baby pancake 🥞 heaven. My lovely grandmother Martha from Finland, would cook what she called ""swedish pancakes"", for me and me only. I was her ""Erki poika."" Which means good boy in Finish. I loved her and the huge, thin, sugar toped rolls of swedish pancakes she made with love. Honey Honey cafe & crepes comes the closet to my grandmothers delights. Delicious!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The long line and wait time makes me say this place should get 1 star.  It was decent food..nothing outstanding, but I give them 3 stars because they had something green on the menu- spinach to the rescue!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We had a party of 7 and we all got something different from the menu. Every single dish was delicious. Service was amazing. The restaurant was packed, but we got our food really fast."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Wonderful place to have a nice breakfast or some tasty crepes! The place has cozy interior, beautiful old tiles on the floor. Food was delicious and staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The only good thing here is a service of a staff accepting orders. Food is not delicious and does not look good as well. The worst Greek salad I have ever tried, not even sure why doe they call this weird thing a Greek salad? They probably have another understanding of this salad. Probably crepes are good here, but my experience left me with never come back thinking."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I had the regular eggs Benedict and my wife had the salmon Benedict. Both plates good 4 out of 5. Their coffee however, is delicious! Due to Covid, seating is only outside. There’s a lot of homeless around this area. Needless to say, during our meal we had 2 individuals walk up to us and ask for some money. One guy had no shame, he asked for $50...lol... either way, I’m just visiting this area. I would try another restaurant prior to coming back to this one just to explore."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,This place is a true gem! Outstanding food and the best fresh squeezed orange juice I’ve ever had!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great breakfast, fast organized service. Already know what I'm ordering next time."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"We went there for breakfast, the place was very dirty (it was only 10am) and we saw the guy who serves the food stuck his finger into a maple syrup cup and then serve it to a Client. The food was cold, potatoes burnt. Not worthy at all to spend your money there."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"My favorite breakfast spot near Union Square. Unfortunately nowadays too many people know it’s a great place so expect long lines between 8:30 and 10:30a, especially on weekends. Good news: a) it’s still worth it, b) you can go here for lunch or dinner as well! :)"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Cute little corner café. Had the baklava crepes which were good but maybe too many walnuts for my taste. No biggie, though. The freshly squeezed orange juice was absolutely amazing."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I was overwhelmed with menu options. I was confused. I felt bad for holding up the line.  It was hard to see over the tables so preview menu before you go. I enjoyed my crepe and potatoes were yummy.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"There was a long line but surprisingly it wasn’t too long a wait. They’re really efficient, and even though it looks really packed, they somehow found me a table.  I got the salmon scramble with the strawberry kiwi banana crepe and OJ. The presentation of the salmon scramble was a little sad but it was good. Very generous portion of salmon in the scramble which made it worth it. But other than that, nothing too impressive or mind blowing. The crepe was a little disappointing though. I thought the fruits would be wrapped in the crepe afterwards so it’s at least a cool temperature. But the fruits are like hot and soggy, the texture was just not it for me. It’s also very sour but they do come with whipped cream or ice cream so that kind of balanced it out. I’m not sure I’ll come back for the crepe again, maybe something else… the OJ was freshly squeezed which was amazing but dang it’s hella sweet. Ask for ice to go with it to help balance it out a little.  Maybe I had too high of an expectation for the cafe before coming in, so it kind of fell short of what I would’ve hoped for. But overall, it’s good, but not like mind blowing good (at least for the items I got)."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,when i asked is any drink included in a breakfast he told me that no. but actually flavored water is for free. queue move fast. potatoes which goes as a side dish is overfried. toast overfried too. salmon was oversalted on my taste. maybe they used smoked salted salmon which became more salted after frying. if you decide to go i advise to order avacodo to toast. my experience was max on 3 stars
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Just left the hotel and stumbled on this cute cafe. I had the breakfast crepe. Staff is super friendly, ambience is great and walking distance from union square. Definitely recommend this place."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Came here for the first time and the staff are friendly and get you seated as soon as possible. Ordering is quick and simple. The freshly squeezed orange is a big hit for me and the chocolate waffle was gorgeous. Will be coming back again
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,My FAV WAS THE FRESH SQEEZED ORANGE JUICE.  My husband got the burrito and it was really good. Mine was eggs florentine and it was very spinachy. The nutella banana crepes was amazing!
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Underwhelming. Two out of the three crêpes we had were definitely sub-par. The savoury Salsa crêpe was nice because of the salsa itself, but the Torino (I think? It was feta, mushrooms & spinach) was bland and dry. The Blinz was the worst - half-baked and filled with sickeningly sweet strawberry and orange jams, no real fruit save for two lonesome strawberries that were put on as garnish. Cappuccino was poor, bit the lemonade was ok.  Also, I get they're keeping some sort of an image with the décor, and I liked the blackboard menu, but the rest of the place seems outdated and decrepit."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Lovely family owned restaurant and beautiful people. Delicious breakfast Benedicts and pancakes of course 😊
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Outstanding breakfast full of yumminess and seafood. Go here, but get here early. It gets packed and for good reason."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"I love this place. I try to go here every time I'm in San Francisco because it's simply wonderful in one of my favorite locations in the city. Highly recommended that you get there early because the place does fill up and there will be a line that may go outside, but it does move fairly quickly. Seating is pretty good for the place as people don't stay much past their time- but just be ready to wait for a seat in some instances. Even with all of that still highly recommended breakfast spot, but be careful since it does close fairly early."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,First time in here..will definitely be last... Very musky smell when I walked in ...put me off my food... Hot drink was cold..food was cold too Ordered toast the butter did not even spread well
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"The savoury Pesto crepes are quite big. Glad I got the bowl of fruit salad as the side. If you are very hungry then potatoes as a side, will fill you up."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"On Thanksgiving day in SF we wanted to find an open restaurant for an easy brunch and found this around the corner from our hotel. It was packed. I don't know if it's always that busy or if it was because of the holiday. We were wondering if we'd have to battle someone to claim a table, but they set us up and soon we were seated with our brunch. They had special sunrise scramble dish that was basically chilaquiles; it was awesome. I hope they make it a regular menu item."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Tried the eggs crab cake Benedict. It was okay, I had better ones before elsewhere, wasn't impressed. You have to queue to order your own food ( and the queue can get pretty long during peak hours ) Staff did not informed that that there's extra charges for credit card usage, I only found out after I looked at the receipt, would have paid cash instead."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Loved loved loved this place!!!! Super fast. Amazing food!!!!  We went back several times.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Great breakfast. It gets crowded fast though, so be there early!"
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Super nice staff. Good menu. We split the pesto crepe which was very tasty. The line is quite long.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, and great prices for such quality dishes. If you are looking for a good breakfast or brunch spot, I highly highly recommend."
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,Try to go early in the morning to avoid at least 30min queu.. breakfast are really tasty. I recommend the salmon benedict
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,I like that they offer ice cream as an option with the crepes! I had an SBK crepe and they accommodated my request for Nutella which was awesome.  The only con is that the bathrooms were a little dirty and not well maintained.
Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery,599 Post St,"Ate here for breakfast when I was on vacation. I seriously wanted to eat everything, the menu is huge and all the combos for crepes and omelettes sounded so good. The one I got had tomatoes, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. Omelettes also come with a side of toast (I got sourdough because, uh SF) and a small salad. I really enjoyed the salad dressing they used, it was light but had big flavor. I missed a big rush but the line was to the door most of the time I was eating so plan a lot of time if eating during peak hours. You order and then find any open table and they bring the food to you. Big groups might be tricky unless you're willing to split tables."
