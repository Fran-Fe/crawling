Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,Tomato basil soup is absolutely good.  The ham and egg croissant is also awesome.  The vegetable smoothie is wonderful.  Highly recommend order ahead so you don't miss out.
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,Thought $12 for this little guy buy I have to say it's pretty hearty and I am a fan of the tomato jam!
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,The employees are great they have wonderful hospitality always greet you with a smile positive energy a business you can go into and  come out with a smile.
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,Best brekkie burrito I’ve ever had. Great crew working there 🤙
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Finally found an open local bakery to have breakfast after walking a few block from our hotel. We had their French toast (which was Amazing!) and a Ham/Egg/Cheese breakfast sandwich on a croissant. I added avocado and was pleased to see half the avocado on it! Turned out to be a Great sandwich. I wasn't impressed with my double espresso, the espresso was sour/sharp tasting even with them adding some simple syrup. Overall, I'd eat here again.."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Favorite new bakery in San Francisco. What a fine, will definitely go back next time I am in the city. Healthy and yummy. Love the avocado toast and all the salads I tried were tasty. Yummy bread and delicious coffee."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Jane on Larkin is a hidden gem, although in one of the sketchiest parts of The Loin. The food is amazing and the service is always quality. I have eaten here probably 5-7 times so I’m always trying something new. The sausage biscuit is a personal favorite although not pictured below. I would say one this they need to be more efficient with is seating, the seats are just there with a first come style. Which works unless it’s really crowded.  This time I opted for the mission un-smoothie which was a solid breakfast burrito, could of had a little more flavor but the content of what’s in it gives it a solid B+.  The spicy baked eggs I would say is something you eat just to get you going for the day, not the most fulfilling meal, but delicious especially with the toast on the side."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Tried the peanut butter banana toast and the egg sandwich, both are solid choices. The staff was approachable and helpful! The space is airy and colorful. Would recommend for a quick breakfast."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Great location for breakfast & brunch. Freshly baked bread and croissants. Nice cappuccino. Rich menu including a choice of salads, toasts, some classics and a variety of healthy juices.  The staff is generally fast with taking orders and service, but this place can get quite busy around noon, so some waiting may be required to get a seat."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"I really liked the menu options they had! Sandwich had good flavor! I enjoyed the iced mocha, as well. Not the best coffee I've ever had but it was really good for non-coffee shop coffee. The blonde girl who took my order and brought me my food was very nice. The portion size is good, I only ate half the sandwich and was full."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Great little bakery in the Tenderloin.  Went early in a Sunday so not too sketch.  I had the almond milk chia pudding. It was unsweetened with berries,  tasted very good"
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"First time at Jane and we loved it. Delicious food, coffee, tea. The staff is very friendly. The bread is homemade. Avocado mash with poached egg, peanut butter and banana toast, fresh fruits and yogurt, everything is yummy."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,Great restaurants and have the best employees always greet you with a smile instead of attitude like quite a few places in the area.
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Thoughtful service, with Jane Bakery accolades clear in all their food, paired with great drinks (including chai and green smoothie). Fillmore spot a go-to w much better neighborhood as well."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Cheap and overpriced. $17 dollars smoked salmon toast used to come into two large pieces, now it’s just one small piece. Never again. Go waste your money somewhere else."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Stick to coffee, baked goods, and the sandwiches. Any cowboy would be ashamed to be associated with the cowboy salad. A more appropriate name would be the City Slicker Salad. The chicken was cold, didn’t taste like bbq, and the corn and beans were sprinkled on like salt and pepper. Last time I got the Club Sandwich, that was really good. Also avoid the rainbow salad. It’s basically spinach and carrots."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"First time !!! Ordered the turkey panine, sadly did not have turkey, got the next best thing ham. Delicious with the latte I got. Service was exceptional and fast. I need to try this place again."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"Wow has this place gone downhill! When I lived nearby a decade ago, this was a favorite cafe. No longer!  The food used to be delicious - now it's meh. No wifi, on purpose. Staff are cheerless and all wearing Covid muzzles.  Unsurprisingly, there were few customers."
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,This was a great coffee shop! I only got Chia pudding (amazing with tons of berries and granola and sweet pudding. Not to watery like most) It was reasonably  priced (for chia pudding in the city that is) and the staff were extremely friendly.  Friend got a coffee there and it was pretty good. Normal roast was a bit dark and not too sweet.  tables were nice and spread out with room to work on laptops or books easily and not be too disturbed.
Jane on Larkin,925 Larkin St,"A great bakery/coffee shop in the tender-nob area of San Francisco. They have a variety of delicious salads, sandwiches and AMAZING pastries/desserts!"
