Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Cute coffee shop with good coffee. Came here at 8am in the morning seeking sustenance after a strenuous HIIT workout at the gym nearby. Very quiet in the morning but the barista was so nice and beaming with warmth. Lots of seat space and outlets for working and wifi is available. Love the relaxing music and decor. Cappuccino was a bit pricier than expected at a little more than $6 a cup, but did not disappoint. Would definitely come back to try the food!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Bacon was burnt and food was overpriced for what we got. The drip coffee was also not very good. The atmosphere was quiet, which is good for laptop work, but if you want to have a conversation, everyone in the cafe will overhear you. Not a good spot for brunch unfortunately."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"$50+ for a sandwich, salad and 1 coffee! Used to love this place. The beetloaf sandwich is now $16!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great version of a local coffee shop / Cafe. Numerous solid menu items that have stood up for years. Programs is events and more. Veggie friendly, local beers too ."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Cute spot, good service. Food selection is a bit limited, but a good space to relax or work in. The back patio is lovely. The grilled cheese sandwich is solid but could use a stronger cheese."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This is my favorite cafe in San Francisco— the food is delicious and it has a great no-frills atmosphere. Whether you are vegetarian or not, you have to try the beetloaf— I’ve never had another sandwich like it. They also have a nice outdoor seating area and on Thursday/Friday nights they have jazz bands come in."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Those is a nice place to have a fast bite by yourself or with companions. It's a great spot to work as well. The ambiance is great. Generally speaking, it is pleasant, peaceful, and clean. There is some interesting, effective wall art. There is also an option for outside sitting. You absolutely must try the personal pizzas. Additionally, the salads are wonderful. It is undoubtedly vegetarian-friendly. The diversity of (non-alcoholic) drink selections is what makes this establishment great. The ginger lemonade is strongly advised (it is quite ginger-y). The golden latte is wonderful."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Friendly folks, good seating  Tried the mushroom coffee thing and it was kind of awesome -- smooth and creamy. stay in cups have large portions for the drinks. good food selection. charming spot overall!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Been coming to this place for 15 yrs. Sadly the quality of their coffees has gone down since their revamp a few months ago. Also it's a hit or miss with their baristas, need more training on how to make the drinks if you serve $5+ espresso drinks."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"A favorite spot to sit, read, work all while enjoying excellent coffee and a nice food menu. Have been coming here so long I can’t remember. One of the back in the day’s that has kept up with the Mission’s transformation."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,I dropped in at Atlas bc I was dyeing for a cold drink.  I was pleasantly surprised that they have 3 vegetarian/vegan sandwiches to choose from! I had the tofu & chard on toasted whole grain bread and it was wonderful!  The whole place was bright and cheery.  If I lived in this neighborhood I would eat here all the time.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I ordered from the app ""too good to go"" and was really disappointed.  I received a small container of soup and two pieces of bread.  The value of this was supposed to be $12 +  The premise of this app is that it's food that is going to be left over or go to waste, totally not the case.  It's just a marketing ploy to get you in the restaurant.  Everyone got the surprise soup which is just a regular staple of the cafe."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,The Yam sandwich is amazing 😍 Great atmosphere and back patio. Longtime neighborhood mainstay for good reason.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"One of my favorite cafe's to work remotely from. Great outdoor and indoor space, robust lunch menu, and wifi AND outlets??. Sad that's such a rare thing these days, but it's what makes Atlas cafe a safe bet for a remote workday."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Great cafe with lots of seating. Loved the golden latte and Cuban sandwich.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Pretty standard cafe fare with a few notable standouts: golden beetloaf sandwich, apples and goat cheese pizza, and the roasted yam sandwich. Quick service and a garden patio."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Comfortable chilled out cafe. Lots of seating.  Sandwiches 4. Service 4. Value 4. Coffee 4. WiFi, can be unreliable."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Medium roast coffee beans, great a atmosphere and plenty of outdoor seating. No wait either.  Nice vibe!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I'm not from San Francisco, but every time I visit the city I eat at Atlas Cafe. I love the atmosphere here and the staff is friendly. The food is great!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I’m always glad this place exists. While the surrounding neighborhood has gone increasingly upscale, Atlas Cafe is resolutely unpretentious. It has the feel of a college coffee shop, with a large amount of seating, where you can sit and chat, read, do work, etc. All the food and drink here is just okay, the pizza especially drab, but you go here because it’s uniquely chill, not because the food or coffee is particularly great (there’s so many other places for that in the area)."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Lovely place! The Beet Sandwich shown in the picture was simply delicious and quite hearty!
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Nice cafe in a neighborhood full of cafes and bars. Cool but not pretentious. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast, sandwiches, salads and pizza. Coffee, Italian sodas beer and wine.  I'll come back."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Visit on Saturdays at 2 pm for the best free stand-up comedy in the Bay Area
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The owner and staff are wonderfully helpful and offer a masterful selection of food and beverage. All aspects of this place hold quality at heart with heart. Every carefully selected choice builds an elegant atmosphere and still offers robust utility for the community and passers-by alike. On a more personal level, their housemade jalapeno pesto is straight fire, I put it on everything 🔥💯"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Smoked trout bagel or salad! Great patio and inside seating.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Have some vegetarian options. Really good and decent priced roasted yam sandwich. Most places don't add enough spice but this place does, so it's perfectly suited for Indian palette. I wish they had table service, instead of having to wait in a long queue."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,I love the vibe here! It's a great place to be productive and work remotely. It's also in. Good area. I love the outdoor patio and the in door space is comfortable and well spaced out too. I will make 2 concessions. The ginger lemonade IS NOT good and the chai IS NOT good either. I regret ordering both of those items.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The food here is decent, but it would be great if there were some more creative vegan options. Plant based milk choices include oat, almond and soy."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Those is a great place for a quick bite alone or with friends. It is also an excellent place to sit and work. The atmosphere is pleasant. It is generally clean, quiet, and welcoming. There is some unusual artwork on the walls which works well. Outside seating is also an option.  The personal pizzas are a must try. The salads are decent too. It is definitely vegetarian friendly.  What makes this place excellent is the variety of (non-alcoholic) drink options. The ginger lemonade is highly recommended (it is quite ginger-y). The golden latte is delicious."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Stopped here for a quick breakfast and the atmosphere was welcoming and warm. We almost walked past it because of how small and hidden it is. A bagel and latte was the perfect combo for this little gem. Their croissants were pretty dope too! Service was friendly and quick. I'd definitely stop here again if I am ever in the neighborhood.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Sandwiches are so good!  It's chill here and the staff is nice too.  Good place to spend time or get to go food/coffee
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This local Mission Cafe is truly a cool casual spot. Great for friend, families, a date with live jazz. Breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, beer & wine +. The menu is delicious, can't go wrong and a total value. The roasted yam sandwich is delicious, the beet loaf is freaking amazing, toasty sandwiches and crisp salads are fab. Love the charm of the laid back way the chefs yell your number when your food is ready. Dig the patio where folks can chill with their dogs."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This is such a great place.  They have excellent sandwiches, pretty standard bagels, and beer on tap. Their staff are also very hospitable/fun to talk to, and they have live jazz three nights a week.  If you are wanting something to do or a place to work, definitely come through here."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Atlas Cafe is a neighborhood-favorite bar and restaurant known for live music, an unassuming atmosphere and relaxed vibes. Not a place necessarily for fresh college graduates, however if you check your vibes at the door anyone is welcome.  Their menu is rather bland, typical fare for a ""New-American"" cafe of this style. My favorite is the Apple and Goat Cheese Pizza.  Atmosphere 5/5 Food 3/5 Drinks (limited selection) 3/5"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This place is great - lots of indoor, outdoor, and patio seating. Food and coffee plus VEGAN PIZZA! Wifi is available but not free (2hr password with a purchase). Located on a ""slow street"" and right next to other super nice cafes and restaurants. Really nice!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I used to come here a lot years ago and loved it.  I remember there being a wonderful patio that is dog friendly (which is still there) so when I moved back in May with a dog I came for a visit with a dear friend.  An 18 year vegetarian I ordered a pizza (that had ham in the recipe) to put ham on the side (for the dog).  They put the ham on the side and on the pizza, but since it was so finely cut and cooked it resembled the fried onion on the pizza and I did not notice until I ate a good portion of it.  That is what I get for trust.  However it doesn't get better. My friend ordered the beet salad and really loved it until she found a hair,  that I assure you, did not belong to us.  When I brought it to the worker who takes the orders, she simply said ""Sorry"", with no aspiration or concern to amend the situation.   The food is really great so it makes me sad because I used to love this place.  But please, go somewhere else for the sake of your own health safety.  Oh, and they don't refrigerate the almond milk so it coagulates and ruins your coffee.  I really wanted to make this my new favorite puppy spot but after this I just can't."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,I ordered the trout Bagel and black coffee. It was solid but not that special. I did enjoy that they had trout instead of salmon. I think that's supposed to be more sustainable. The staff weren't that hospitable but I get it in these times.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Atlas Café is one of those corner cafés that has created a reputation for itself by providing good food, and a simple but nice place to eat both indoors and outdoors. This is a place that locals meet and hang out. Not far from several performance spaces, you sometimes find dancers and actors here."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Lots of seating, clean bathroom, decent food. But very noisy."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I have a soft spot for Atlas Cafe since I first started going there back in the late 90s.  I'll never forget the first time I tried their yam sandwich...it was a memorable taste moment.  It's a great neighborhood spot with solid food and drinks.  I love the fact that they have outdoor seating and in general, prices are reasonable."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Nice atmosphere. Very friendly and attentive staff. A very good selection of magazines to browse, all current. Short waiting time. The Americano I had was not the best - too sour. Baked tofu sandwich was amazing! Strong smell of food - make sure you sit outside if you don't want your clothes to get smelly."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,I just love this place! It’s my neighborhood spot where I meet friends or hang out with my laptop. I bring my dog out on the outside patio. The people are always super friendly! The food is really good for a cafe. My faves are the pizzas! One of my faves in SF!
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"It's a friendly little place and the food is good. They manage to keep a good  varied menu with sandwiches, pizza soups and good deserts. The walled outside patio is nice when those windy afternoons make it to harsh to eat outside in the open."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I only get sandwiches and coffee here, but everything I've tried has been good.  The service is quick, and they offer an interesting variety of sandwiches with good vegetarian options.  The staff is always busy, so know what you want before you get to the cash register.  They will get annoyed if you don't leave a tip, so be a good patron and do it!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Atlas Cafe is a Great place to have food with friends and gossip. The atmosphere attracted me. They have a special kid-friendly environment. Enjoyed Smoked Trout, Smoked Trout Salad, and Apples and goat cheese pizza. Delicious menu loved it!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"good, consistent place to get some work done or grab a more leisurely lunch. There are some very innovative and solid menu items(beetloaf, no cheese pizza to name a couple). Prices are a bit high and expect to wait 20-30 minutes for a sandwich or salad, depending on the rush -- but you can always order online and pick up in-store"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,This is a classic spot with amazing salads and sandwiches. I've had everything on the menu and it's all divine. Great spots for outdoor and indoor eating.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"A cute vegan-friendly cafe in the Mission. I've tried the roasted yam sandwich, the apple grilled cheese, and the chocolate milk, and all of them were fantastic. It's also fairly spacious inside, but the table setup would make me skeptical of visiting with large groups. The place sells food, coffee, and beer, so it's a great place to chat into the night with friends and catch up. My only gripe is that it's a bit of a walk from the BART, but that's more of an issue with the neighborhood's layout than the actual restaurant."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Excellent bagels!  Used to love getting the Philz bagel until they changed suppliers and got those tiny puck bagels.  Got the same thing here but had them add bacon.  Will definitely be back!
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great place for tasty, unpretentious coffee, served with a blank stare. Food is generally overpriced and takes a bizarrely, frustratingly long time. Like, I've waited 45 minutes to get a $14-ish sandwich that barely weighed more than the two slices of bread it was on. Breakfast items are faster and pretty tasty. Used to get those on the regular."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Atlas is a classic. I'm happy to support this neighborhood icon.. and its super good. Love the steamed eggs, the pizzas, the coffee, the mimosas and atlas cooler. Veggie options suitable for carnivores. Toybox in the beautiful courtyard for the kiddos. Great owner/employer. And music!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I usually enjoy a coffee and sandwich here on weekends with varying quality and service which is fine considering the convenience. However, today while I was signing the receipt -- where I always tip --, the staff member tossed my copy at me while dismissively walking away. I didn't do anything to incite any negative behavior, but I tried to brush it off. Then I get my food, and it's incomplete. Again, not asking for incredible service. Just basic decency."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great neighborhood coffee place. The outdoor patio is especially lovely. I love that whether indoors or outdoors there is ample seating at Atlas. In addition to coffee they also have great salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. There are other coffee places in the area but this is a great one when you want to sit and relax for a bit over coffee and food."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Quick service and great place to get some work done from what I saw! It started filling up a bit around 2/3 (Thursday), but I tried going on a Tuesday around 1pm before and it was completely packed, so you may or may not need to wait/be able to get a table."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This is a great spot to stop in no matter what you're in the mood for or what time of day. Coffee and reading on a comfortable couch, a quick lunch by yourself, dinner with friends, or late night beers. They also have several vegan/vegetarian options. The staff is very friendly. Overall it's a neighborhood favorite!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This cafe is an awesome local business. They make great sandwiches (lots of veg options too) and are dog friendly. I love the golden beetloaf, one of the best veg sandwiches in SF in my opinion!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"It's become one of my favorite places to go before work , my favorite sandwich would be their turkey bacon avocado and of course their soup of the day is always a surprise"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Usually come here for coffee and the occasional sandwich. Coffee is good food is on par, and service is friendly. Nice outdoor area in the back, my go to spot when it gets loud or need a break from the tunes. Has that coffee shop feel you don't get from the chain stores."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"With so many hip/white walled/minimal cafes around the city, I'm always happy to discover a place more old-school and cozy place. I like to go here to get some work done. They have a lunch/dinner menu as well. You get 2 hours of free WIFI with a purchase."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"As for the food, I love it... It's yummy and tasty and I never feel guilty about eating whatever it is I ordered that day! For example, the last time I went I was absolutely starving... I ordered the grilled cheese with apples + the soup of the day (brussel sprout + squash + bacon = absolute deliciousness!), and a diet coke... All for the price of $11... I ate it all and was as happy as can be!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Their sandwiches are delicious and there is often artists playing some music, just enjoying their time at the tables. A real smooth atmosphere with great food! 👍"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"As far as cafes near my work, this place is reliable. I initially felt meh about this place but their hours are good and it’s hard to fine a cafe in San Francisco of this size. The back corner has outlets as well as the sofas and one outlet outside. There is ample seating. They have changed their rule to two hour WiFi with a code available on purchase. The baristas are very nice about remembering to offer it to you when you purchase something. Also with the culture of work from home, I can see how that would affect businesses so I’m not mad. This is a great place to meet with a friend because it’s not as quiet and awkward as some other places. The outdoor patio and tables on the side of the building are also really nice. PS turkey bacon avocado sandwich. PSS scrambled eggs can be ordered at breakfast without having to eat bagels or croissants #keto"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Atlas is one of the few places I love which has managed to survive the neighborhood development. Check it out and you'll understand why. Cool ambiance. Cool staff. Cool menu. Cool art. It's about as San Francisco as cafes come!
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Local haven for locals, families, students and artists. Has great salads, personal pizzas and sandwiches to eat. Has a magazine rack for reading and live music in the evening. Even has a covered outdoor patio for meeting. This place offers free Wi-Fi and power outlets. People are friendly food is great and prices are affordable."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Excellent place in The Mission! Fresh fruit! Lovely granola...
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I love Atlas cafe and especially the pop-up wine patio bar on the weekends. Delicious appetizers, local and imported drinks and impressive selection of DJs every other Friday."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Small unassuming place with exceptional coffee and unique breakfast/bagel choices. A large Americano should be on your order and the smoked trout bagel is heavenly. Get a Lyft here and enjoy the atmosphere that locals frequent, not tourists."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Love this cafe. The ambience is excellent for getting work done, and the vibe is laid back. Quickly becoming one of my go-tos. Food could be better hence the 4 stars, and the coffee is overpriced. Try a little harder on the sandwiches!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Been going to Atlas for 15 years and the place is a true Mission institution. Delicious unusual sandwiches (the beetloaf!) and the best backyard / outdoor seating to sip a latte on a sunny afternoon with a dear friend. Hope this place never closes.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,The menu is always the same and features things like hummus plate or smoke trout sandwich.  I can never quite find something to suit my tastes when I go but things are usually pretty decent.  Definitely pricey.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Amazing neighborhood cafe and the staff is incredible ❤️
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Good food, comfortable surroundings, and if there’s such a thing as a non-skeezy blockchain developer you’ll find them hanging out there."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Good salads, sandwiches, pizzas and bagels. Average expensiveness for the area. Coffee is so-so. A bit too burnt for my taste. Often quite busy. Outdoor patio is nice on warm days. Favorite item: The Atlas Cooler, a refreshing mix of ginger beer and beer."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Great outdoor patio with plenty of seating.They also have live music at certain hours which keeps this cafe interesting. Definitely a place with fast and clean service. I went here for coffee and stayed a bit to enjoy it outside.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Been here a few times. The food and coffee is good -- I really loved the beet salad. The ambiance is kind of meh -- every other minute the staff shout the order numbers that are ready at the top of their lungs. When they clean the dishes it's like they throw them from the tub into the sink as loudly as they can. Makes the environment kind of negative for me. Also, the wifi is super slow when it's busy.  Update: Downgraded to 2 stars since they don't update Google with their winter hours (so I showed up to find them closed). Come on!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Food is good, though their selection makes me wonder. They don't have staples, and what they do have is okay. I always feel hungry after going there. Their coffee is acceptable, but not as good as say Coffee Bar. I would never say no to going to Atlas Cafe, but I can't say there aren't better places in the area."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"A must go place in SF, especially when you visit Mission District (or live there). Had some Pizzazs and the Pastrami Sandwich - just perfect, very tasty! Listening to the Jazz Jam session was the cherry on the cake."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great place with REALLY excellent drip coffee for $3, and many vegetarian options. Great service, too - when I didn't make it clear what kind of coffee I wanted, the barista started over and followed my unusual request to a tee, even though it was probably my fault she didn't understand me in the first place. Keep up the great work!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,I've had a few pizzas and sandwiches here. They're very tasty. My only complaint is that the crust on the sandwiches is often burnt and not a real pleasant experience. I had the vegetable noodle soup once and it was amazing.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Stopped serving breakfast way before the time their menu says they do, and the cashier seemed to be a bit terse about it. Thereafter, I witnessed a breakfast item being cooked and served to someone. Not sure what to think about that... Also, there's a dearth of outlets for a coffee shop. Not a great look."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The crew behind the counter was attentive and also seemed happy. Maybe it was just a good day, but it totally makes the place when the staff seem upbeat about being of service and sharing a little TLC to the details. I like it here"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Try the Atlas Classic Tuna sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Many of the bagels and pizzas are equally tasty.  So, how to have a great lunch or brunch is easy: Grab these items and sit right on down at a table in the outside portion where it is almost always sunny.  Rinse and repeat.  You're welcome."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Really like this place it's comfy and warm. Inside and outside area. You can sit and read bring your laptop and work or drink and catch a buzz from 6:30-11 or eat some really good food. Prices are reasonable.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Atlas Cafe has a winning combo for me of a pleasant and clean casual atmosphere, friendly folks, jazz and tasty vegan options, oh and it's affordable and close to lots of goings on in the mission. Try the avocado and beet pizza. Do you have a 6 star rating? Here's one: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The night bar menu food and drink on its own is solid, but slightly expensive, which would make Atlas a 4/5. But the community vibes and live music make it a 5/5.  Find a weekend day, grab a book a drink and a snack and enjoy the vibes."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great food and lovely atmosphere! Get a coffee, a pastry, and sit in the patio in the back."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,They make the sandwich exactly the way I want it breakfast sandwich lightly toasted wheat with the crusts cut off half a slice of cheese turkey and egg I become a little bit attached to this the past two weeks but the athletic lady who fixes it fixes it perfect and that's why I come back I recommend getting that in particular sandwich just the way I make it best sandwich in the city
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"been going here for over ten years. a good spot for drip coffee. espresso is okay. the food menu is decent, and this is the only place in town that ive had steemed eggs on my bagel!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I've only come here for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  I would say this place is cute, but not a 'brunch' place in the city. You come here to get a bagel or something pastry-esque to eat, and then you have your cup of coffee. It's not very crowded, but it's also not a place where you'll be waited on, have a great selection for food, etc.  Come here if you live in the neighborhood and want to avoid long lines!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great sandwiches, decent french press coffee and a very peaceful atmosphere."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The cuban sandwich was so good.  The bread was perfectly toasted, crunchy, not burnt or too hard. Cheese was melty.  The yam sandwich was warm, perfectly naturally sweet.  Tahe asian side noodle was ok.  I didn't like tge souoy dressing, but I can taste the cashew bits.  Great place to hang out."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great food. A little pricey. But they get a 1 star because the iced tea is $3 and there are no refills. I asked why, and I was told ""everything costs"". Well, it ""costs"" 22 cents to make a gallon of iced tea. You're just being petty when you charge $3 AND don't refill it."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Atlas Cafe is a wonderful neighborhood gem. Unpretentious, timeless, and full of character. You can enjoy a great Espresso drink while talking with your friends in the sunlit terrace, or grab a magazine and read in solitaire. If you're a dog owner, enjoy a table outside while your dog sunbathes."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The perfect all-around café. If there's one place I'll miss after leaving SF, it's's Atlas. Grab a beer, a coffee, breakfast, lunch or dinner, indoors, outdoors, sit there for a few hours, just pop in for a second, hear some live music, you can do it all here  Only cautions: if you sit there for a long time, your clothes will smell a little smoky later. Also, don't get the eggs (they're steamed, which isn't great) but everything else on the menu is good (especially the spicy chicken pizza and soups!)"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Sense8 season 1 episode 7 was shot here, which is more than enough for me 😊 The atmosphere is very nice inside. However prices were a little bit much for me. Other than this,  it was great! …"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Ordered to-go twice: pizza and a ham sandwich. The pizza was bland but I ordered cheese so no fault of theirs. The ham sandwich had baby tomatoes (tasty!) but was a bit burned.  Overall: fast, filling, and pretty inexpensive!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Friendly staff and good coffee. I like the food: try the pizzas and sandwiches.  They have 2 nice outdoor seating areas.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"This area in the mission has definitely seen a growth of small restaurants and bars, Atlas is a genuine article in the sea of trendy things in the mission. Decent coffee, tasty breakfast and lunch options, lots of space, and medium fast wifi. I long for the days when this area was a little less happening."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Surprisingly delicious food for a cafe. I'd recommend almost anything on the menu based on what I saw, but the cookies and cream cookie and the Cuban sandwich were especially good. Loved the outdoor seating too."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The guy who served me was very pleasant, the trout salad was delicious, the chai I had was also perfectlylly made, however the beet salad had weird dry chewy beets—but I think it was an outlier to the norm. Overall very happy, and I'll be back"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The best thing I tried at the Atlas Cafe was the Golden Beetloaf sandwich. I don't eat meat so the patty was interesting to see (definitely looked like beef) but it was totally made of beets. I also had a ginger lemonade - I love ginger so it was a really refreshing beverage. Atlas Cafe also has live music on some days, free personalized wifi and a greenroom area in the back where it's really peaceful to study."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Fun, chill neighborhood cafe with live music, comfy couches and outdoor seating. Good for studying, working on your laptop, or relaxing with a beer, tea or coffee. Come on a sunny afternoon, enjoy the live music and get a table outside."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"I live across the street from here, and I've come here on and off, mostly for coffee. I've been there occasionally for live music at night, but I was under the assumption that they didn't have a liquor license. Well, it was apparently a mistake to ask on a sunday morning, because the woman at the cashier rudely answered that they did serve alcohol and then walked away, acting busy and completely ignoring me and my husband for the next five minutes. It was really awkward. Perhaps its my fault for expecting a ""sorry, i have to take care of such and such"", or something resembling politeness and friendliness. If they used to be cool, they're certainly pretentious now. Sightglass is much, much better. You want to go there! And, if you want food, there are lots of great places to eat at alternatively, but progressive grounds is probably the closest equivalent."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,The roast beef sandwich is really good. And there is a nice back patio area that is dog friendly. Don't bother with the pizza.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Came here because I saw it on 'Senses 8', a programme on Netflix. It was a lovely setting with wifi for 2 hours, indoor and outdoor seating. Food looked delicious and was around $10 mark. The staff were friendly and helpful. Tea range is great, coffee is fab and they have alcoholic drinks (beer, wine) and one of the biggest ranges of kombucha- they do a delicious green tea kombucha! Would recommend to go here for either catch up with your friends or studying! Has been around for 20 years so well established and knows what's up."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"A little pricey and the ""cash discount"" policy is weird, but Atlas has the best hours of any cafe in the area, tasty sandwiches, and the staff is friendly.  Keeps me coming back."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"In a building tucked away behind warehouses and homes lies Atlas. At Last! I've finally found it is how you'll feel when walking around the corner wondering where you're headed. Once you get inside you'll know you've come to the right place with prices that are up anyone's alley. I usually get the Egg Steamers on a bagel - to die for and under $4!  On nice days try and steal a spot outside in their back patio but they have windows looking out so inside isn't so bad either.  Atlas offers a wall of magazines to choose from so if you just need to get away from home and sit with other like-minded people, check out Atlas Cafe."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Love Atlas café! one of the last spots in the Mission that remind me of the old San Francisco I used to love so much. Great jazz, great salads and the best Ginger lemonade."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Nice place to settle in and get some work done, friendly service. I often come here to meditate about the deeper meaning behind the hit 1996 film The Nutty Professor, is it meant to symbolize the struggle between the conscious and unconscious, chaos and order, the weight of society and the modern epidemic of loneliness and a need for meaning. Plus there's free WiFi here!"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Jacob was awesome!!! We loved the chai and the chocolate chip cookies! Loved the vibe and atmosphere
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Went there for a meeting and decided to grab a almond cappuccino and a tune salad before the meeting. They were both delicious and they prepared them really fast. Looking forward to going back!
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Great cafe! Breakfast and lunch. Espresso Sandwich  Salads pizza breakfast items My favorite item on the menu is that goat cheese yam sandwich and a Ginger lemonade freshly squeezed
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"It's inexpensive compared to other places, but the serving sizes are also very small. Fun crowd. The cashier with some serious bangs had some serious attitude! 😳 …"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The food is top notch, the service is good sometimes, poor others; It's a gamble who will wait on you. They should turn down the crappy punk rock music too."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"A coffee shop that's been around before the neighborhood became hip.  I usually visit here to get coffee and sandwich to go. Only sat inside few times. They have lots of seating available, inside and outside, where you can catch up with your friends or work away on your laptop."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great coffee, plenty of outdoor seating and there was a great comedy show going on."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The Turkey, Avocado, Bacon sandwich was a perfect lunch!  There is outdoor door seating as well."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Great lunch spot. On a sunny day, it's a great place to sit and work outside. Make sure you try their drink, The Dirty Bunny. I could tell you what it is, but then I'd have to kill ya. :)"
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"The grilled cheese sandwich took forever before it was ready, and even then only because we nagged them about what took so long. But it's nice to have access to so many magazines while waiting"

Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Good food, chai, etc. I love this throwback to 90's cafe culture. Weekly live jazz music and plenty of outdoor seating are enjoyable aspects of this place."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Wifi and cellular so bad that I had to leave. Also the young man behind the bar was really rude to people there. It was weird. I haven’t seen a waiter so rude to everyone in a long time.
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Nice little cafe.  More lunchplace-ey than coffeeshop-ey, but, well, not every cafe can survive on people buying a $2 coffee every few hours while they sit on their laptops, or worse, scribble in notebooks.   Which is too bad."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Good coffee, breakfast, sandwiches, pizza, cozy seats near book and magazine stand, local art, indoor and outdoor seating. Great place to read, work, study, hang, chat."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"No frills cozy spot for the neighborhood. Food is often long to get, but decent. Place to stay for over an hour instead of a quick bite."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,Extremely rude to not update your holiday hours on google. How on earth was I supposed to know you’d be closed on 7/5?

Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,These folks are just awesome across the board!
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Free wifi for two hours with every purchase, the food is a little pricey but it is good. Also a great space to work in for homework or just work in general"

Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Relaxed vibes, delicious coffee, really tasty tuna melt and egg/cheese croissant. This place never fails."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"Food is good, but when street urchins walk in, hang out and sleep on the benches inside and don't leave, it's a place I'm not coming back to.  I know this is SF, but this is typical of why I don't like coming into SF all that much anymore."
Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,One word: disorganized.  Getting food out of the kitchen is the worst

Atlas Cafe,3049 20th St,"It looks like an old local coffee shop. I heard that there was no place to wait for a while. The outdoor terrace is still cold, so I can't sit down, Sofas and furniture are old. Broccoli soup comes with bread, but the soup is not creamy and tastes like soup. It doesn't come out boiled like Korean soup, so I feel like I'm eating cold soup. Still, it's been a while since I came to the US and eat vegetables for breakfast. I am still a novice traveler to the US who is worried about tip selection."
