Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"We ate lunch here on a busy Saturday afternoon during the Taiwanese Cultural Festival. My cappuccino was excellent and way better than any Starbucks or other coffee shop. The iced coffee was superb. We also ordered 2 pizzas, a croissant, and a raspberry tart. The pastries were delicious. The service, however, was the big winner. The man who served us (twice because I came back later for more drinks) was SO nice and friendly and sweet."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Julio, an amazing, thoughtful man. A tourist in distress, he took control of the situation and helped me. I had lost my phone which had all my id and credit cards slotted in my phone case. I went back to Union Square Coffee where I thought I left it.  I hadn't.  To make a long story short, Julio helped me with changing my phone status to lost by using my friends phone, hooked me up with the bus tour manager nearby in case I lost it there...called the mobile police station, he was awesome. I was in a bit of a panic, Julio was so comforting.  Excellent coffee too! We had an Americano, a cold brew latte, a chai tea...all fabulous.  A great little piece of Union Square, be sure to stop by!"
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"What a gem! Wonderful service, tasty coffee, and can't beat the location. We enjoyed a snack and drinks looking out onto Union Square, just in time for a lunch concert that was fabulous. Would love to come back for a champagne mimosa or a premade vodka spritz. Lovely!"
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"I work at an ophthalmology practice right across the street and after working a long morning, and I left the office and brought my lunch over to this place. I figured I would get situated before ordering a latte,  and out comes this employee yelling at me that there is no outside food allowed. Like, ok, way to approach someone, first off. Secondly, she could have told me this as she had seen me walking to a seat with my meal in hand rather than waiting til I brought everything out, walking over to me and yelling at me twice. This place needs better customer service. I’ll take my business to Starbucks around the corner where the coffee isn’t overpriced and actually tastes pleasant. I will definitely steer our patients clear of this place."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Though a bit pricey, the coffee and pastries were tasty. If your visiting the area and looking for a place to relax from walking all morning, check this place out and treat yourself."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,Pleasantly surprised by how good the farmers market salad with chicken was! Great for a quick tasty lunch. Raspberry tart was also delish.
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Paid $7, before tip, for a chai that was priced at 5 something. It was almost all milk. I paid for a $7 iced milk. Lesson learned."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"I hate posting bad reviews but training and system management need improvement. I’m excessively tolerant of holiday traffic and mishaps but this was ridiculous.  Ordered 2 bagels cream cheese.  Waited 30 minutes. Asked what the problem was after 15 minutes- we could clearly see that our order was not in the board, told there was a “small problem” with the printer and they were making them “now.”  We continued to watch person after person get served their orders, including bagels! Watched the workers run the bagels thru the toaster multiple times because no one has trained them to turn the heat up.  When we finally got our food, it was tasty though my bagel was barely toasted.  Needs management- not a phrase I usually say."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,A good place to grab a coffee and sit in the middle of Union Square. Staff pleasant. Bit pricey.
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Dirty tables. Very average coffee, and oily croissant. With this service you shouldnt expect tips! One coffee+tea+croissant costs 22 dollars."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Tasty coffee and donuts though a bit pricey, which makes sense considering the location. Place is very popular with birds too."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Good coffee, good food, right on the park, lovely small coffee shop, nice people attending the place, stop by and enjoy a nice cup of coffee and some baked good"
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,The stalest $5 croissants & bagels. They let us trade for the fruit cup & cookie. Everything is old & stale & definitely not worth the high price tag. Coffee was just okay. Wish we waited and went someplace else.
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"Not sure if I should be offended. I order an espresso macchiato, the owner or manager, not sure of who he was, asked me if I knew what a macchiato was, keep in mind my husband and I were speaking Italian. After he continues with the assumption that I don't know what a macchiato is he takes the time to explain it to me, I reply politely "" ok, thanks"" . He took it the extra mile to clarify in case I didn't notice that this place wasn't a Starbuck. ???!!! My thoughts"" WTH"" The coffee wasn't very good."
Union Square Coffee,350 Powell St,"I ordered unsweetened chai latte but they served me a sweetened one. When I went to ask if they made a wrong order, they said, “chai is sweet”. 1. Why don’t you tell me when I place the order then? 2. I’m pretty sure other coffee places serve *unsweetened* chai."
