Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Simple Pleasures is a mainstay in the Outer Richmond. The roast their own coffee, their vanilla iced lattes are my personal favorite, baked goods are so good, the space is great so you can chill or work, they have an outdoor parklette, and they serve beer later in the day. I love this place."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Quintessential San Francisco locals spot in the outer Richmond. Great coffee, hot chocolate with whipped cream and they have beer and wine as well as a parklet and outdoor seating."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Cute little, pet-friendly cafe. Very weak mocha and latte though. The veggie and flavored cream cheese pumpernickel bagel was decent. Everything bagel is even better."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Come for the coziness, not the cappuccino.  As others have said, this is a great cafe, incredibly cozy and with friendly staff.  That said, they are really bad at making cappuccino. I'd recommend Coffee Movement or Home Coffee Roasters for that."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Truly Simple Pleasures. Great coffee. Relaxed neighborhood atmosphere. I also tried the bagel+egg sandwich=not the best. Eggs were a bit sulfery from being old and added ham one thin slice for $3 ?? Still 5 STARS because it was just a great place. Simple and Pleasurable.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,This cozy cafe is a community favorite and is always busy. There is both indoor and outdoor seating bit I prefer to sit inside since Balboa is windy most of the time. Their hot sandwiches are really good and unique. I definitely did not expect the jalapeno in there. The dutch crunch is best enjoyed when the bread is still crunchy. Their pastries are also really good though they are kind of pricey. Wish they put the names and prices of their pastries up front.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"I've been coming here on a weekly basis for more than 20 years now. Ever since I was in high school. Simple Pleasures Cafe is the epitome of the local coffee shop. They roast their own coffee beans two doors down from the cafe so it is always incredibly fresh and delicious. They also serve amazing food, which includes sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries. I have eaten pretty much everything on the menu and it's all very good, but I am particularly fond of their chicken panini sandwiches, breakfast bagels, and egg salad. I most frequently order the mocha with soy, but if I'm in a hurry, the regular coffee (and iced coffee) is fantastic as well. The regular coffee there has strong notes of chocolate with subtle undertones of caramel. It's very satisfying and always puts me in a good mood. I've known many baristas come and go over the years and they've all been wonderful human beings. The ones I've known the longest who still work there are legitimately some my favorite baristas ever. They're always very friendly, generous and helpful. The owners are also amazing people. They're some of the kindest people I've ever known and are so appreciative of all their customers. They've maintained the cafe with the same decor and vibe since they opened decades ago. It is a fixture of the neighborhood and it genuinely feels like a home away from home."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This coffee shop always has such good vibes. Good coffee, friendly workers, and places to sit and look around at everything on the wall. We enjoy our time here when we come!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Quaint cozy local neighborhood coffee shop. Espresso machine. Hearty breakfast sandwiches and burritos. Wine and beer. Great outdoor seating area and indoor couches. Games to play with friends!!!
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Coffee here is great! Food could be better
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Stopped by for a coffee break after a quick hike at Lands' End nearby. Decent coffee and mocha. It's a cool place with perhaps an older crowd who look to be regulars in the neighborhood. Two thumbs up for open outdoor seating by the side walk.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great for hanging out with friends, working or chill afternoon by yourself. They're offering all kinds of coffee and hot beverages (love their chai latte btw!), beer, wine, sangria, anything you might want to drink. I'm not really familiar with the food over there but I loved the cookie. Don't expect something fancy but the place has good vibes!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This place is a gem. Best chai latte in town. If you like to support family owned, local, legacy establishments then this is the place to patron. The owners are lovely people with huge hearts. The staff is a diverse group of hard working individuals. This is my place to study, sit outside and people watch, or chat on the couch and make a new friend. It spans generations and is as cozy as a cafe could get. If you have lived in SF your entire life, or are new to town you always feel like a local at simple pleasures."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Delicious lox bagel! They really pack that full of awesomeness it won't leave you hungry. I would recommend. 🤤 I definitely need to make my way back for one. …
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Great neighborhood spot for some coffee or a bagel. On a nice sunny day grab a beer and enjoy outside in the parklet
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Awesome breakfast spot in the City. Cozy place with good vibes. Great Indoor and outdoor seating. Super casual place with great food and drink selections. Pastries, bagels, sandwiches, coffee, beer...so good. I  had a Drakes Pilsner with a lox bagel.  I'll def be back!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Not thrilled with a few things but the food is good, but really need hot sauce on my egg and cheese bagel. The pecan treats are amazing though!  They have unmasked people in both sides of the door violating the 6' requirements. I was told I couldn't even look in the back but who I think is an employee is just chilling there?  Dry an example. Don't be hypocrites"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Simple pleasures is literally the most hip place in the Richmond. Michael Conlin-Elsen made our night! You have the best staff in the world, thank you for being a neighborhood institution."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Amazing coffee taste (I got caramel latte) And a raspberry ring that’s a little bit too sweet Cozy interior, books, outlets. People are working on their laptops or reading"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Love the cafe atmosphere and the outside seating. Their pour over is incredible! My favorite spot to grab coffee in Outer Richmond.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This morning my son and I went for a walk on the beach and after working up an appetite we found this place and decided to get coffee, plus breakfast sandwiches and to be honest with you they were just delicious.  Very tasty and lots of options to choose from. Small place, but has plenty of room inside and out front.  Friendly, respectful, courteous staff.  Highly recommend this place. There is nothing like freshly roasted coffee early morning!! Thank you, my son and I enjoyed our experience  at your Cafe. Check it out, oh be patient there might be a line."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Great spot for morning coffee! Good prices and big selection of pastries. Would love to come back again!
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"WHERE'S THE OLD SCHOOL SERVICE? seems like a mom-n-pops, but sure doesn't act like one  I was there over the weekend* for a simple cup of coffee, and I requested a pup cup for my dog. For those of you that don't know, a pup cup is a bit of whipped cream in a cup. They charge $0.60 and I'm fine with that despite other cafes we frequent not charging. What I wasn't fine with was, after I forgot to tip (and I felt bad about that. I'd been carrying multiple bags that day and there was no counter space to assist in completing the payment transaction and then I had two cups more to carry), I see on my credit card bill that someone had tipped for me. It wasn't even that they tipped themselves $2 on a $3.10 bill (8 oz coffee and the pup cup) when I would have tipped $1.  The problem is that they tipped themselves at all. On principal, and ethically, and even legally: this is wrong.  I was even saltier about it because the last time I was there I showed up hungry and watched order of food after order of food being made, but not mine. I was patient because maybe there was something going on, like phone-in orders, that I didn't know about. Then the woman who ordered in-person 15 minutes after me got hers, and the guy making food was making his own and about to go on break. I was hangry by the time he scrambled to make mine quickly.  I'm generally feeling discouraged by the people working in this shop. The service is inconsistent. And just like any segment of society, some people are more ready to take responsibility while others' first reaction is to defend themselves.  *Note: This post was left as a draft for several weeks until today, Halloween 2022, simply because I was walking by and wanted to sit down with a cup of tea. I actually confronted the staff, one of which was the sandwich maker guy aforementioned. The other was a young woman who appreciated my attempt to confront them before leaving a bad review. She knows the value of receiving feedback. I appreciated her. The other young man made zero attempt, words or otherwise to right his actions.  Where's the old school service in this technology-ridden town?  Also, this shop does not have an ADA compliant/accessible restroom."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great location and cool vibe, food is pretty good, coffee is excellent and nice for a beer in the afternoon. Plus they have a great playlist:)"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Such a dope ambience and the coffee and pastries are such a delicious treat..You can just go there and spend a day.. luckily when I went I heard Pink Floyd songs..Now tell me .. Don't you wanna go there?
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"SUCH a cozy, comfy atmosphere. They serve booze, they serve coffee, they serve bagels! What more could you want!?"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,I like to place it’s so cozy!
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,I enjoyed this place! Went here daily when staying with my sister in the neighborhood. Was definitely worth walking the few blocks.  Good bagels
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Such a great old funky and wonderful place for coffee, good food, smiling staff, great live music, friendly neighborhood folks, and ""contentment"" for a minute - or for the whole day long!  If you live nearby, Simple Pleasures will be your hangout.  If you're from out of town, find parking and come on in! 😅 …"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,We have always loved Simple Pleasures...as do many others. It's clearly popular with the locals but we travel the approx 12 minutes to get there we always find parking somehow.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Arriving sleepy before a coffee I paid $38 plus tip for two lox bagels, one with capers, one small coffee and one medium coffee. After I woke up I asked the 'dude' who served me why it was so expensive he replied "" that's how it is these days!"" A nice girl tried to break it down and explained that the bagles are  $12.50 each. Well that would explain $25 but not why two coffees were $13. I hope ""that's the way it is these days"" doesn't mean ripping off customers or not admitting that you made a mistake. After living on the neighborhood for 3p years this will be my last visit to a coffee shop I've supported over the years."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Cool place, great tea offering"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great atmosphere, hippies and hipsters United!  Inside and outside sitting, whether ur doing homework or just have some free time you have to stop by here if you are in sf. But wait there’s more free book exchange, self serve water, great music, lasagne, quiche, beer, weird but awesome spot. Lol only in sf. Would’ve gave five stars if it wasn’t for the non smiling non existent customer service from the girl who took my order."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Garlic bagel with cream cheese and veggies. Was surprised by the variety of veggies on the bagel: pepperoncini, olive, lettuce, tomato, onion, spinach and cucumber. Decent price. I'd come back 👍🏻 …"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This is my favorite cafe in all of San Francisco. If you want a cafe with imported pour overs and $8 croissants, this place is not for you. Instead here, you'll find a true neighborhood establishment. Their coffee is all dark roast, but manages to be a pretty good one at that! And the vibe of the cafe is second to none. Relaxed, unique, and cozy. Give them all your $$$."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Really light, soft fluffy croissants"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Nice neighbourhood cafe. Had a couple of beers before a movie down at the Balboa. Saw they had an open mic on Thursdays. Nice folks. Nice place
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Wish I Could put ZERO STAR! Ordered a chia latte but taste super water down...as if I'm drinking water plus tea nothing else...very disappointing... Breakfast burrito taste like frozen lunch box just threw in a cooker to heat it up....a 3 year old can do it too....probably taste better than this nasty burrito and nasty water down chai tea latte...what a let down! When I went to let the barista know how water down the drink was, the male barista told me they are running out of the chai that's why it tastes weak and water down. It is totally false advertisements: you sell something that you are not able to make! What a joke!  oh BTW the short red hair young female cashier/batista has some attitude just like the food they serve..nasty and unwanted!  🤮 Spend $31 for the  subpar service and  nasty food I've ever had! Do not recommend this place! Save yourself some money and go to Starbucks where you get better service and better quality of food."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,The people are INCREDIBLE! I was lucky enough to have my order taken by a wonderful  employee. People here are so kind and welcoming.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great neighborhood community spot for coffee, snacks and lunch with a choice selection of beer and booch on tap to enjoy on those beautiful (and sometimes rare) Outer Richmond afternoons and sunsets. Eclectic array of tables to get work done or craft that novel you’ve been meaning to write. Always good playlists, and in the before times, live music to soothe the soul."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Family owned business/ friendly staff / community kindness is rare ...this is definitely a lovely place to grab a cup of joe !!
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"After taking my doggo to the vet, I got a latte.  It was one of those days and i got a large....it was $4!!! Honestly, i was so shocked it was so cheap- I am used to paying a lot more AND it was delicious! Not to mention, the people there were super sweet....thanks for making my morning!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"I used to come in here about once a week until a few months ago they started hiring a bunch of JIT (Juvenile Inconsiderate Trash) Tenney boppers that made my usual sandwich; a turkey pastrami salami combo (that I made up).. with literally one slice of of each meat, When it used to be a Katz deli sized portion. They didn't put any vegetables or cheese.  My fiance suggested that we give them another try and we were beyond and impressed actually it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in the Bay area.  We were very lucky to find Lisa greeting us warmly... And after a few sips of old Rasputin my sandwich was made and it was a dream come true."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Good prices, excellent bagels"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Cozy, welcoming coffee house with great baked goods and delicious bagel selection. They roast their own beans a few doors down and you can taste the quality."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Great spicy chai - communal tables
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"I like the business and people. But its better for folks who dont have any worries about getting covid. They stopped requiring customers (including those waiting in lines and not yet eating or drinking) and apparently employees too from wearing masks even way before the requirements recently were reduced re masking. I , myself and friends have been in there a number of times in the past few months and no one has ever  checked vaccination status (or testing results). (Assuming, perhaps, they do want employees to mask up,, apparently management does not carefully monitor this , so employees follow their own rules, and don't mask when they don't feel like it). I used to love this place, but sorry cant go in there now because of my risk factors and the laisse faire policies."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This place is a Richmond institution. They’ve been here for several decades and it shows. The interior has an eclectic texture that gives you a lot to look at. The baristas know most of the people that come in, and the regulars fill the front room with colorful commentary on current events. The coffee here is roasted on site and is fantastic and they get a wide array of fresh baked goods delivered every morning. As the day goes on, you can also grab a beer and sit outside in their parklet out front. There is something for everyone at Simple Pleasures. You can hunker down to work for a few hours, or chat about the news with your neighbors."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This coffee shop is extremely overrated. Due to the parklet directly outside the shop’s front doors, Simple Pleasures appears to be a popular stop for a cup of joe. However, as a local I know it’s the same revolving door of people who come to spend their entire days in front of the store - patrons or not.  As for the coffee it is mediocre. Again, as the environment caters to coffee drinkers and seems busy a people will still line up and wait to say “it’s”, or “not that bad”. Burnt and/or mediocre coffee will surely taste better if you’ve waited outside on a balmy Richmond day.  Where I am most disappointed is management and staff. I have ordered from and seen management operate and it’s the furthest thing from the “chill” energy they try to portray being filled with. I have been rushed to order, (ie. questions are met with a look of disdain. As for management of the building - blasting favorite playlists of whoever’s iphone is connected is not conducive to a coffee shop nor its customers. Country and rock one minute, pop and best of the 70’s the next? Rather than fighting over playlists, please Simple Pleasures, focus on training management and staff to be friendly and considerate of their customers - as well as roasting a GOOD cup of coffee, not just A LOT."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great coffee, modest prices for the area. Swung by on vacation on recommendation of a local friend. She said the scone was amazing, I didn't try but based on the Cafe Mocha I had I would recommend to all."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great spot to grab a quick bite or a cup of coffee, especially good if you find yourself stranded from other restaurants nearby that are over capacity. The layout of the place is only ok as the counter is in the middle of the floorplan making the lines crowd the place, but head to the back to avoid the small chaos. Small outdoor seating arrangement in front when the sun comes out."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great around-the-corner cafe. The coffee is meh, but the ambiance is great -- especially with live music in the evenings.  As a so-cal export, I was surprised when I came here and all the cafes were selling beer and wine! But now that I've become accustomed (and it didn't take long), I could never go back to my old ways of beer-less coffee shops.  Dogs welcome. Conversations with cute strangers likely."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"I like this place a lot. Good espresso drinks, some great pastries. Everyone who works here is nice. The atmosphere is artsy and chill. The outdoor patio is cool. Place is cash only with an ATM inside."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Been going here for decades. Friendly staff, great coffee and pastries, and had awesome live music in the before times. Nice little parklet area to sit and sip."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great coffee, selection of pastries is pretty limited. They have good sandwiches and a great front outside seating. Music periodically."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"A neighborhood favorite that serves as a town square of Balboa Village. Charming, warm, inviting with wonderful food and drink. The Italian pastries are delicious. Coffee is hand roasted next door for the freshest cup."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,The people were super nice! And the space was cozy and welcoming. Wish we could’ve stuck around enjoying the vibes
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"The vibe might be a little ""hipstery"" for some crowds, but regulars (those of us that live in the Outer Richmond district) are always treated like family. The coffee is amazing and the food (sandwiches, bagels, etc) isn't half bad. There is live music most evenings - a great place to hang out with friends!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Simple Pleasures feels like an old tavern - a wooden bar, vintage lamps and bookstands, and even an upright piano in the back. Most importantly, the coffee is great! I got a 12oz soy latte for $4. Not bad!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Yeah I like coming here. It's pretty chill and the locals are… pretty chill. I've been coming here for an easy 20 something years. The vibe has always been pretty good.  Coffee is good.   Cups are tiny.   My only issue.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,A small cozy cafe. Free WiFi lots of seating and nice music. I ordered a hot chocolate and caught up with an old friend. There's a piano for anyone who wants to play and boardgames too! I'd be a regular if I lived in the area.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Aside from the local cigarette smokers that meet and ride bicycles that sit right out front and puff away the place is pretty decent. Sometimes i feel like smacking the cigarette out of their mouth. Maybe one day i will..rude people. Recommend getting a bagel with bacon and cheese. Coffee is strong and bitter.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"excellent, cafe roasted coffee! friendly service, nice neighborhood vibe, funky yet comfortable setting. definitely will come back for coffee. missed the live music in the evening"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great neighborhood spot for coffee,  a wide selection of food, and sweet treats.   Highly recommend!  They have an outdoor seating area as well"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Food and coffee was okay but the staff was extremely rude. I ordered four breakfast bagels and they made a huge deal over having to make multiple bagels. They then proceeded to complain about it to other customers in line. This was extremely unprofessional. Dear employee of simple pleasures, your job is a joke and if you can't handle DOING YOUR JOB, then your boss should find someone who can."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This is a great spot to hang out or get some work done, and there's always a good mix of people doing both. They have music and beer specials on Wednesdays, and the service is friendly. Also, you've got a view of the ocean when you hang on the parklet outside."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Been visiting since 2003. Great neighborhood establishment. Will be here long after you've moved out of SF. If you're looking for a venti something though, there's a Starbucks down in the Wells Fargo at 19th Ave."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"I love this coffee shop, chill laid back coffee with affordable bagel sandwiches.  The only draw back is this incrediblely terrible barista whose lattes are almost as bad as her attitude. She so obviously hates her job she is uncomfortable to be around, let alone order a drink from..."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"At the time, definitely the local hang out.  A great selection of things to eat a light to a full breakfast, lunch or dinner.  They have sandwiches, soups, ready-made burritos, Jalapeño cheese rolls, Croissants, pastries, croissant bagels, cookies, brownies etc.  The selection of draft beers covers the bases. Pale Ale, Stout, Sour, and more."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"At it's best, SImple Pleasures is an unassuming cafe with a mostly relaxed atmosphere with a nice staff. The hot beverages are pretty good and the food isn't bad (I've had some yummy soup here). What I dislike about it is:  1) Generic, mediocre baked goods (think stale cookies with old M&Ms stuck in them)... in a place like SF, that just isn't acceptable. :(  2) Obnoxious live music which pretty much kills whatever there is to like at that cafe and makes it... ugh, awful. Why do the owners of cafes think having some dude playing 70s tunes on a guitar brings in business? When I see it I leave. Owners of Simple Pleasures... usually I go to your place to relax and read, maybe to talk to a friend, not have some person screaming at the top of their lungs or making it so there's no place in your establishment where I can escape the sucky sounds. Just speaking for myself, I tend to go here less because I've just seen too much terrible ""music"" pervading this place. We need more and better cafes on the western side of the city!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Coffee is solid and it’s a neighborhood institution. Great spot.  Only 4 stars because they are stingy with cream cheese on bagels.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Great cafe place to hang out and read or chill. It is a fairly quiet environment with people working and studying so loud groups may not be the best idea. Best cafe I've been to yet
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Awesome coffee shop with good eats, modest selection of alcohol and regular live music! The little parklet right outside is an extra bonus that adds to this place's charm."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Simple Pleasures is something of an institution and it attracts what appears to be an older, whiter, ex hippie clientele compared to La Promenade, a block down the street. It has a nice Parklet curbside which makes it a favorite hangout for locals."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Neighborhood vibe, always the perfectly curated soundtrack (thanks staff!), and lots of dog-friendly outside seats to enjoy on a nice day. 90's character and perfectly roasted caffeine. 😚 …"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"This is a good spot to hang out and read. Haven't sampled much in the way of pastries but I can say I tried a dirty chai and won't be ordering another one. Great patio though, maybe good for some tea on a lazy sunday afternoon."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"it's here, it's got a community, a wonderful parklet out front, but terrible coffee. yeeessshhhhh.  12/17/18: it just keeps getting worse. the counter staff gave me attitude when I asked for the cream cheese that should've come with my bagel and lox. you know, as posted on the menu."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Great bagels and coffee!! They have a couple of breakfast options too, not just a coffee place. Can get crowded, so time it around rush hours if you want to avoid a line."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Really enjoy this place. Nice cafe to relax in; plus there are events here sometimes. The artwork and vibe just complete the experience for sure.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Full plate of fresh veggies, egg salad & a bagel under $5! Or a large bowl of fresh melons & fruit, yogurt & granola under $5. Delicious! Killer good coffee too!!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Cheap beer and great atmosphere. Great neighborhood joint to read or hang out. It is hard to find a good cafe to study at in the outer richmond but this one is good.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Avoid. Dirty. Noisy. Unfriendly.  Not sure how you removed my comment about the service personnel telling me that this ain't starbucks yuppie when I simply asked for no room in my coffee as I drink it black.   Yes I got a cup only half full.  Coffee stains on the wall.  Crumbs all over the floor .  Stains on furniture and rugs.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Great coffee roasted just a couple doors away. Delicious baked goods.  Soup. Sandwiches.  Priced very reasonably.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Christy is the bomb. Works Fri, Sat pretty reliabily. Trust no other latte than Christy's. She makes the best coffee in the area!"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Cozy local spot. Friendly staff. No complaints, I come here daily and love it."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"After being a customer since 96, this is still one of my favorites.   Very local clientele.   I love the bagel with cream cheese and tomatoes."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"A warm, friendly coffee shop/cafe where dogs are allowed! 10 stars in my book Parklet for warm sunny days outside seating"
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Good coffee, bagels and other baked goods. I did not try a sandwich. Great vibe even just waiting for take out."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"They actually open at 6am on a Sunday! Amazing! Lifesaver for a jet lagged traveller. And the smiles, awesome bagel and coffee. Thank you. Perfect."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Yummy mocha. Solid espresso drinks. Affordable and equally yummy pastries with live performance. Cute quaint and organic!

Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,Neighborhood spot ... No corporate BS here!!! Staff seems genuinely pleasant and happy to be here.  Welcoming baristas that aren't too cool or snooty.
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"That guy Ryan behind the bar is really cute and charming, I'm definitely coming back. Oh yeah and the drinks and food are good too..."
Simple Pleasures Cafe,3434 Balboa St,"Awesome local cafe. Great reasonable priced drinks and pastries, and free wifi!"
