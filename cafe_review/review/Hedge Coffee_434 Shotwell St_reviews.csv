Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"it’s not hedge anymore, it’s called FRONT. they used to be in mission bay and now they’re here. we had matcha lattes which were really cute with latte art. $12 for two lattes before tip is a lot, but i get it, we live in a crazy city."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Coffee and service were great! The baristas were so nice and were patient with our guests, despite the amount of orders they received. Looking forward to working with them again!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"They have the best beans!! The staff is super friendly and drinks are made with care (so if there are people in front of you it may take some time, but it is well worth it!!). I get the single origin latte and can actually taste the flavors. We also use their beans at home in our Breville espresso maker and are amazed at how good it tastes."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,Perfect. Smiling and expertise is always something you miss when you go for a coffee. In my case Turmeric Chai was awesome.
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"It is always a delight to have Hedge Coffee come to the office. We have a large team (~150) and they are so patient and kind to everyone. The coffee and tea is amazing, such a treat!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,By far the best coffee in San Francisco. Had a cappuccino with regular milk and another with oat milk from a kiosk they set up at an event I attended at Fort Mason. Cool staff. Way to go and the best of luck guys!
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Always a great way to start the morning when Hedge is at the office.  Excellent service, very friendly folks, and wonderful Cappuccinos.  Highly recommended!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Hedge Coffee is amazing! I've had their Mocha and Latte and have been so impressed with the artisanship that goes into their drinks. I'm a School Social Worker for San Francisco and reached out to them to ask about a potential donation for our hard working (but stressed out) teachers. They JUMPED at the chance, even with their super busy schedule, and came out a few weeks later to spend the entire morning making amazing drinks for our staff. Our teachers were blown away with the love and kindness that they showed us. THANK you Hedge Coffee for top notch coffee and for caring for your local community!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,Love their cortado and friendly faces!  Perfect way to start the day!!!
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Hedge is by FAR my favorite coffee shop in the world. Yes, I've said it and I'm not exaggerating. The coffee itself is fantastic, but what really makes this place special is the people who run it. Kyle is the friendliest and most welcoming barista I've had the chance to encounter; his positive energy alone is so contagious and makes going to Hedge more like a self-care moment than just a coffee run. Service is fantastic, the food is incredible (the bagel lox.. kimchi croissant.. just wow) and the people who get their coffee here also often seem like really interesting characters from all walks of life. If you love people-watching, exquisite coffee, human connection, amazing unique food and flavors, and neighborhood communities... Hedge is THAT place."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Excellent coffee experience with a catered coffee cafe service, Hedge Coffee will transform your office event into a destination spot for the entire staff! From the attention to detail with every handmade order, to the helpful, patient, and professional baristas, Hedge Coffee is the easy choice for your next coffee caterer. A easy 5 star experience and the highest recommendation available earned by these mobile coffee trailblazers."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Great cortado (oat milk for me) and really friendly conversation. Update: just had the mocha, which I'm not usually into, but it was a complex, bittersweet revelation."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"A client booked Hedge Coffee to serve at a wedding we hosted at our venue. As GM of the facility, I have worked with all kinds of different vendors and event providers over the years.  Hedge Coffee were on time, easy to work with, polite, careful about their impact on the facility, followed directions, and produced amazing coffee drinks for our guests. I would highly recommend them if you need a coffee cart."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"A small coffee shop with superb coffee. Their espresso is awesome, and we got a bag of their beans for brewing at home - so good!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Friendly staff, amazing coffee. I even tried their turmeric chai latte and it was amazing. Not too sweet and nicely spiced. Hope they will come to the office more often!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,You gotta come here! The staff is awesome and the coffee so good. Thanks for brightening my day 🥰 …
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Super friendly and knowledgeable about the coffee, and willing to give an in depth explanation. And they sell Neighbor Bakehouse goods 🥐🤤 …"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"What a gem! ✨ I’ve tried your cappuccino a few times and it was always meticulously perfect. Thank you for consistency, professionalism, charm and soul in each cup you brew. You are a wonder of SF. Wish you to win hearts of the whole world!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"A very friendly neighborhood coffee pop-up. Great choice of not usual savory pastries (mushroom or kimchi!) and lavender latte (not a syrup option, but real seeds). Amazing customer service. Nice sunlit sitting area."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"I am all about Food & Beverage, have been for 40 years and coffee is a favorite!  I do many many many ""special events/catering gigs"" all over the Bay Area.  I have worked with a few mobile coffee carts and have one of my own that I break out for special occasions, so when I tell you that Olga & Alex are truly ""The S%*T"" when it comes to great coffee and service it is truly saying something.  I worked with them twice this week for the first time taking care of 300+ guests in two very different spots in different counties and these two are professional and sweethearts.  They are exactly what you want if you want to truly WOW your guests with coffee and espresso drinks!  I enjoyed both brewed coffee and several cappuccinos from them and my kitchen folks did as well and we all were more than happy since it is rare to ever get offered such beverages let alone such great ones.  Try them, you will Love them ;~>"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"Hedge has opened a pop-up cafe along Alabama Street. Espresso drinks, batch brew coffee, pastries, cookies and more. Additional food items such as toast are available on the weekend. Sit and enjoy your drink in the sun at one of three picnic tables or wood blocks placed in the building’s loading area.  The roaster from Front Coffee is visible behind the coffee preparation area. Hedge has started selling their own beans roasted in collaboration with Front. There is usually one espresso and two pour over roast levels for sale."
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,I’ve driven down multiple times from Sac for Hedge - obsessed!
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"They definitely wow'd me with the cortado they made for me. Hedge came out to an event our company hosts. We have barista at the company so I wasn't gonna wait in line for a cup of coffee, but something caught my attention when I walked by. Someone was making something with their hearts...Olga & Alex (I believe, from another review) were standing in front of their espresso machine carefully making each cup of coffee for the guests. They were not rushing, not cutting corner, and not trying to be fancy. They were just 100% making coffee. I don't know how to describe it in word you have to see it to appreciate it. I thought ok I'm gonna try one cup to see what this is about. I found out when I got my cup of cortado. It has the best microfoam I've ever seen, and it tastes better than any espresso product I've ever had. It's beyond coffee! It reminded me what coffee is about, after years of just getting cappuccino from where ever (I used to make them myself). It was a great experience!"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,"I had a nitro cold brew: typically not my preferred cup of joe. I was glad I deviated from my norm.  The huge cube of ice was visually appealing signature for this strong,  bold yet not overly bitter cup of coffee"
Hedge Coffee,434 Shotwell St,Hedge Coffee sets the bar high when it comes to exceptional coffee and service. Our team at Ain't Normal Café has been lucky enough to learn from and work with Alex and Olga. Thank you Hedge!

Not only is the coffee excellent, but Olga, Alex, and the entire team are a delight to work with — super punctual, warm, and with a beautiful coffee pop-up display to boot. I've had Hedge Coffee at other events, too — can't recommend them enough."
