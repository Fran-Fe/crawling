Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I’ve been to a few Ritual Coffee locations and this one is by far my favorite. This location has a very calm, and fun interior, with lots of plants. The seating is spaced out in a way that doesn’t make it feel crowded.  I got the seasonal drink which was some sort of pineapple tonic espresso and it was outstanding. Definitely the best of the seasonal options I have tried. Service was good, overall this was a very fun and unique experience and I look forward to coming back!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"A charming location with a staff that not only takes craft coffee seriously, they have the skill to back it up.  Great raw materials coupled with proper shots, artfully crafted beverages and even their tea steeping method is innovative and superior.  Definitely worth returning."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Ritual is hands down one of my favorite coffee spots in the bay. Their coffee is always phenomenal. The cafe is a pleasant spot with natural light and a lot of seating. They've got a good amount of merch available for purchase as well. Check this place out!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I love Ritual, it is my coffee of choice in San Francisco and the environment is super contemporary and dead stylish. AND no matter which Ritual you go to, the quality is consistent."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Pretty cozy cafe, with friendly staff! Oat milk latte was on point! I would definitely want to try their dandelion mokha next time."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Tasty single-origin coffee in the Mission district! A good range of brewing methods (V60, Syphon, Espresso) and really helpful, friendly service."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great neighborhood coffee shop close to Valencia St in the Mission. Their vegan donuts are tasty and their drinks aren’t too sweet. Service is friendly and quick, even with the morning rush."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"They have some good coffee. There are a lot of space here, people here are trendy."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,The missus and I came for a cuppa due to the high reviews. Not too sure what went wrong but the coffee was sour and the mocha special tasted burnt. It’s a great place to chill but the pastry selection is limited and our one and only coffee experience hasn’t been great. We’ll give this place a miss in the future.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The coffee was actually good so if your looking for a place to just get a cup and go you should come here. However how in the world are you going to call yourself a coffee shop in the heart of the Bay Area (San Francisco) and not have wifi.  I mean come on I was charged 8 dollars plus tip for a cup of coffee, please get some wifi."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Good coffee. I like their beans. Prices for beans are typical for SF which is expensive, but quality is good. Indoor seating strikes careful balance between elegance and comfort"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Ok coffee shop.  Clean with lots of funky seating.  Kind of sterile feeling.  Server/barista was indifferent. Not rude, but not welcoming either.  Coffee was good and hot, not ultra memorable.  But had the caffeine I craved!  It was very quiet and I made a work call from there.(early morning)  Just a coffee shop .. but clean with hot java"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great place for a coffee.  We were walking around this area and always have to stop here when we're nearby.  During the pandemic, they kept people outside by the benches but now they are open again. It is advised to wear a mask when you enter and order, but you can sit inside. It's a spacious indoor area.  We got the dandelion mocha."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Nice spot for a coffee and pastry! I had a vegan donut (plain with sprinkles) and the scone of the day. Both very good! My friend got the croissant and a cappuccino. We sat outside and enjoyed the fairly warm SF Sunday morning.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Its a nice shop. Lots of space. They sell accessories and bags of coffee also. I got a couple oatmilk latte in a can tht had calories on the side with other nutrition info. Nice 😀 fresh brewed coffee and coffee drinks too. LOVED tht latte!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,This place has the highest quality coffee in the city. Comparable to Heart in Portland. I stop by whenever I am in the mission. It has a menu of coffee you can choose from and a super cool vibe inside with interest art. Highly recommend.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"coffee was pretty good but tbh, we’re fortunate that most of the cafes in the city have great espresso drinks. nothing to complain about but they are under construction so there was no indoor seating"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,This is a definite must go place for me when I'm in SF. Great coffee and atmosphere. Love it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee and service but more than anything, love that there’s always a space to sit when other coffee shops down the street are always unpredictable."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I ordered my usual cortado and it was delicious! The espresso was smooth and bright.  This is a bustling hip cafe. If you need to camp out to recharge your phone or other device they do have one plug in spot!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,They served me a great latte and it’s nearby many great brunch places. Only small downside is there’s no Wi-Fi here so not an ideal work/study spot.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"There's something about Ritual coffee! To this day, it is the best coffee I've had, and I've been drinking coffee from cafés for 30 years. Yes, I know, I could have invested all that money and opened my own cafe by now, but someone needs to keep the economy going."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Nice spot to sit and enjoy your coffee. No WiFi or power outlets so you can’t stay forever to work :p  Coffee is great and the staff are always friendly.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Awesome latte art, cool interior design. Coffee taste was okay but not spectacular. Clean place but awful music taste, loud at times. Last but not least which respactable coffee place does not have WiFi access?"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great design, coffee and presentation. Staff at register barely responds to you and mine actually yawned while I ordered. Zero response from my Barista after saying thank you for my latte. During my 5 minutes of interaction with the staff, all I’m sensing is pretentiousness which suits the tech bros filling this place. No WiFi. You can smell the bathroom from the seat nearby. Music is too loud to sit and read so I guess they want you to drink your coffee and leave ASAP. Must be a short term money focused business."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,It’s possible to sit and work. They collab with a vegan bakery for donuts. Whack donuts. Will definitely try. They were sold out when I arrived ~2pm.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I can't tell that I like it because my experience wasn't so pleasant. The macchiato was so regular. The barista wasn't really friendly when I asked to use the corde to charge my phone. It's good to sit here with your laptop here and have a coffee for a long time or get the coffee for to go. I like coffeeshops that are cozy and warm and this one isn't one of them
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"My favorite coffee spot on Valencia Street. Been going here every day for 14 years. The baristas are super well trained, their sourcing and roasting is the best, and every cup is crafted with love. Ritual is the best!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Lots of hype, tough to deliver. They have very good coffee, but it's not the best. The wait can be long, and the brew process feels like a production assembly line. Overall I like the place but it's more hype than deserved."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Modern, friendly, great coffee. Rotating single origins and blends. Coffee 5. Atmosphere 4. Service 5. No wifi."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Best people and best coffee! Stay true as you are :)
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I live 15 steps from the one in Valencia, and I was so happy to have a coffee shop close to my new place when I moved to Mission. However, for all the unpleasant experiences I have had so far, I will have to drink instant coffee for now. The croissant costs $5, and you don’t even have the option to warm it up. Two times I went to get my croissant and coffee, they gave me a burned croissant. I mentioned that I would like my croissant a little lighter, and guess what? The servers didn’t take that well, questioning why I wanted a “lighter” croissant and not a roasted one, saying that they had never heard about that before. Seriously?! I am paying for a $5 cold croissant, and I cannot even choose how cooked I want my croissant to be."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Good coffee, but too noisy music There's no Wifi I had Latte wirh almond milk, tastes good"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Really spiritual and has great concept about how they do things. Not to mention about their splendid single orogin coffee!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Really rude staff! No toilet, no even try your, no coffee inside. Place under refurbishment. They just want to make money. You take your coffee and then get out in the rain in a really rude manner!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Coffee is ok. Has a specific floral flavor to the coffee, which is a bean flavor I’m not partial to. Overall, its a modern styled building which is another thing that I don’t particularly enjoy.  If you like modern decor styled and floral flavor notes in your coffee, this is the place for you."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Obsessed with Ritual coffee. I get our whole beans for home and stop in regular for their iced coffee. I believe they have the best beans in SF — and I drink a lot of coffee here.  Also their decaf pour over is the greatest thing that’s ever happened for pregnant people and people who can’t tolerate caffeine.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Very nice place with a real hipster atmosphere. Coffee was great, I went for their specialty ""The Nibble""."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"My pour over was ready in a couple of minutes and there were a few seats left to nab. The beans were great, smooth cup with a good balance of flavor. The music was a bit loud but that could just be me."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee and love the space for chilling, reading a book, or working. Always busy and lively, but expect a small line on weekends."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"What kind of coffee shop doesn’t have wifi these days? Just hipster, not practical."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Really great coffee and helpful staff. The vibe inside is relaxing with lots of beautiful art for sale on the walls. Outdoor seating is available as well but directly in the sun.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"If coffee is your ritual, this is THE place for you. Great service, nice atmosphere. Enough space for a big group of people."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Hip spot. Maybe not the best cappuccino I’ve ever had, but this is my second visit. Would visit again the next time I’m in the Mission."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Amazing coffee, expert roasting, preparation, and customer service. Thanks for making me an off-menu 1&1!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,VERY PROUD TO GIVE A 5 ⭐️ BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER DRINK COFFEE IN A PLACE I NEVER TRIED BEFORE BUT MY FRIEND BROUGHT ME HERE FOR A QUICK SNACK AND AM SO IMPRESSED
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Amazing single origin light roast pour overs + great vibes. If you like fruity light roast coffees, this is your place!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Don’t order online. They’ll pretend your order doesn’t exist. Waited over 25 minutes for a cappuccino and croissant. New customers came in, placed new orders, and left while I still waited."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"They should make it clear that there’s no WiFi. The beans are good and the space would be a nice place to work if it had WiFi, but it doesn’t and I am annoyed that I wasted the time coming here."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Perfect amount of foam and served at the perfect temperature. One of the best coffee spots in San Francisco!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"We visited this place on a off chance as some local friends took us there.. locals suggest it is a good place to visit but I have to explain our experience on that day.. they have an obsession with wearing a mask, yes they are the rules but to pay with Apple Pay you have to pull it off to authorise it and the moment I pulled my mask off for literally one second they told me off.. now you explain to me how that is reasonable. Secondly a friend pull the mask down ti quickly have a sip and again a lady came all the way from the counter to tell him to put the mask back, and she did it in such a rude way I could not believe it.. staff is very rude, the place was under refurbishment very messy and I wondered whether they could actually keep it open. To conclude it, if you are thinking of going there don’t waste your time, there are many places in San Francisco where you can enjoy your time and taste a proper coffee, you don’t need Ritual."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Solid 3rd wave coffee, barista intentional and focused, medium light roast, very good milk texturing, airy space. Would like to have seen bean options from Ethiopia for purchase"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"They just couldn't be any ruder and arrogant about it as a whole, I mean come on, if you are that unhappy, find other employment.  This coffee shop is a total buzz kill, go else where, I know I've bought my last $7 coffee here and thank the lord I didn't leave a tip. Nothing worse in the service industry then having to tip BEFORE, you receive your service, feels like I'm spinning the roulette wheel everytime these days."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Excellent espresso. Great vegan pastries, cool vibes and outdoor seating"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"They have decent coffee, but no WiFi. The interior decor is good."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This is a very nice place to spend an hour on a coffee break. They have the kinds of coffees that would really satisfy your taste. The crew was really smiley, welcoming, and clearly very proud of the quality of their coffees and service. The place does get crowded as it’s fairly small, but it’s definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Excellent coffee, but NO wifi."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"My favorite coffee in San Francisco. Heck, my favorite coffee anywhere. Great coffee, welcoming atmosphere, a real local treasure."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"If this is your seating in March 2022, you’re not open for dine in…taking my business elsewhere."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,No wifi! Thought I'd come to have a coffee and work.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,One of my favorite specialty coffee shops in SF. The beans for purchase are always fresh (within a couple days off roast) and the drinks are on point. Big fan of the decor at this location too.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"My favorite coffee shop in the area, they serve up some delicious beans! You can taste the quality of everything that goes into it. They’re also one of very few places that uses organic milk.  Lines can get long sometimes, but they do a great job of moving things along, so I never feel like the wait is excessive. Always worth the wait."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. The location, space, and quality of coffee are all reasons to keep going back. I'm an iced coffee fan and their cold brew is one of my favorites- just the right amount of acid and fruit notes. The natural light is great and comes in from both the front and the back, which you can't say for a lot of places in the city! They do a revolving art installation in partnership with local artists, which is always nice to check out. Great spot to sit and work or for a meet up with a friend."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"09/08/20 Update: I am excited to change my previous 3-star rating to 5 stars!  Very inconsistent experience with those coffee shops. The one we had coffee at yesterday (Octavia st.) was smooth and mellow, whereas today’s experience at this location is rather poor - bitter tasting, lukewarm cappuccino. Hate it when you expect a high-quality product from the place that sets this standard to themselves, and then end up having something average."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"One of the places I got to regularly. Coffee is always good, plenty of seating (although it can get hard to find seating during peak hours). There is also outdoor seating on Valencia Street. I always go for on of their espressos and I have not been disappointed!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,The best coffee shop in San Francisco ❤️
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This place is a little busy,  they have indoor seating with some benches outside.  Chai latte  was pretty good. I'd give it 4 stars."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Sadly, the coffee here is decent, but it’s consistently served with attitude.  On my recent, and now last, visit, three separate employees made the experience disappointing at best and downright unwelcoming at worst. No smiles.  No hellos.  No “may I help you?” Instead, while the only customer at the counter, it was as if I was interrupting someone when I asked for a beverage from the woman behind the register, or, later, when there was no creamer, the woman at the barista station standing around. The final straw was the fellow sweeping the floor who essentially followed me around as if I were Charles Schultz’s Pigpen character. The place is large; he could have been anywhere else in the store.  I don’t expect someone to cater to my every whim, but for $9.75, including my tip, I’ve come to appreciate that a happy work environment extends to generating happy customers that WANT to return.  I can’t speak to the feelings of these employees. I can only speak to their demonstrative behavior.  I can think of any number of other coffee house retailers that understand this relationship and strive to be positively engaged.  I’m going to go to those from now on."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great, laid back environment. Plenty of seating."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"My chai latte in a ceramic cup was good , nice pleasant atmosphere"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Ritual Coffee Roasters was the first coffee cafe I have been to in San Francisco. The moment you walk in, you are surrounded by the smell of freshly made coffee and warmly greeted by the workers. Though there was a long line, they got to me quite fast. I had no idea what to order and the cash register kindly recommended me to their ice coffee. That was a really good choice and was coffee that I have never tasted before. It was refreshing. I stayed there for an hour or two and was a very pleasant experience. I would definitely recommend this cute cafe if anyone wants some coffee!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I had the Costa Rican 'El Angel' pour over. What an interesting, and fantastic, cup. Without the description I would still have picked up the roasted almond and molasses hints. But, I don't think I would have been able to name the light aftertaste as 'Coke'. A delightful afternoon cup! The folks there were very nice. As a bonus, I'll credit them for arranging the multitude of dogs that descended upon me for playtime while I waited for my cup."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Don’t bother if you want espresso. Their pourover is okay but the espresso is mediocre at best, and generally inconsistent because the espresso machines aren’t well maintained."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Literally my favorite coffee in the world from a team that really cares. They love their coffee and have the education to reach out all about its complexities a how they carefully selected the blend. The staff are all great people, the cafes have a fun vibe and if you're just passing through, this is one of the must see SF stops!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,It takes a while but worth it! Coffee is excellent. Wish the pastry case could be more extensive! But that isn't stopping me from coming.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Found out about this amazing coffee roasters from a barista in my hometown of Boise, Idaho and I love trying coffee from unique places. I've been to San Fran many times, but have not had the pleasure of checking out Ritual in person (yet). During this lockdown period where we don't get to go out much so it is fun to be able to order something new and exciting. I ordered their single origin coffee ""Ace"" which is made for use in espresso machines. The coffee absolutely knocked my socks off!!! They did a great job of shipping it quickly and they send you the freshest roast when you order on their website. Can't wait to visit one of their spots in San Fran next time I am in town...Cheers!!!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"As a fan of the traditional Italian cappuccino, the one here didn't impress me. However, the cafe is huge with lots of space which seemed nice for a working session (they've got communal tables as well as individual ones). I just loved the outside seats here!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I love that there are so many small coffee houses that you can come to here in San Francisco. Ritual is one of my favorites! Their pour over coffee is fantastic and I like how they bring out the depth of flavor from the beans in their different types of roasts. I tried their mocha today and it was knock your socks off delicious! The velvety chocolate was sweetened only by the richness of the milk and the espresso brought this bouquet of flavors together and made it perfection! Inside this is a busy little cafe. When I went there was a line out the door for service but the line moved very quickly so don't let that deter you from enjoying one of their magnificent cups of java!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I've tried their house coffee (black is my preference) and love their options. I live closer to this location, but found out about Ritual Coffee Roasters from the location in Hayes Valley. This location definitely gets busy and I've waited for quite some time, but I believe its worth the wait. There is really no way to make their process faster in my opinion. Great service all around and there is lots of seating to just chill."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Friendly staff. Excellent dark roast house coffee. Great selection of pre-made lunch meals and delicious artisan sandwiches made fresh. Great service and the staff remembers your orders. They also have a tasty selection of craft beers that will hit the spot during that quick lunch run.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Dear Ritual, your coffee is amazing. But what I want to tell you is how much you staying open and your service during the COVID-19 is appreciated. You totally won my heart! Yesterday, I visited your storefront for a bag of espresso beans, and your upbeat staff made my day."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Coffee is good but 1 star for NO PUBLIC WIFI. How does a coffee shop not have wifi?
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee and service! I spent an afternoon here working with my laptop and had a good time. Luckily I have a good data plan on my phone as there is no wifi here (and kinda liked it as it does not get as crowded on the tables). Just get more sockets out, there is only one available.."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Get off the Bart at 16th and Valencia and get ready to have a delightful coffee at Ritual. The decor is awesome and really does set the mood and ambiance. The coffee takes me back to an unknown place and definitely not San Francisco. The service is good, but can  be slow because they take pride in their work."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I typically love Ritual, but there's a couple things that knock this down to a 4-star establishment instead of a 5-star. First off, I do appreciate how clean and simply decorated/open this coffee shop is. It feels airy and not stuffy/cramped like a lot of coffee shops do. The people behind the register are typically incredibly friendly (s/o to Kendall). I came this morning around 8:30am and they were out of chocolate for the dandelion chocolate mocha (which is essentially the only reason I come here). They also have very limited seating (it's usually taken) and no WiFi. Parking can be pretty tough, and the outdoor seating area is also very limited. So, I usually come here before work and get my coffee to go before making the 1.5 hour commute down to San Jose.  If you like dependably good quality coffee and just want it to go (you don't need a place to sit down in work) or you loveeee mocha's, I'd recommend this place."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,My favorite cafe for more than a decade.  Consistently well trained baristas that make me  delicious espresso drink or two every single day..
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Okay so if you are in the mission and want to grab a coffee someplace new.. this place is the one! Ive been here zillion times and I still love the coffee here. I would personally recommend you to try the cappucino or the hot chocolate! They are always full and lively and the ambience is great. Perfect place to hang out with a friend or a group or just you and your laptop!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"An instance of when artisanal translates into a $7 cup of tea or a $5 cup of coffee. Not saying they make bad coffee, but I am saying that they fall into that category of SF coffee spots that gouge customers simply because they can. That, and because the new lease they signed for their sweet, sweet Valencia location is expeeeeensive. I guess that’s the cost of gentrification?"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Good coffee. No WiFi. Barista was nice. But cashier seem to be tired which is normal so early in the morning. Good space to still bring in your laptop if you have hotspot. Space outside to sit down and enjoy the sun and people watch.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Ritual is one of the best coffee shops in the city! Each cup of coffee is carefully prepared, and the place is always packed, specially on weekends, which could diminish the experience. I only wish they had better pastries, and this could be my favorite coffee shop in the world."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Best coffee in San Francisco. I've had Cappucino's from the best places in New York these guys have the Right stuff! In a class of their own. I purchased beans and ordered more once I got back to New York.   Staff is amazing and friendly.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,We were on our way to Griffith Park and we wanted a caffeine boost. I yelped organic coffee and this was the closest place. And WOW how thankful were we to have the opportunity to try this place. They have a great ceremonial grade matcha that was out of this world. I got it with a double shot of espresso and I was feeling myself. Sooo great!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Walking into the Ritual Coffee is like experiencing an old-age style coffeehouse with a flair of modernization. The array of coffee selection hot or cold is outstanding and the service was served with efficiency and a smile. There is a reason why the place is always packed weekends and weekdays. Tables are always filled with people sitting down with their laptops for endless hours. For any person looking to experience coffee in an old-age style area with a vibrant young crowd, I highly recommend this place."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This one of the most frequented cafes in SF, and it's easy to see why. The coffee is great, any of the espresso drinks and drip coffee are well-made. Though there's always a line, the cafe has a great ambiance, is relatively large with a lot of seating, and features free wifi, great for hanging out with a group or just working!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Bright, sharp and loud. Not my kind of coffee shop. I got a strange feeling in my stomach when I walked in here and the staff are less than friendly towards someone who doesn't wear the hipster uniform properly. Which is unfortunate because their coffee is pretty good. No wifi and not comfortable at all for meetings or work."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Do you want a robust cup of coffee served to you by some cute hipsters? This is the place to go. Line is always out the door in the morning but worth it. Plenty of space inside and a good atmosphere to work on your laptop in. Also, gotta love the branding of this place, it definitely makes Starbucks look like the super sell-out older cousin, Ritual being the obviously much cooler of the two."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee, and if you enjoy minimalist interior design and architecture, you'd appreciate this place. There is no wifi but this is welcoming for anyone who wants to chill without being surrounded by a sea of people working on their laptops. What disappoints is the staff, who are unfriendly (or gave that impression on this occasion). This translates to the service and the pretentious hipster vibe Ritual Coffee Roasters strives to be."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I'll be the one who doesn't review coffee... I had chai and hot chocolate here and they were both bland and too sweet.. I had a sweet snack - which was definitely not memorable because I cannot remember what it was...the seating area is nice and the service quite friendly. I never waited in line for longer than 5 minutes. I am not a coffee drinker so bare that in mind... but I do think that Ritual should raise the bar on other items on the menu and not only focus on coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Underwhelming. The space is really nice, although strangely laid out, but the coffee left a lot to be desired. The nitro cold brew was over priced and over extracted, didn't have that silky smooth taste that I've come to expect from good nitro. Didn't try any espresso drinks as I wanted to explore other coffee in the area and didn't want to risk it after the disappointment of the cold brew. Chances are if you're messing that up, your espresso probably isn't going to be on point."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Very good coffee. No wifi here, but the music is also too loud to read or do any kind of focused work. They're clearly optimizing for people not spending very much time in the shop, which is a good way to make money, but also means I won't be coming back 🤷🏽‍♂️ …"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This place has some pretty amazing coffee.  I like order the sweet tooth drip and a pastry of sorts.  This is also a great place to cowork as they have quite a bit of seating and free wifi.  Be warned though -- outlets at tables are limited, but there are a couple of communal tables in the back with outlet strips."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Good espresso drinks with below-average service.  Perhaps it's a function of the quantity of patrons that they need to serve, but on two occasions, the staff have been unnecessarily glib/terse.  As others have noted, you'll have to wait a while for your drink."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The espresso here is on the dark side, I'd daresay even a bit burnt.  The Americanos we ordered were fine, but not terrific. The space is pretty, but there are a ton of people looking for a chair- not the long bar without stools - and they could fit more seating without really compromising the modernity of it.  People would wander, hunting for a seat and leave.  That's the kind of stereotypical modern design that people lampoon, and it doesn't have to be that way. The other downside here was one of the bathrooms was out of order - of 2.  Considering the amount of people in here, one bathroom is simply inadequate."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Unfortunately very rude staff. I really enjoyed the coffee, but the attitudes really weren’t a great start to my day. Wish the staff could spread a little more kindness."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Cappuccino is $3.50 for an 8 oz cup. It's not overly bitter. Mild I would say. So, I'll call it an average cup.  The coffee shop is more spacious in the front of the store with more seating in the rear with a few double tables and a long community table."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Too loud and the dandelion mocha wasn't very chocolatey or sweet. Mostly bitter coffee flavor, almost burnt. Not for lightweights like me. Lots of vegan options though which is awesome!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"If only they did some decent espresso. They have the coffee, they have the machines, the grinders and everything except what matters...baristas and a espresso attitude. Had flat white that was decent however, as said, I would have loved a proper espresso.  Might come back again."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Literally cannot go wrong going to any of the Ritual locations. One of the only places I always make sure I visit whenever I am here. I love the Proxy Square location, as well as this one on Valencia st. Going to be tough to beat their quality anywhere, let alone across SF."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This is a good place to grab a coffee socially, but not to work. The staff and layout of the space make it very clear laptops are not welcome. There is no wifi and a single electrical outlet in the entire shop... and there are outlets that have been purposely closed. In a packed city like San Francisco, this is a serious let-down."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Excellent espresso-and-milk drinks. Hip place to work or meet with friends if its not too busy. Friendly service, consistently excellent baristas. It can be a bit dark and cold inside, but still highly recommended."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Ritual Coffee Roasters is one of my favorite coffee shops to visit in the city. Their decorative shop brings about a great experience for any coffee lover. The only con about this place is that it might take a while to get your coffee because there's just so many people. Plan to beat the crowd!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This is about coffee only: every time I give Ritual coffee a chance, I regret it.  I've tried their drip coffee and ""borrowed"" my roommate's Ritual beans to make my own at home. Every time, the flavor is just weird to me. I know many people love it, but I find it to be too pungent and syrupy.  Feel free to try your luck here, the facilities are clean and they just did a remodel so that's exciting. I just don't think I'm willing to try again."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Decent drinks but this is definitely a drink your drink and gtfo place. No electrical outlets or WiFi, which is a little frustrating as cafes are where I work while mainlining caffeine. But the noise level is actually pretty good for an uber trendy place (usually trendy open spaces have deafening echos) and there’s plenty of seating for a conversation with, I don’t know.... a human? But if you like a cafe to work in this is decent so long as you bring your electronics charged up and something for WiFi."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Overpriced coffee, not a lot solo seating, and no wifi. Maybe its just me, but whats the point of a coffeeshop if not to get a cup of coffee and some snacks and sit and do computer stuff? I gave it three stars because it's nice decor and there's a few cute guys working."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I like everything but the wait line and the fact that you have to watch for seating like a hawk (and swoop on it in a similar fashion). The coffee never disappoints, and I love that I can ask any barista about the espresso and they're knowledgeable about their products."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Fantastic coffee, lovely space, electrical outlets."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Got a latte to go from this place. The microfoam and latte art were done to perfection, but the coffee was not warm enough for my taste. Still, would give them another try. The place itself is quite vibrant, with a very modern decor."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Arrogant, have their own rules (not city rules) on COVID.  If I want to have a coffee, I want to feel welcome and be greeted with a smile"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I've always committed ritualistic act at Ritual by worshipping the very slow dripped medium roast coffee with a holy bible slurping and humming like a happy angry glowing eyes cat from the basement. I just love it. Good place to surf the net and ignore everybody else including your date. But I suppose your date is under mind control from you after you drank their powerfully smooth coffee so it's no biggie.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,This was my cortado from today. Was also supposed to be a double but was only a single. Seems like Ritual is not as good as it used to be.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"My favorite coffee place in the Mission. Coffee is taken seriously here and I value that highly. If you're looking for food, go elsewhere, unless it's for snacks with your coffee.  Workers are friendly, the music is solid and the patrons widely vary. Ritual is a must for this longtime Mission resident and coffee maven."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This place had literally the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The guys behind the counter asked us what they could get for us while we were looking at the menu, and then when we told them said that we were in the wrong spot for ordering- and acted like we were yelling our order at them. Then, my husband's americano tasted really strange- like an extremely thick and oily texture. He drinks americanos everyday, two times a day, and said that this was the worst americano he had ever had. I went to the counter to let them know it tasted strange and asked for a new one, and the guy asked me what was wrong with it (which is fine) but when I told him, had the worst attitude and said that that coffee naturally has oils (duh) and that it was supposed to taste like that. He literally acted like I had no idea what I was talking about and had never had espresso before. He reluctantly said they would try again but that he didn't know how they could do anything differently. My husband tried the new one and it tasted terrible as well. It was so bad that he went up to the counter and just left the whole thing there untouched- even though he had paid for it. Worst customer service and not even a good product. Would NEVER recommend this place."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This place has become an institution for a place to meet up with friends and chat over coffee in the Mission.  Of their coffee beans, my favorite is the Sweet Tooth which has a mango-like taste with a lime finish.  It's a good spot to bring a laptop and code, too."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Ritual recently went through a remodel and it looks great. I liked the open, clean and bright lines of the new area. I ordered a cappuccino and really enjoyed it. It wasn't too strong or bitter. The only short fall of this cafe  -  no WiFi. I guess they are trying something new and apparently received a lot of good feedback about it. However, for me it was a bit of a disappointment. I was planning reading on my Ipad and relax with my cup but without WiFi my time there was cut short.  I totally would go back for the coffee and hope they change their mind about the WiFi soon."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Friendly staff, outdoors public parklet, coffee tasted like they described, some anís"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The coffee is so good here....and you have options! The do individual drips for all the coffee, so it's super fresh. Great place to hang out with a friend or study with your computer. Everyone that works their is super friendly too!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"So many vegan pastry options! a scone with vegan pepperoni was the strangest, must satisfying thing i’ve eaten in recent memory. the kind barista noted that the chocolate covered rice crispy treat was also vegan  — sold! clean bathrooms. nice coffee. good music. no wifi. a lot of seating, none of which was available — very popular location."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Some of my favorite coffee in the city in this popular hipster cafe on the corner of 21st and Valencia. I would recommend the iced latte and grabbing one of the many seats to catch up with a friend or get some work done. It has some of the speedier wifi I've found as well.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the mission. Strong coffee game, good wifi and lots of places to sit. I'm slightly partial to the pre-remodel hipster vibe but the update brings in a lot more light and seating."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great latte coffees, and drip coffee, but was a little disappointed when I ordered a single shot americano. I was expecting a nice delicious crema on top from the extraction from the espresso shot, but no. It seems like they made it backwards, they made an espresso shot, poured hot water over the espresso shot and just killed my coffee!!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Your blue haired barista is rude. Couldn't tell you how the coffee is because I got out of line and left. A woman let me in front of her in line (we walked up at the same time), then I got yelled at that I needed to get to the back of the line. K. Bye."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Now this is a place I do like and there are lines out the door and it is full of hipsters.  But the coffee is actually good.  And they make it quickly.  They don't do some jingle jangle dangle water over a pot for 30 minutes dance.  They just make the coffee and get you on your way.  Thank you.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Friendly, welcoming, well decorated space. Lots of seating and tables but no public wifi."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"There are two kinds of coffee snobs. One that believes that there are different tastes and that good quality roasters can produce varied flavors. Many believe that the full bodied flavor of a medium roast is generally superior to a dark roast, but allows for the fact that some people like dark roasts.  The other is the kind that believes that their way is the only ""right"" way. This is the point-of-view I received at Ritual Coffee Roasters.  I know that I like a 16oz Mocha Breve with 2 shots of medium roast espresso. They believe that I'm ruining the flavor of the coffee with an excessive ratio of milk to coffee. I was actually a little hungry and wanted a 20oz triple. I was scoffed at.  Their biggest cup size is 12oz."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,These folks know what they're doing & their care for each cup is delightful! It's all about the coffee here. The crowd looks like they're from Central Casting (we need hipsters with laptops!) but whatever pretensions they exude are well earned. Pricey but worth it.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The espresso is amazing still, but the new decor is awful.  I used to go to Ritual on a weekly basis for a mid-day break and relax with a mocha in an armchair, but since the remodeling I've only been back once, and probably wont return again. I'm not sure what they were going for with the remodeling, but the result is bland and unproductive.  All but one of the power outlets were removed, and there is no wifi available giving the sense they wanted to stop people working there. However the comfy couches and arm chairs were all removed, replaced with workspace-style chairs and tables, like they are expecting people to stay and work rather than relax or read books. The music, which before was always a nice variety, was nothing but 90's rock that you might expect at your doctor's office. The walls, which before were covered in art are now smooth wood paneling, devoid of character.  About the only good thing to come from the remodeling is there is AC now, so those hot Mission summers are kept out.  All in all, I may go back for the coffee if I happen to be in the area, but it is no longer a destination for me."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Banking on their significant reputation in years past, Ritual renovated and poured a lot of money into becoming a more commercial coffee shop. Their quality suffered. If they shaved $1 off the price of everything in the store and added back more couches, I'd give them 4 stars again, but they made some bad decisions and the coffee scene on valencia between 21st and 22nd declined somewhat."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"the NUMBER ONE coffee place for me! I'd love to request more locations, but I also really enjoy the niche culture of patrons.  Their baristas really know they're stuff, have amazing blends to offer, and take their coffee seriously.  Make sure to  check out kiosk in the Garden. It's on 1634 Jerrold Ave in Bayview-Hunters Point.  Keep it up Ritual!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Super mellow place with friendly servers and eclectic drink menu and music. Good for chilling and getting some work done. Has public seating in front and road traffic is not too noisy. Recommended!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Love this place! The lady left out one cup of coffee from our order at first, but she reordered it for us for free. So lovely!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I love how they offer so many vegan and gluten free items that are still affordable. This is such a wonderful addition and great for anyone who is looking for a wide selection of vegan desserts and espresso drinks.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Ritual is an institution. However, my experience was sub standard. A mocha without the tip is $7. On a medium busy Sunday morning the crew managed to lose our order, we waited around for 15 minutes.  When we checked in on that, I did not get an apology but a rather blank stare (Call me old-fashion but I expected the former). We were handed a free drink voucher with the beverage, which turned out weak and not worth it."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"excellent coffee, friendly staff, nice atmosphere!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Nice coffee shop with lots of seating and a nice bench in the back with a cute little ""forest"" area by the window. The music was just way too loud and I couldn't even hear myself think. Coffee was good though."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Great coffee! But... not a type of coffee place to do stuff like studying or working. They don’t have wifi (can’t imagine a coffee place w/o wifi these days). And I don’t see any electric ports around for charging.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,My preferred cold brew in the city. Great vive - feels like some kind of Swedish farmhouse of the future (minimalist meets polished reclaimed wood and random loops of overhead lighting). Prices correspond as you'd thus expect.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Coffee roaster on the fancy side. The place isn’t what we could call “warm and welcoming"" but more on the colder, modern side but beautiful.  I ordered a pricey cold brew. For the price of 4$ I expected either a quite big size or either a cold brew I would remember forever. It was none of those. Small and just okay. I wouldn’t come back for a cold brew but maybe give it another chance for a hot drink.  Also, no WiFi. Come on guys, this should be pretty standard in a 21st century coffee shop."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"If you love Starbucks you'll HATE this place. Ritual is for folk who truly like quality espresso and coffee carefully roasted in small batches......oh, and if you have tattoos, use a Mac, are under 30 and don't have a real job you'll LOVE Ritual. Park your fixie out front and come on in!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Love this place, im kinda happy they don't have wifi, but those peeps keep taking over the tables for their laptops.  Outdoor seating is nice for a good weathered day.  Definitely stop by and enjoy their wall art,  and good convo"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,The best coffee I've come across in SF. No WiFi - but that means fewer macbooks taking up space (which is at a premium seeing as they're redecorating right now). The atmosphere was super chilled and they had an amazing playlist on the speakers.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Excellent pour overs and espresso drinks. The SF Proxy stand in Hayes Valley is superb to grab a cup of coffee on your way into work or while taking a midday break. Some of the best coffee beans in SF.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,No wife but great coffee and space!!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Nice, spacious interior. I'm not really a coffee person so I decided to get tea.  The staff taking orders wasn't very friendly and the Huang Meigui was very very very very mild. Not a very pleasant or memorable experience."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Only one charger in the whole place which is loose so I'm sitting by some random wall and holding it in with my shin so the plug does not fall out #quality  Otherwise the coffee is great!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee and my favorite ginger scones. The seating area is bigger than many coffee shops in the city, so you can settle in with friends or your laptop for a couple hours."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I'll admit I didn't have a great impression of Ritual when I first came because the coffee was a bit tart but I love their espresso and they make a mean latte and cappuccino. It's a bit expensive but I don't mind paying the premium to get a quality cappuccino topped with creamy Califia almond milk. They recently renovated, and the space is clean and new (note: no wifi). They are also now constructing a cute little parklette just outside."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"still no indoor seating, masks required, slow service. at least the coffee was okay, but i recommend to look elsewhere for ambiance and culture."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I've ordered espresso drinks several times at this place and I can tell you right now that their baristas aren't educated well enough on how to make a good cup of espresso- each espresso I've had here comes out tasting very sour AND not one has had a good layer of crema on top- those are 2 signs the espresso hasn't been made correctly. A well-made espresso should never taste sour- earthy, yes, but not sour- and a truly well-made cup of espresso will ALWAYS have a nice layer of crema on top that doesn't dissipate right away. If the crema dissipates quickly, that is a sign the espresso hasn't been properly made. Too many coffee houses in SF these days think they're so hip but don't make good espresso. This is one of those places."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Another best coffee place. The coffee here is so good, and they open til very late. I used to come here to study alot because one, they have good coffee, caffeine to wake me up, and free WIFI. I love their brownie too, so rich. it goes perfect with their capuchino."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"While a bit overpriced, the quality of Ritual is spectacular and the location pre-construction offered countless places to do work. Always packed on the weekends with laptops, you will be lucky if you can find a spot. Long lines may be a deterrent but the coffee is spot on!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Really good coffee and nice looking shop with ample space to sit down and enjoy your brew. I was a bit disappointed with the almond croissant as it was very dry, perhaps just bad luck as everything in the cabinet looked great."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Good taste in coffee. The Almond square was so dam good.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I don't understand why this place is as popular as it is. High prices, unremarkable quality. I go out of my way to avoid their drip coffee as it tastes like grass. Better off going to Blue Fig 20 seconds down the street."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Time for a Ritual early evening brew ha ha  Ritual Coffee Roasters in the Mission District was the site for my first ever coffee cupping class.  I vividly remember the Nicaragua episode of ""Bizarre Foods"", where Andrew Zimmern slurped & spat his way through various coffee, noting the distinctive notes of each brew.  I now had the chance to see how loud a slurp I could make, distinguishing from various single origin coffee.  All the while, enjoying a high octane caffeine boost to power me on for the night.  Sho was our barista, and he led us through the cupping process.  Starting with South American coffee, and onward to Ethiopian grinds, Sho had us sniff the dry grinds, to envision the flavor notes in our head.  Then, after brewing for a certain amount of minutes, Sho had our group sniff the brewed grinds, to see if the flavor notes we experienced before still applied or were altered in any way.  Afterwards, came the highlight of any coffee cupping - tasting!  Sho demonstrated the artisan way of tasting.  By using a spoon & slowly lowering it into the brew, we slurped the coffee as loud and fast as possible, which we spat out.  Tasting this way sprays the coffee onto the tastebuds, allowing for maximum savoring.  In my opinion, the South American coffee had more sweet/floral profiles, whereas the Ethiopian coffee had bold/more assertive flavors.  What was on the unhygienic side, was we used a communal cup to wash our spoons before each sipping.  All I can say is, I was glad I was the second one & not further down the line.  Upon our coffee cupping class coming to completion, we all had our choice of drink from Ritual Coffee Roasters.  Wanting some cold with a kick, I went with Ritual's nitro cold brew-  Cold, slightly acidic, caffeine-laden, the nitro cold brew hit the spot.  For the uninitiated, nitro cold brew coffee is akin to coffee beer.  Frothy, slightly bubbly & having a stoutness to it, the drink is made the day before to remove most of the acidity.  By cold brewing, the nitro cold brew contains more caffeine than traditional drip coffee.  Refreshing as can be!  Service was great.  Sho was quite professional during the class, communicating in unpretentious terms about coffee and the brewing process.  Our drinks came out in a timely manner and we even received free can cozys.  A fair amount of seating inside, with 2 communal tables (in front & in back).  A few tables for those alone or with someone.  Most available seating is al fresco, via wooden tables overlooking Valencia St.  Metered street parking is hard to come by, so try to visit during off hours when possible.  While I'm not a ritual coffee enthusiast,  I do enjoy the brew at Ritual Coffee Roasters.  All the coffee beans at Ritual are roasted in San Francisco, keeping things local.  Drinks are made one cup at a time, and customers can see the attention & care that goes into the products offered here.  I had an educational & entertaining time, participating in my first coffee cupping, and Sho was as great a teacher as any during the process.  There are many café options in the city of San Francisco, and it would behoove you to make Ritual Coffee Roasters one of them.  Highly recommend! NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Pricey.  Great beans.  Mediocre cold brew.   Great location, nice remodel, and fantastic parket to sit at.   However, not very friendly to general public unless you are a full blown hipster or starving artist."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Asked for an iced americano with an extra shot. Specifically clarified that I didn't want extra water, just ICE. Ended up getting a hot americano... After tip, I paid $7 for a coffee i didn't even order and unfortunately I was REALLY looking forward to an ICED drink. I gave two stars because they have good coffee, but they could definitely pay a little more attention next time so that I can get what I ordered and paid for."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Good atmosphere, good barista, very tasty hot chocolate"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Funky little coffee shop with cool artwork on the walls.  There were a good amount of spaces to sit and a variety of styles of those spaces too, from tables and chairs, to a bar by the window looking out at the street."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Mission hipster coffee at its finest. Lots of regulars here, if you're new your will stick out but don't let that stop you from getting because the coffee here is on point.  Blue wall makes for great photos for you instagram freaks :)"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Decent space and thats about it. Girl with purple hair running the register has a condensing attitude, like you're wasting her time. And who runs a coffee shop with no wifi. Definitely  a waste of my time and money here."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Staff is very knowledgeable about coffee and what to look for.  The hot chocolate was delicious.  The beans are very unique. Quality control is important to this brand, and it shows in the coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The venue is really cool but the people who work here aren't super knowledgeable and have a pretty difficult time realizing they have a job due to paying customers who like coming here to get their enjoyment of coffee.  I liked the coffee very much, unfortunately service here left me with a bitter taste."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"If you are looking for the best coffee in SF, Ritual is one of them but don't forget about Pinhole and Cafe St Jorge and the legendary Four Barrel. All these are  ""Rube Goldberg-made coffee"" :-)"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,This place has authentic coffee and their pastry iis really tasty. I like how their stuff is not too sweet and the coffee is strong. I past by this place everyday for work and I would get a quick cup of coffee to drink.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Espresso so and so. Got that particularly sharp bitterness that I only experienced in few places in the SF/Bay Area. I'm really curious if the beans or the water bring out this flavor.  You can even smell it when you walk into the place. So, not really my cup of ... coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee, plain and simple. They put a lot of effort and work into making a very impressive coffee. Not as great an atmosphere as other SF coffee havens but it does a great coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Another favorite for coffee in the city. Ritual roasters not only has great coffee, but also roasts regularly and always has a fresh selection. Typically has a line, but worth the wait."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Goood vibes and good coffee. No public wifi and there are few charging points which is why I'm withholding a couple of stars. Great place to meet friends but NOT to work because of the above reason.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Their pour over coffee is very good. If you like pour over, I highly recommend this coffee shop."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Conflicted about this place because I love the coffee shop much and can't stand the people who rudely serve it to me. If you can just go to Four Barrel where they're still hipster but will treat you nicely. Lines will be long at both anyway.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Excellent coffee, tops in the neighborhood. Their outsize reputation and high volume make the service and atmosphere less than special, but the baristas' skill is undeniable."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Delicious coffee. We are visiting and had to find a great coffee… this was it!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"With so many coffee spots in the area it's hard to stand out, but Ritual consistently has exceptional coffee due to their sourced beans and professional roasts."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,It's spacious and seems LGBT friendly 👦🏻 …
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great place to meet with friends, get a little work done or read. I ordered tea so I can't say how good or bad the coffee is. I just liked that it wasn't extremely busy and there were places to sit!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,My first coffee love. It still holds a soft spot in my heart. I don't love every cup I get nowadays but I still come across some of my favorites here. And I'm always happy to try.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Good coffee. Wish it was cozier.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Noisy, super expensive and most of the plugs are cut off... so you can't charge your laptop... beside that... coffee is pretty good... but the place awfull"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"They use compostable lids on their to-go cups! Since composting is REQUIRED for all residences in San Francisco, this means you don't have to feel guilty about getting a to-go cup since you can just throw it in your compost bin at home (obviously, reusable is still best, but when you don't have your reusable cup with you...). Hardly any of the coffee shops in San Francisco do this - most use the non-compostable, non-recyclable black or white lids that just clog up landfills. Kudos, Ritual!!!"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,The vegan donuts are very good but come early to get them as they often sell out! Obviously the coffee is great as well and the staff is pleasant.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Very good, can't go wrong. Not the BEST coffee I've had in sf but definitely top 5"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great place to have coffee but most importantly to buy coffee beans. We go for the espresso blends, they have a bunch of various recurring ones (Stickball, La Cima, Gicherori, Carrizal...) while hard to know which one will be available, and seasonal espresso blends (Sugar Skull, Cabin Fever, Seersucker... and just now Hunters in the Snow). Usually a 12oz bag runs at about $17. The beans are always freshly roasted, at the most a few days old. So far we always went back to it after buying beans from other places such as Blue Bottle, Four Barrel etc..."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Good coffee, but a little overpriced for what it is. IMO, Philz is way better. The lines can also get pretty long and the shop can be crowded with all the hipsters ""working"" there."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Great coffee but lacks a little atmosphere (or comfort to sit around); perhaps that's the goal though? Still coffee is pretty good and you can always sit outside if the weather is nice
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Really good coffee, and a good place to hang out. They have a cool boat-parklet out front now. They got rid of their WiFi, though, so keep that in mind if you're going there to work."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The flagship ritual store was remodeled a year or two ago. Clean open space inside, and of course wonderful and consistent Ritual Coffee. A go to place on Valencia Street corridor"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Unbelievably rude staff, no obvious sign that their restroom was not available, my 85 y/o father needed to use a rest room (we had already ordered our coffee) and the staff refused to let him use the employee restroom, basic lack of human kindness"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Pretty standard for upscale coffee shops in SF. A good but not great amount of seating. The best seating is probably the public benches outside.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Wasn't a fan of their nitro cold brew. It simply tasted watered down. That coupled with no Wi-Fi will keep me from returning. Nice atmosphere otherwise and nice service.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Ultra pricey, neon industrial warehouse decor, small amd under flavored coffees, no wifi, no eye contact from it's overly chic patrons, and few, rigid seats. Go to borderlands if you're human and like to do human things."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"By far the smoothest tasting cup of coffee in town, individually brewed to order. Diverse customers, bright space, staff never appear rushed."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"The coffee's first rate, however for the benefit of fellow travellers without data: as of yesterday 8th Nov 2014 there's no wifi, despite what other reviews say."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"It's a good place to go and hang out with friends . The service is good. When I was there was no wi -fi signal available, unfortunately , made a difference to have a better time.  The coffee is pretty good."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Ritual always reminds me of a communist flag. The coffee is subtle and not too strong. I always pick up a bag of beans to go. The cafe has free wifi and nice big tables for an afternoon to work.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,This is my favorite cafe in the world. They make an amazing cup of joe. I really like how they've changed recently as well. Having the barista talk to me about the different beans to help me make a selection is great.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Artisanal coffee at its go-to hipster best.  Some cool trends are worth backing; this is one of them, and Ritual is one of the best places to get coffee with real flavor."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Crowded. Small tables. Coffee is never great, sometimes ok, sometimes has that burned flavor (cheap beans). No wifi. Only good thing is the smiling staff. Hopefully never again"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This cup of coffee was good.  I mean really good.  I mean great.  I mean amazing.  I mean wow - I wish I could have that every single day. I had an almond milk latte with Mi Cafetal espresso beans of the Caturra variety from Gigante, Huila, Colombia (got all that??) Anyway - go to Ritual...they will take care of the rest."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Great coffee. They also sell vegan donuts from People's donuts that are yummy but make sure to arrive early as these tend to sell out super quickly.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I agree that staffs are not super nice, but I was thirsty, hot, and need the place to chill down for real. It was a heaven to have iced decaf latte! Very roasted, but gentle."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,A really nice looking ritual but the back of the place stinks. It's right by the bathroom but there's gotta be a way to keep it smelling fresh. Pretty unfortunate as the place is very nice otherwise :(..
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee. A perfect pick me up in the afternoon. It's really close to where I frequent. It's not one of those ""cutesy"" coffee shops, definitely has flair."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Very tasty special latte& cappucino. Very pleasant outside benches and green area, for drinking the coffee."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Great coffee. The best I've had in SF during my 2 week stay. Perfect break from shopping on Valencia Street.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Highly recommend their cold brew coffee!
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Delicious coffee, awesome ambiance, there’s always a seat even if it looks full. Only downside is the music that tries to be louder than the chatter, calls for a headache :/"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,The best.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Nicest looking coffee shop for sure, but only serving so so coffee at a higher cost. The girl working there needs training in customer service. I get better service at gas stations."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Nice bright space with very friendly people. Tried the Ethiopian coffee. Was a bit too much for me but liked it nevertheless. No WiFi though.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"They have a great selection of coffee. Since their focus is on producing something different instead of something consistent, they can source beans from a more diverse range of growers."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Although Philz Coffee and Blue Bottle predate it, Ritual Coffee, I feel, is the SF roaster that really mass-educated the local market about third-wave coffee, originally serving Stumptown coffee until they started sourcing, roasting, and selling their own beans."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"I expected the coffee to be good, since that's their reputation, and it really was.  But the space was nice too, one of the better coffee shop spaces I've been to in the city."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"This place is almost a parody of gentrification. In a huge space, coffee that comes with lengthy descriptions of the farms it comes from. Unfortunately, the coffee isn't particularly good, the place isn't particularly comfortable, and even by Bay Area standards, it's ludicrously overpriced."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Love that this place has great coffee (hello pourovers!) AND WiFi. That is SUCH a rarity in the city.  This is a great place to work: not too loud, WiFi, decent sized tables"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,A surprisingly bright and modern space featuring single pour over coffee. A nice little place to break away in the middle of the day and enjoy a quiet cup of coffee.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Great coffee, great pastries, lovely space, I'd ding it half a star because the space is so loud and echoey especially for a place with constantly running coffee grinders."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,The first wave of those highfalutin SF coffee stores that opened at the beginning of this millennia Less scientifically sterile an environment than the places that look like it's made by people in white lab coats Good tasting They play much cooler music than those paces too Very decent joe Very fun place to hang out
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Tasty coffee here although this place is too loud for a guest to have a chat. There is no wi-fi either, it's hard to understand the reason behind it."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Really like this place. It has good coffee for people who like coffee and for those that don't a great selection of Song teas.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Incredibly rude staff. Lowered my mask for a second to have a sip of water and the cashier yelled at me, this is after the mask mandate has been lifted btw"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Very stylish coffee place with lots of choices. Their bags of beans are super expensive but hey, I can get those at home in Holland."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,I can't speak to the coffee here as I ordered tea. Baristas are friendly and efficient. The space can be quite packed; prepare to hover for a table.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,A+ coffee. The service was good but the coffee was amazing. Same price as large coffee shops but the coffee quality is far better and the store is quieter.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,best of the best coffees in town. any option will be good over here. lattes and almond croissants my fave (but donoughts aren't bad either)
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Overpriced. No Wifi. You have to wear a mask for the twelve seconds you order? K bye.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Amazing, very easy space with fantastic coffee"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Good place. Delicious coffee. It would be nice if the staff was a little more smiley and overall nice.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,"Coffee is expensive, but coffee is so goooood. It's really crowded at this location on weekends, but probably chill during the week."
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Coffee is not bad but being forced to wear a mask while they serve you behind a screen is a little too scary for me. Let’s wake up guys.
Ritual Coffee Roasters,1026 Valencia St,Incredible coffee. World class espresso with three options for beans. Great pour over menu and knowledgeable baristas.
