Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,Both the kiosk by the woods and the cafe by the street are great option for a cup of fine coffee depending on your mood. Love the Cortado with balanced mix of beans and milks. Pet friendly. Lot of seats and lot of spaces. Great place in SF for a break.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Stopped in for breakfast coffee n food. First time here.  Got got Hot Chocolate which tasted powdery, and a Chai which tasted like a Mexican (spicy) hot chocolate.  Also grabbed a Danish which was very good.   All the pastries looked great but none were labeled.  Had to keep interrupting the only person working the counter.  Service was below average, but probly because they only had one employee at the counter.  Place was kinda dark inside, but had a good vibe.  Location is extremely convenient if going to Golden Gate Park."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Okay-ish coffee. The cappuccino was good, but not spectacular. The Nitro BREW had some weird taste, we didn’t like it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Hip coffee cafe. Friendly and helpful staff. Coffee was not the best I have had in SF, but just my opinion, you may love it. Everything else is excellent s."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Always a great time, spacious and amazing coffee! Small cute patio at the back, perfect for a sunny day. Wifi included for 2 hours w a purchase"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Excellent atmosphere for doing some laptop work with delicious coffee, great staff, and across the street from the incredible Golden Gate Park!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,Hipster cafe nearby UCSF hospital. I got latte with oatmilk👍🏽This place is good for gathering. (not a silent study cafe) But parking is really hard to find…! or you need to pay street parking around the park and Whole Foods Market.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,Nice cafe with one of the best hot chocolates I’ve had.. I got their coffee beans for my husband and he loves their coffee.. if you’re lucky you can find street parking.. I’ll be back here again to try different items on their menu.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,They know what they’re doing! Really good coffee!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Came here on a Sunday morning and though the line was long, it turns out that it was well justified! I got a pour-over and my partner got a nitro and they were both incredibly good! Like, one of the best coffees of my life! We both got baked goods, mine were gluten-free (thank you for having gluten-free items!) that were high quality and tasty."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,Located next to the Golden Gate Park. Legit coffee but the cappuccino was a bit too hot to my liking.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,My daily coffee call recommended by our AirBnb.. amazing coffee and tasty pastry selection. Highly recommend for a satisfying caffeine break 😎 …
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,Amazing coffee shop to get some work done! The WiFi is solid and so is the coffee! Don’t miss the coffee crumble cake - I devoured it in less than 5 mins! Would love to go back!
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"I mean this cafe is incredible. The coffee here is fantastic. Great great specialty coffee shop with siphon brewing. While it doesn’t radically change the coffee, it’s a good experience to have. Make you feel fancy. The cafe is nice and big, with a cute patio in a back. Definitely should go here!! We bought a bag off coffee, which did not disappoint!"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,I was nearby and wanted to try this cafe. Not bad coffee at all.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Nice cafe just outside golden gate park, not exceptional. The blueberry crumb cake is quite tasty, and fairly priced. The juice, on the other hand, a bit too expensive."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"This place is highly recommended by my peers so I had to check it out! The place is cozy and the staff are friendly. I had my first ever mocha here which was delicious. The gold rush was alright, but the tortilla stuck to the foil and I had to scrape it off with a spoon. Would come again for the coffee.  Total was $11"
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"Great vibes, excellent coffee. Lots of space to sit, stand, hang out, and work. Good wifi and accessible power outlets. My only complaint is that they were understaffed for weekend rushes. I was there for almost four hours on a Sunday and the staff were busting their butts trying to keep up with demand basically the whole time. I think customers and staff could benefit from the owner scheduling at least one more person on busy weekends. And given the volume of business, it seems like they can afford it."
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,Excellent atmosphere to sip coffee and get some work done. Limited timed wifi.
Flywheel Coffee Roasters,672 Stanyan St,"10/10 espresso, 10/10 atmosphere. Nice low lighting. You could spend all day here. Super friendly baristas. Lots of people WFH here. But again, coffee is 10/10 incredible. You can tell they put their heart into their roasts."
