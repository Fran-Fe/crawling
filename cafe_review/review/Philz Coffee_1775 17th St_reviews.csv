Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Great drip coffee. The mocha tesora is a great cross between coffee and hot chocolate. Location is bright with free wifi and about 4 tables. There's also an outside patio area where they have a few additional tables and chairs. A little busy on a Sunday midday, but not over crowded. Staff was fine, but strictly business."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"THE Coffee place. Occasionally, I'll have coffee. Mostly, however, I get the hot chocolate with cream. Oh My God! Angels sweep their wings over every cup.  Since I don't drink coffee anymore, Philz hot chocolate leads the parade for me. Nectar of the gods! Thanks Phil."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I am a philz fan for life and am never disappointed regardless of which location I go to. However, special mention to Philz Portrero!! I went around closing time and was given a free bag of pastries 🥐🥧🎂 …"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Are there beverages are amazing. I personally enjoy their black Tessaro coffee. Just be ready to wait for your coffee because they are made to order fresh.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"The best coffee I’ve had! I got a small, hot Tesora with cream and honey and it was delicious. Boyfriend got a hot Philtered Soul which was also great. Staff was also super sweet. Would definitely return."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Loved this one - drink was good, service was great, scone was pretty good but wasnt mind-blowing. Smaller, but nice layout and very cozy. Loved the infrastructure. Would come again."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,The best chained coffee store in the entire country. I've tried all the varieties of the medium roast coffee here and each coffee is better than the other.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Open early at 5:30 which was great since we had to be at Oracle to work the Spartan event. It was hard to find a place with good coffee that was open early and I was NOT about to go to Starbucks!
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Small and cosy place. staff really friendly and faster than any other Philz place I'd ever been. My favorite is the mint iced coffee !
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Cozy and little happy place for a special coffee, kind staffs. Coffee is good and different from other store."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"This place can get pretty packed since it’s not that big, but it’s in a safe location and has a lot of parking nearby. And they allow dogs inside!"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Great service. Easy to find, very friendly staff, in and out quickly. Coffee was tasty, in and out in like 10 minutes."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I came this Sunday morning at 7:30. The barista, who was alone at the counter, was particularly rude. The coffee, ""light roast"", which I took, had a very present bitterness, so it was probably over-extracted. And the ""egg and bacon"" burrito was downright average. Really disappointing experience in this chain of coffee shops which I was testing for the first time. I go back to France with a bad impression of Philz coffee."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"As of April 9, 2021 no inside seating. But there are seats outside. The service is fast and friendly. The parking is a challenge but the 19 bus line is 10 steps from door. I never been a fan of coffee store snacks so i have no review. The afternoon foot traffic was very smooth. I like the neighborhood. In fact, directly across the street is the SFPD bomb detection warehouse and Whole Foods is located 3 blocks from the Philz."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"ordered a small filtered soul and was waiting right there, but apparently the baristas were too busy talking to a certain customer. they were calling names out but didn't call mine at all. I saw a lonely drink sitting there and sure enough it was mine. the baristas are just a lil too friendly with other people and forget other people just want to get their coffee and go, no offense. another customer was apparently experiencing long wait times with their drink too"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Philz has become my favorite coffee chain in SF. Their menu is pretty unique with a variety of blended beverages that aren’t available in a lot of regular espresso machine coffee shops. They are also very friendly and have a cool app to order ahead. If you are looking for variety in non creamy coffee drinks, this is the place."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Very nice, Super tasty coffee, good price, nice staff, literally perfect"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I am a big fan of the staff at this location, and I like to make the walk and do some work with a coffee. The pastries are on the expensive side, and I will always be sad that the ""toast"" items are off the menu since COVID.  It gets traffic, but I don't think it has the hustle and bustle of the Folsom/24th street location.  Lots of police officers and firefighters come in for their Joe from the stations in the area."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"This is a fairly new location compared to other Philz in the are. The interior is nice, prices are more or less same as other Philz. I had the mint mojito and I love that it wasn't too sweet with just the right amount of mint flavor! All the staff members encountered were really nice. Street parking actually available! Overall, I had a great first Philz experience!"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"A little different than what I'm used to, but I stumbled in here and was pleasantly surprised. They specialize in pour over coffee. I didn't know how to order here and you have to place your order at the bar first, but they were friendly and helpful and the barista gave me a few recommendations based on what I like. I even went with a little almond milk in my coffee which I never do but I was happily surprised. Philz will be a new destination for me when I'm in the area again."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"My advice, get the mojito latte and avacado toast. It's delicious"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Best. Coffee. Ever. Philz makes each cup of coffee to order. Each cup. It's pretty awesome. And the baristas at this particular place are always smiling and giving you good tips if you don't know exactly what you want! Go Philz!
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I remember when Philz only had like 1-2 locations in the city. It's nice to see that it's such a hit with so many locations all over SF now!  I like this particular location since it's mostly out of high traffic areas (think: downtown locations). Don't get me wrong, this location still gets busy with lines practically out the door, but overall it's not as bad as the others I've been to. Plus, it's walkable from my work and other nearby work places (and near a bus stop if you're not quite as close).  The staff here are friendly and want to make sure you're happy with your drink before you take off. Recently, I tried the gingersnap iced coffee based on the barista's recommend and it was great! It was perfect for a warm day. The drink was a bit sweet, but when it's named after a cookie, what else do you expect? lol  Random bonus, it's beside an ice cream shop and ice cream + coffee is a fab combination ;)"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I like this place, but expect it to take awhile to get a cup of coffee, and if you don't know what you want - or you're just looking for a cup of Joe think of going somewhere else - Their menu has like 30 options!  Their staff is amazing and always chipper, they're wonderful. They also have really great music generally."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"The drinks aside from coffee are not good, so avoid those.  The selection of allergen friendly food (plant based and gluten free) could use some work.  The vibe is nice and the quality of coffee, high."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Great coffee friendly staff. Tons to choose from
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"This place is good if you like a wide variety of coffee options.  The pour over takes a little extra time so maybe not the best place if you are trying to be in and out.  They do offer easy online ordering, but as a visitor to the city the extra effort of setting that up was unattractive."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"It was great, the barista was extra cool. Lines were ling but moving at a good pace. The girl at the register seems kind of unfit for the job, she doesn't really have a warm welcoming energy about her like the baristas do.  Her interaction with other customers seemed lifeless and plain."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"This is one of my favorite locations, partially due to its proximity to where I live, but unlike some of the locations downtown that get super busy, this one is off the beaten path enough that it is a little quieter and wasoer to get in and out if you're in a rush. I've always have had great service here and theor team has consistently delivered great coffee and breakfast treats."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"After extensive discussion with the Barista on how I wanted my coffee prepared, I got how they wanted to make it for me.  It was bitter, gassy and I could not regrettably finish half of it.  I ordered milk not half and half and it was attempted creaming into consumption.  Nice folks but not real coffee creators like myself.  Have to say I believe they rely on density, not craft, to make their money.  Does us honest coffee artists bad.  Boo..  The LC  Update 6/2018:  I went back to try another time and the Jamaica Blue Mountain, which I was not opposed to paying $7.67 for, was ruined and a waste of money."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Great service, great coffee"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Philz app is great. Really easy to order coffee but needs a stories feature like Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn etc. otherwise perfect coffee experience."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"The lines can be a little long sometimes, and there are lots of cops due to there being a vehicle yard across the street (if that kind of thing bothers you)... But the coffee is excellent and the staff is always attentive and cheery.  They've got light snacks and Pepples vegan doughnuts also."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Unbelievable coffee, delicious every time. This locations has awesome service, the people are so nice and welcoming. They don't serve the toasts here, but they do have the breakfast sandwiches and wraps."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Great coffee. Personalized service! Intentionally learned names of repeat customers. Nice!
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"If you're new to Philz - don't even think about it, you HAVE to go. They have a system where you get your own barista that crafts each drink just for you. My two recommendations: iced mint mojito coffee (if you can only come once this is the drink to get) and gingersnap iced coffee. I usually get my coffee black everywhere else, but I always have my coffee the Philz way here - medium sweet with cream. They are very conscious of how their coffee beans are sourced. They have plenty of outlets as well. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO DC PHILZ ❤️"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Friendly staff, good coffee, what more could you ask for?! Like any Philz, it can definitely get busy during ""rush hour"", but if you don't mind waiting a few minutes, you'll be treated to a good dose of caffeine."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Hillary gave us killer service. She was super friendly and got our orders quickly even though they were busy
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"There is no comparison other than price.  Philz is my one true vice.  I just got back to the Bay last night and can't wait for my morning fix!  Try a Silken Soul (yes 2 coffee bean blends!  I love these people) with half and half, no sugar (sugar just gets in the way of that delicious coffeeeeeee!).  McDonald's is my next go to.  The coffee is mild but fragrant.   I'd choose it over Starbucks (Starbitter or is it Bitterbucks?) anyday."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I spilled my drink here and the staff were super friendly and cleaned it up. I felt super bad because I literally got Hot Chocolate EVERYWHERE. I mean literally everywhere including all over a  leather chair.  Also, they made me a new one!"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Nice place, clean and comfortable. The coffee is most excellent and so is the staff.  Been here only a handful of times and haven't been through the whole menu."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Potrero Hill now has its own Philz - and what a nice addition to the Philz family it is. Spacious, neat interior design, friendly baristas, not (yet) crowded, and even parking (on a good day). I like that once you enter the store there is no guesswork where to line up - the set up is pretty logical and makes it easy to get your drink. My favorite is still the SILKEN SPLENDOR ($4).  If you're a Philz addict and fan come here for your t-shirts and Philz merchandise, too."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Nice location, always quick, and great coffee. About a 50/50 chance you’ll get a spot to sit inside, but there’s outdoor seating too if the weather is nice enough."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Love this location! Chill local coffee shop vibe. Friendly staff, amazing coffee, and fast service. Prefer this over Starbucks literally every time."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"The staff is always attentive, now matter how busy they are. They have a eclectic music diversity (old school hip-hop, modern rock, pop, etc.)"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Philz coffee is one of my favorites. I love the selection and that every cup is made fresh. It is definitely worth the wait as each cup is made fresh.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"There are many now, but Philz will be my go to coffee whenever I'm in the SF Bay area. It's head and shoulders above mass market chains and gas more soul than the other fancy SF coffee houses."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Their Mint Mojito is a must try. delicious.  Great coffees that are delicious. You can even mobile order and pick up after.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Great low key Philz location in Potrero Hill. Doesnt get too crowded & almost no lines ever.  Friendly & sweet staff. Calm & cozy spot to enjoy coffee.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"You can order ahead and your coffee will be ready in you're in a hurry. Otherwise, chill and check out the art on the walls or order food while you wait for your perfect cup to brew."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"They have two sizes, small or large. The menu is all coffee, and the coffee is fantastic. Plenty of spaces to sit and a nice courtyard."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,The coffee was amazing. Each cup perfectly crafted. They grind the beans right in front of you for the most fresh brew.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Like every other Philz, this is some of the best pour over coffee around. But just don't get the Red Haze because I hate it hen thy run out of my favorite blend."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I had never heard of Philz, but I was impressed with the quality of the coffee. Very helpful staff. It was worth the slightly longer walk from CCA."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Everything was top-notch - banana loaf, chocolate brownie, bacon & onion croissant and za'tar twist."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Their coffee is always amazing!!!  I order on the app and they are super quick too.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"by far my fav Philz location I have ever been to...so cute, so organized, and that day the barrista made me the best mint mojito Philz has made.."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"I've always experienced great service. They make your drink to your liking. If it's not perfect, just tell them."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Nice cozy spot for coffee or tea. Not too much room for guest and their companions(big groups). Great atmosphere.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Went time they knew my name on next visit also the coffee ☕ I wanted but didn't taste like the wonderbar I had the first time.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Great coffee my favorite in SF, just know it can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 based on how busy it is"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"We had our coffee outside near the fountain, quite relaxing."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Great place to hang out and enjoy a cup of coffee. I really like trying the coffee beans of the month to bring home.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"The ""Ecstatic"" coffee is the bomb!!!!!"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Amazing coffee and awesome staff in a hip area of town.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"My favorite, but lines can be longs sometimes. Turkish is excellent and mint is amazing in coffee!"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Better than starbucks.  Still feel kinda silly paying $5 for a cup of coffee.  But it's a darn good cup of coffee.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Coffee's great places chill but all blends is not ideal for me so four stars.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Mint Mojito coffee is the bomb. Especially in the summer heat. Great place to get coffee. No complaints.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,For me its always difficult to ask for a simple coffee in this place. They have their own complicated way to prepare coffee and it's always terrible.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Good quiet Philz spot,  spacious with outdoor space. Good spot to work long hours if needed."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Never had a more warm and welcoming experience at a coffee shop as I did my first time here... thanks Trudy :)
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Alex whipped up the best creamy Tesora with honey I’ve ever tasted. And I’d say I’ve had at least 200 tesoras
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"Great selection of coffees and teas, good place to do some work on your laptop. Just a little pricey."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"this is where they do the real thing. Pour through per cup. We have Phil at work and it is really nice, but not like this. It's all in how you do it."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Nice little place. Thank you whoever keeps taking my dumb order of hot water everytime I'm on break

Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Best cup of drip coffee around. Don’t embarrass yourself asking for espresso drinks here. Not happening.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"A little on the expensive side but otherwise fantastic, great coffee, good service, nice selection of pastries"
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"It feels like there is a unannounced competition going on in the San Francisco to be more pretentious than the next guy. This is also ran in that competition. As a coffee shop, it is miserable."
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Exceptionally below average. There’s nothing special about their coffee. I should have gone to McDonald’s.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Impeccable service..even better coffee..I ordered the  tesora creamy and sweet with a sprig of mint.
Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,Rather good Philz with greenery in it's courtyard.

Philz Coffee,1775 17th St,"The coffee I got was kinda cold the young lady Courtney Brown, the dirty trash cans through the dining area. I was in the chair when she Brong the second one in, and she tries to squeeze the dirty trashcan in between me and a chair and couldn’t so then she said excuse me. Then she has the water container with a dirty trashcan. They have a good customer service over all"
