Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Traveling from out of state. Came here every morning to try their different types of toast. So beautiful and tasty. Food came out quickly and coffees were perfect.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Working around Mazarin cafe, I always wanted to try their Toast! I finally got to try it last week. I ordered the fresh fruit & ricotta toast and I love it, especially the lemon zest on top of it. The price is a little high for a toast, but it tastes great so I will definitely come back to buy it again."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Such a cute little spot! Visiting from out of town and loved it! Fig and Ricotta Toast, Avocado Toast, Pour Over Green Tea, Cappuccino with Almond Milk All amazing delicious!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Service was friendly. Coffee and food good. Mocha especially excellent. Prices on the high side but good quality.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Coffee and service was good here. We came here as it looked like they had great reviews and they opened early. Great nitro and grilled bacon sandwich pictured.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Excellent coffee and nice people, the avocado toast was good too and the club sandwich was one of the best I’ve EVER had!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Absolutely delicious coffee and food. Great presentation and atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Coffee was high quality, roasted very well, there was no bitterness."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Loved the beet hummus!  Wish there was drip decaf coffee, but they make me a great decaf americano instead!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I have been to San Francisco twice since 2019 and have always tried to make at least one visit to have their amazing breakfast toasts. This time I had a ham, egg and cheese toast with an oat milk latte. And I was not let down: fresh bread and a terrific balance of flavors. Even the latte was amazing! Whatever espresso they use went well with the smooth, oat milk. Definitely worth a visit. If you are an early riser, even better and sit outside."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I had a delightful experience with the tea at Mazarine Coffee, where they offer an exceptional drip over tea preparation. The warm ambiance, knowledgeable staff, and careful attention to detail made the tea-making process a pleasure to watch. Each cup of tea was made with genuine care, and the flavors were perfectly balanced, leaving me with a newfound appreciation for the art of tea-making."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,$5.75 nitro cold brew $6.5 iced latte $11.5 fresh fruits and ricotta Free wifi  The fresh fruit and ricotta toast was interesting with sea salt and black pepper on it. Friendly staff and good service :)
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great location, amazing service, and high-quality food and coffee. I appreciate the attention they pay to crafting their coffee beverages. Nothing worse that bad tasting coffee. Mazarine does a great job at making delicious coffee.  The food is a little pricy, but what you get tastes great, so it’s a small downside."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"In town for a conference, I was looking for a lowkey place to work, ideally that had decent coffee, but mostly that was not super crowded and had a good vibe. Here you get both! Really was surprised to even find a laid back coffee shop that had space to work in such a bustling city. Wish they had more outlets, but not charging my computer was my b anyway. Recommend!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,One of my go to places on Market street for great coffee and breakfast. If you are after something to eat I definitely recommend the avocado sandwich.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Nice spot for a quick stop. Warm and clean space with tables inside and out. Tasty and high quality food but small portions. Coffe and mocha were not good at all. Not friendly/polite staff. They can do much better.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Lovely place, great coffee and toasts!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Pretty solid espresso: good taste and a medium roast. With great food. Atmosphere is pretty busy, very finance district, may need to eat standing."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Definitely my kind of coffee shop!! This was BEST TOAST I’ve ever had in a long time! The tomato, ricotta and basil toast was amazing. I was basic and ordered a vanilla latte but man it was still so good 😫 …"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,toasts were amazing! lots of room to sit inside.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice, warm & welcoming coffee shop that is open early for early birds who can't live without breakfast. The matcha was rich & creamy, full of flavor, the way I like it. The cappuccino was also good. The avocado toast, grilled cheese,  croissant & other pastries were all satisfying."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Been coming to Mazarine for coffee, weekly, for a few years now and it never disappoints.  The baristas are very precise (they measure everything) to make sure the coffee comes out perfectly each time. The level of care they put into each drink makes this one of the most consistently good coffeeshops in SF. It’s also located in a great location, in the heart of the city. I strongly recommend the cortado 🙌🏽"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,One of the best places in San Francisco for Avocado Toasts! Cozy in- and outdoor seating. Coffee is super delicious. Definitely try the homemade salted grapefruit lemonade!  Suggestion: Add some tomatoes to the avocado toast - super yummy!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee. They had an amazing fig jam and ricotta toast
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The queue out of the door says all you need to know. Great coffee (espresso), choice of milks including oat. I had the avocado and beet hummus on toast, well presented and tasted very fresh.Even though it can be a jostle for tables there seems to be a steady flow. If their are two of you, send one person to grab a table while the other orders."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Good coffee. We had coffee and my wife ordered the overnight oats for breakfast. Fast service and everything looked nice. Toasts and sandwiches also looked good
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Coffee is good but a bit overpriced. Music was a little too loud.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Couple of good vegan options, and they were happy to make my beetroot hummus toast without the cheese. Coffee is awesome, the pour over is especially good. Friendly staff, order and pay at the counter, nab a seat when you can, then they’ll call your name to go up and pick up your order.  It’s appreciated when you take your plates and mugs back up to the countertop after you finish."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"We visited the place on Friday morning and it was pretty busy but the line was going quick. We ordered a latte, a Golden Yunnan tea, an egg & avocado toast and a country breakfast. Gluten free toast is available as well. Everything was very flavorful and fresh. They also have seating outside if anyone wants."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Dark roast only. Highly skilled barrister though.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I tried fig and ricotta and this is my first time trying this combination and I really like it. my friend ordered hummus & avocado. The place is okay but I would come for the toasts 😋
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I'm a sucker for good coffee place. They have great coffee selection and veriety. From special blends to balance the taste to single origins to get that full of flavor sip and contemplate the scenery and imagination of the country that grows these beans. Their avocado taste is nice however I didn't like it because it wasn't purely an avocado toast.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Excellent food. The avocado on toast was yum. Service was fast and there is plenty of space to sit. Clean bathrooms...they have a book wallpaper which was fun to look at. The drip coffee wasn't too good though.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"So you woke up in SanFran.. and want a chic cafe to start your morning with really high grade coffee and breakfast food and pastries. This is when you head over to Mazarine, easy walking distance from most downtown hotels. Fantastic menu and smooth coffee choices. Simple, comfortable atmosphere... great people watching as locals come and go at the start of their day. Had the Gibraltar for coffee and the fig + ricotta toast.. it was a flavor fest in my mouth. Definitely will be recreating it at home. No Wifi.. debate-able whether that’s a good thing or not. In any case, would not deter me to go back and try some of the other foods people around me were having.. egg toasts, fresh croissants, something with yummy salmon in it.. let’s say my eyes were eating it all up!  Start your day right! start your day with a positive thought or image.. and yes good coffee does help!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Pricing on the higher scale but good atmosphere and extensive toast menu. And the sous vide egg was on point. Grilled cheese seems to be a popular option too. The store can get busy later in the day.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,This place is gorgeous inside and has nice outside seating. It’s on Market st. which is truly disgusting but they keep the outside clean so it’s not so bad. Sit inside in the back to work/study or in front for sunny window seating. I got the salmon toast and an Arnold Palmer. Both delicious. The toast is really filling and mostly healthy.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"If you're a coffee enthusiast, you have to check out this shop. They serve some of the best pour-over coffee I've ever tasted, and their knowledge and passion for coffee is evident in every cup."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,More fast casual then dine in breakfast. Toast and over nights are nothing to write home about. But the ingredients  are fresh and good for a quick bite if your around!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The drip coffee was too ""bright""  for me. The cash teller was all business. The space seemed nice."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I went there for the 1st time today. The chai is made onsite and tasted excellent. The milk oatmilk was unsweetened. There are many options for pour overs and other coffee drinks. I  will return for coffee and something to eat from there ample menu.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice outdoor seating if you like to see people walking outside. Smaller portion than normal. More coffee options to choose from, but wasn't that amazed by my pour over coffee."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Awesome coffee place, very busy and the code is quite expensive. But it you get a place to sit it's quite good. Very close to public transit and right at the heart of market! Tons of power outlets, fun place to work remotely on your laptop or for reading a book. Not too quiet, not too noisy."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I got to this coffee place after looking for a third wave coffee place. I love the fact it does not part of a coffee chain. The cold brew coffee is one of the best I tasted. The food is also vert good. Two thing to take in consideration are long queue during coffee “rush hours” and the limited sitting. Will  defiantly come again
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"My colleague spent $26 for a hot tea and a chicken salad that contained barely any chicken. Overall ok spot (lots of seating) and priciness is to be expected for the location (and my $15 ham and egg toast was tasty at least), but the salad should have more than a few pieces of chicken at that price point."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,We came here almost every day of our trip.  This place is excellent and has great food as well. Well worth the but if a wait to get your handcrafted coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Not bad! I did think the food options were overpriced but the drinks are pretty standard. I had a latte and the pain au ciocolate (chocolate croissant). Both were decent, but nothing special. The cashier did not offer to warm the croissant so it was tough and tasted a bit stale. The latte was silky and creamy and the coffee taste was mild. Not bitter at all, even without any added sugar, and it came in a huge bowl-like mug which I really liked! There is NO wifi, and the #SFWiFi did not work at this cafe, so I had to gulp down my massive latte and leave quickly so I could find a place to work. Overall it is a quaint cafe with good seating and ambiance. Most folks sitting in were conversing in pairs. It seems like a great place for a coffee date or informal meeting!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"After going to as many coffee shops as I can find, this one takes the top spot. The baristas are on point here, serving up quality and precision brewed coffee while maintaining friendly service. The espresso is hands down the best and is very consistent in quality."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The place is really noce and cozy, the staff are friendly and the food is amazing i had the beet hummus, Avocado and Ricotta cheese toast it was so yummy.Also the vanilla Latte they make is very special❤️❤️"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Nice little coffee shop.  I only ordered an espresso to go.  It is very smooth.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Outstanding. Drinks were spot on and I came back here more than once while here for a conference. Toast was delicious, albeit a bit pricey, but hey, it’s San Fransisco. A good thing going here, and the daily line to the counter proved it."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I came here for brunch and it was exactly what I wanted. The avocado and egg toast was fantastic with the sous vide eggs perfectly cooked so that it's not completely cooked but also not runny. I got an iced hot chocolate (requested), and it was equally refreshing and tasty. It does get crowded so I got mine to-go just in case, but their for-here dinnerware is simple and fitting for a down to earth meal :)"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Came in for a quick takeout coffee. The layout of the coffee shop was pretty confusing, wasn’t sure where to stand in line to order. Staff were ok, but quite disoriented and not in the “morning rush” mode. I was the only one in line and it took 10 min to get my cup. There were no cardboard holders so I had to bunch up napkins to prevent burning my fingertips. The coffee quality was 4 star, creamy organic milk, but one star off for lacking the richness of the roast. Didn’t really have that fragrance of strong coffee. Food coming out looked quite good, thick toast and eggs."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good coffee. Yummy breakfast! Def try the avocado toast, eggs & avocado toast and the tomato ricotta boil toast ! Def going back there on visiting sfo."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Cute little coffee shop on market street.  I would highly recommend their lox toast and latte. You can even get it on gluten free bread for an extra 1.50.  Gets a bit busy in the morning so snag a seat after you order. The drinks and food comes out fairly quickly.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Had a delicious latte and healthy, tasty lentil and avocado bowl in the sunshine on their little patio. Delightful!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Cosy place with great coffee and good variety of toasts. Good place to just sit and chill for a while. Thought I’d still be hungry after one toast but it was actually just nice.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Have to stop by Mazarine if I'm in the area. Very creative breakfast items and good staff.  Gets my vote for best avocado toast and introduced me to watermelon radishes.  Small space so sometimes seats are tough to find but sometimes nice to linger on smallish patio overlooking Market St. sea of humanity.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Their Gibraltar is a must must try. It's like a cortado but less on the intense/bitter side.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Brian is my FAVE! Coffee? Incredible! Avocado toast? Phenomenal!! I love...EVERYTHING!! This place ROCKS!!!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Going in for a quick bite and coffee, I was pleasantly surprised. Light fare - a variety of delicious toast and vegetarian options. Good espresso with beautiful latte art. You’ll be amazed."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Loved this gem of a place! Great coffee and excellent food, located in a great area!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Quite expensive but undoubtedly good quality. I ordered the Egg & Avocado toast for $11, egg was pretty runny but definitely very tasty."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Tomato toast was quite delicious, wouldn't recommend the beetroot hummus. People talk about the toast but it seems expensive and not very filling. Had a sparkling cucumber limeade that was very refreshing. Coffee is ok, wouldn't line up for it. Had to bus own table."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Ordered a latte and the avo toast. Coffee was too hot it almost burned my tongue. So disappointed as I read many great reviews about this cafe so at least I though that they’d be able to make the coffee right.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Colorful dishes and friendly staff, really good place for overall review however I have some comments. I prefer avocado in small cuts to put on top of whole sandwich not big like this. The coffee is ok and nothing special."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Food is very expensive and ok. Coffee and ambience is good.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Beet hummus toast was so yummy! was coffee too! Fyi, There is no wifi here and I expected beautiful latte art tho.. but it’ fine. I’ll come back to try other menus"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Best coffee and absolutely love the bread they use for their toasts. Light meals, not too heavy."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"my new fav place for coffee and toast and i meant good drip coffee and scrumptious toast even they scream CALORIESSSSS. but seriously, the baristas are very serious about their coffee craft"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice ambience. Great coffee. Tried their waffle recently, was good. The expresso is decently flavored. Been going to this place for a few months. Would recommend at least a visit for coffee. Also try some of the food."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"People say you can’t get food coffee in the states.. where are they going? Starbucks?  This place does a solid flat white (with soy for any of you aussies) and a delicious selection of eats and pastries to go with. I had the beatroot, hummus, avo and what I think was hard ricotta. Yum all the way to the bay."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great lunch spot! Both the salads and the sandwiches were fresh, tasty, and well made. The coffee is excellent too."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Very kind staff here. I came on a Friday afternoon and needed to charge my phone. This coffee shop although in a hectic location is rather peaceful! It is great for working or reading. I ordered a hot chocolate which was pretty much the price of a latte and it was delicious, not too sweet or overwhelmingly chocolatey. They even made it with almond milk."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This place is good, worth the price compared to other places around, mmmmm… not so much. Worth a visit but save the cash."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Delicious food and good ambient, friendly staff. One bad think: They don't accept $50 notes. Recommended!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Delicious drip coffee, smooth and balanced. I would highly recommend Mazarine Coffee. The food is good as well, I ordered avocado toast with egg, and it was well done with fresh ingredients. Also had other dishes and all were very good. Much appreciated the terracotta dishes and being served my coffee in real mugs."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee. The Yogurt and oatmeal are very good.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee, we finally found a perfect flat white and cappuccino in SF. The place also has a great vibe, glad we passed by!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Enjoyed the Gilbraltar Espresso. Wasn't the delicious nor distinct. The place was impressively calm and quiet. The service was smiley and easy going. The place is quite unusual for its cleanliness and elegance for its location on the urine-soaked Market Street
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good food and drink. Little pricey for what you get, but not unreasonable for the city. No wifi available, which is odd given it's a coffee shop and really ought to have wifi. I had the tomato/basil to sit and chia seed with lemonade... very tasty!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Nice Americano and avocado toast
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Lovely coffee shop. A bit tight and crowded to work from here but they have great coffee and a nice menu. Several toast / bunch options available. I enjoyed everything I had.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,A great place to stop for coffee and light food. The food is fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is nice and the stuff are friendly. Highly Recommended.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Fig toast, Tomato&basil toast and Raf  Best!❤️❤️❤️  Also very nice and kind"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee, Flat white how it should be and the most smiling waitress in whole San Francisco, when you enter you know which one is that ;-) thanks for the amazing morning!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Delicious nitro and fig toast, but had a bag stolen here. It’s close to the tenderloin area so be careful."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Serving up most excellent coffee expertly prepared by friendly baristas and hearty toast you must eat with a fork and a knife. They play the best music and the coffee was killer, but I wouldn't go back for the toast."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice menu for breakfast.  I had the egg and avocado on toast and it was pretty awesome.  The staff was friendly, fast and efficient.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for an early morning coffee and breakfast option"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Nice coffee shop at downtown to work with your laptop. Their latte was so good too
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Honestly, this is a top shelf coffee establishment.  I had a pourover of one of their Onyx coffees and it was nigh perfectly executed.  I had an orange chocolate scone to go with it that was beautiful and good but not great.  The space is welcoming and has plenty of room for a work meeting or some time spent working away on your laptop.  There's even a small patio area if you prefer outside seating.  The service was effective and friendly.  Would strongly recommend to anyone in the area!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"On my short trip to San Francisco I came here twice right before work. They're coffee is pretty good and I got a cold brew at the next time I got a chai latte I definitely prefer the cold brew a little bit more than the chai latte.  I also got a plain croissant, which I thought was OK, but nothing special. This place is definitely a great spot to get your daily coffee fix and maybe a piece for yourself. However, I don't think it is a place worth planning around on a café/bakery tour  Alice C.Elite 2022 San Francisco, CA 431490603 11/6/2022 4 check-ins While it seems to be on the pricey side ($6 for an espresso at least!), Mazarine is a great alternative to the ubiquitous Blue Bottle coffee that you find all over the city. The coffee (espresso) is delicious, the baristas are very friendly, and on top of that, they actually have a full menu of toasts and other savory items so you can get breakfast or lunch here easily.  On the price again: it seems steep but to be absolutely honest, it is comparable to their main competitors like Blue Bottle or Caffe Central. Toast at $12 a piece is actually quite average around the Bay Area and I've even seen those prices in the Midwest... so don't let that stop you. Just understand that everything is expensive now.  Mazarine is quite close to Moscone center, which makes it a great place to stop by before your conferences. But it also can get slammed at certain times in the day -- or when one of the aforementioned conferences is happening. Just be prepared, or order online ahead of time, and if they are too busy, there's always the Blue Bottle down the street.  Meryl S.Elite 2022 Parkside, San Francisco, CA 2372839 9/16/2022 1 photo This is place is such a great spot to get some work done! It has wi-fi sand outlets and lots of tables to sit at. At times it can get very loud so bring some headphones if you are trying to concentrate.  The food here was really good and came in a timely manner! The drinks here are good but nothing too special! Definitely you can tell the baristas are making the espresso right!  I would say overall this a great place but the person who was taking my order seemed annoyed and wanted to rush me.  Ham, Egg, & Cheese Toast Chicken Club  Hannah P.Elite 2022 Raleigh, NC 29246571 10/23/2022 1 photo1 check-in Very large and spacious breakfast spot! Tons of food options with toasts both sweet and savory. I opted for the avocado toast which was very unique and unlike any I'd had. I enjoyed it but found the bread to be very crusty and a bit difficult to eat. I also got a chai latte that was both beautiful to look at and tasted amazing. One of the better chais I've had lately! I'd definitely return here to try a different toast.  Avocado Toast and Chai Latte"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The staff here are fantastic, but they are understaffed almost every single morning. The owners should hire additional people during peak hours."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Very nice place for your breakfast. You have a nice menu of toasts, salads and sandwiches and the coffee is exceptionally good. There are a couple of tables in front with a lot of sun over most times of the day."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Delightful modern, specialty coffee paired with really wonderful food. The savory toasts were memorable. Yes, I mean Avocado Toast. The staff clearly enjoys working here and excelling at their craft."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee and eggs & avocado toast but a bit on pricey side.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Friendly staff, pleasant interior and atmosphere and, most important, delicious coffee and food.  I will certainly return on my next visit to SF."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Their coffee is really unique and offers a big competition to the Starbucks near by. I went there because a friend recommended it and I really liked it personally. The coffee I got was a nitro cold brew. Now this was way too strong for me, so I had to dilute it, but for someone that likes pure strong coffee, this is for you."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Coffee was delicious and the coffee shop was cute. They have a good variety of breakfast toasts. unfortunately only with sousvide eggs available, mine were quittttte soft/ see through egg white and I left most of it on the plate."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Chicken + bacon + avocado toast is soooo nice. The sour sauce on it is tasty.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Awesome fusion based breakfast and brunch cafe. Unique to San Francisco. Easy to get to via Bart. by
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good chai latte, clean atmosphere, friendly-enough service ... limited seating but they do manage to keep the riff-raff out. Good food!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"They only serve nitro if you’re looking for iced coffee. I usually don’t care for nitro cold brew but it is actually quite good here. Great lunch options for a quick bite, but be prepared to spend $15 on a sandwich."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"If Maserati was spelled different, and if this place was a car, it would be a MAZARati. Because the food is fast! (If 'fast' meant 'really good')."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great Coffee, Smiling staff, swift service! Just had a delicious Chai Latte here and thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The takeaway coffee (triple shot flat white) was solid but definitely not worth a 10 minute wait and the USD7 (AUD9 😯) asking price. …
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The lady preparing hot drinks yelled at a colleague when he asked a question. We found it quite rude. Food and coffee were ok, nothing stellar. Left us wanting more so we went to a cafe down the street and were pleasantly surprised."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Delicious toast and cappuccino, can't go wrong! Great local spot, eat and shop local rather than Nestlé owned blue bottle"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Asked them to make me a long black [120ml hot water with espresso in after] and it was spot on. Coffee had great taste and depth of flavour. 100% would recommend this coffee shop.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Small footprint with limited seating, but trendy coffee shop. Mix of small and large tables with lots of accesible outlets, and a few patio tables. Enjoyed the Nitro Cold Brew."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Cappuccino and latte for take out. Taste ok but not great
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The coffee was really good and I also enjoyed their waffle and berry sauce. Definitely trying to get back before our trip ends!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Very cozy place I spent a rainy afternoon there and had very nice coffee
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Best coffee (and toast) in town. Don't miss this perfect breakfast place here in SF.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I stop by whenever I'm in town for amazing coffee and a nice spot to sit and recoop. Though I hate idea of artisanal toast (come on guys, it's $9 bread), I gotta admit it's delicious"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Amazing toast options. Coffee was superb and service was friendly. Can't wait to go back
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Loved the ambience and the coffee. Good location and welcoming staff. Service was quick and coffee was unique and rightly done.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Really good coffee shop but the only drawback is that they don’t provide WiFi. However I still want to give them a five star since their overnight oat and their sandwich are amazingly good! Worth a try.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Have been twice a day since arriving in SF. Fantastic coffee, great food. Particularly the morning oats and fresh fruit bowl for breakfast."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great Ice Latte but it doesn't hurt to smile 😉
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I used to really enjoy coming here before work but wow has this place gone downhill, unfortunately.  Coffee is SO expensive- I’m happy to pay more for a great coffee but not only did I wait a really long time, my coffee was not hot at all and the espresso tasted burnt. It was barely lukewarm at best which I didn’t realize until I was already down the block.  I was really excited to go back here, sad to be disappointed with somewhere I used to like."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Trendy (but delicious) toasts, good coffee, energetic vibe. Worth the wait."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Good coffee. I’ve heard avocado on toast is good too but haven’t tried myself. Can sometimes be quite a wait
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Nice and small coffee shop in heart of SF. Enjoyed Macchiato with double chocolate banana muffin. Had a  great experience!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good coffee, but a bit pricey (would be 5 star review if a tiny cup of coffee would cost less than $4.5)"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"More than just espresso blends, they offer a single origin choice. Latte tasty as well."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,First time visit to this coffee shop. Cashier was very nice. Good coffee. Their toasts were delicious. Loved the sousvide egg on mine.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Terrific spot! Stumbled on for a coffee and avocado toast. Coffee was delicious. I did not notice on the menu that the toast had goat cheese on it, and found out only after taking a bite. Despite it totally being my bad (all components are described clearly on the menu), they voluntarily opted to give me a new toast, no cheese, no charge and no questions asked. The toast was absolutely delicious too. Will come again."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"A little pricey, but good espresso style coffee. Usually pretty busy, but you might be able to get a seat."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I'm a huge coffee fan and can be hard to please. I was not disappointed in Mazarine! Beautiful little shop with great coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I had the smoked salmon toast. It was really good. If there was anything I could improve was to reduce the cream cheese spread just slightly and more evenly. I also got an iced tea it's very refreshing and they did properly without sugar so you can sweeten it to your own liking.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The coffee shop ambiance is really nice. Seating is good too. The mocha I ordered used dandelion chocolate but the coffee tasted more chocolaty. The prices are on expensive side, plus there is no wifi."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Mazarine Coffee is your go-to café for coffee drinks and small bites near union square.  I had a very positive experience with all the food and beverages ordered by my group.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Went there in early morning and staff looked so sleepy. Toast is soso and actually not worth of that price. The only good thing is the coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Very popular but also very slow. You Might not want to go here if you just need to grab a quick beverage.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,This was a really cool coffee shop and very chill! Perfect for a smooth espresso.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice service, great food. A little bit crowded though."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Quite good espresso, well made and good crema, strong and a little bitter, but a great option in San Francisco."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Best coffee place to work in SF (that I've been to thus far)
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Very cute lil cafe by the market street :)
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Excellent (but pricey) coffee with a nice atmosphere.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Understaffed, so they refuse to make espresso drinks.  Yet somehow the eggs are cold despite the wait.  Doesn't matter because the pastries are dreadful anyway, so it's a tourist trap even on a good day."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Terrible Americano coffee, slightly better than hot dishwater."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The best coffee I had in San Francisco. Try their drip! It’s fantastic. Vibe is on point. Perfect spot for a quick morning brew.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Amazing coffee!!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"My friend introduced me to this cute and lovely coffee spot in SF. The Cold Brew Coffee is absolutely the best! It's so smooth, strong and refreshing. They also have different types of savory and sweet toast available.We tried a savory and sweet toast. The Avocado and Egg toast was really good! It was well balanced between the avocado slices and 2 sous vide eggs. This was my favorite of the two toasts."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Good for breakfast/brunch but not an ideal cafe to work on laptops
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Horrible tastes, overpriced There was only one similarity to iced tea, and that was the bitterness.  Poached eggs fly over smooshy toast  There were a couple of tables outside with the smell of worse public bathrooms"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Nice hip cafe with a wide selection of avocado toast and sandwiches. There was a bit of a line and little seating but we were able to find a spot outside. The coffee was great and the chicken club sandwich was the best i ever had. My wife had the beet hummus avocado toast which she quite enjoyed.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great food, they have tasty toasts for meals."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Mazarine Coffee = Quintessential San Francisco.  As I'm saying this, I'm sure plenty of people will come to argue saying that real SF can only be represented by establishments in the Castro, or that establishments themselves, are not real SF. In my experience as both a bay area resident and as an SF tourist, Mazarine Coffee checks off all of the boxes of what I'd expect for a trendy cafe that's in a high traffic location. The food/ drink offerings are plentiful, the staff is diverse and friendly, and the prices aren't too bad!  Mazarine has plenty of nice drink options, both for the coffee lovers among us, as well as those of us who are more coffee averse (try the limeade, it's surprisingly refreshing). I really wish I was a local to try more of their options, but from all I've heard, the menu is well put together.  Additionally, the toast options are to die for. Before I move on, let me say that I am not normally a toast person. When my friend told me that Mazarine Coffee was known for its toasts, I was (not so) silently hoping that he meant french toasts. However, the savory toasts are fantastic. I got the Bacon, Egg, and Avocado toast, and it's definitely worth the price. It's a good amount of food without making you feel stuffed/ like you have to take half home, but also manages to pack a good punch of flavor into a limited space.  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Mazarine Coffee, I don't think you'll regret it!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Excellent coffee and tea. Staff were super friendly and we really enjoyed our breakfast as well. I had the overnight oats and my wife had the fig & ricotta toast.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Food is really good.  I especially liked the pickled veg garnish.  Comes out relatively quickly.  You can tell they use quality ingredients.  Service is friendly.  Only con is finding a seat can be tricky during the lunch rush.  Might have to share a table with someone else, which I know is still catching on here in the states, but who knows, you might make a new friend."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee place and cafe. I had their rotating pour over coffee and a slice of their toast with tomato, ricotta, and pesto. The toast was excellent, with a large thick piece of bread and plenty of topping. Both times I visited (8am Monday and 10am Saturday) the place was nearly full, with seating for 1-2 available by the time my order was ready."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The coffee is great and the staff polite. I've never had the food, but it is beautiful and pricey. I'd fault the place for the cost, but it's not overly marked up considering it is in prime market retail space and rent isn't cheap.  This place often has long lines, and cramped tables where laptop workers spread out to fill the minimal space. I've come here twice now for a coffee chat, and after waiting for 5-15 minutes, we simply have to give up and go elsewhere. Somewhat of a pain if you've ordered to dine in. Ultimately this is simply a testament to this place's success, so don't skip it simply because you won't get to sit down.  Come to grab your beverage to go, and you will not be disappointed!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great espresso, careful pourovers too. Great breakfasts."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,A great spot on the weekend to have breakfast! Cool vibe. Great avo toast!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Amazing avocado toast with poached eggs! I hope you enjoy runny yolk!  The coffee here is also top notch. And to top it all off, the service is impeccable. They won't bring your food or drinks to your table but when you're ordering, they are super friendly and nice and don't rush you even though there's a long line behind you.  Highly recommend this coffee shop"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Coffee was well made and delicious. The cappuccino was a bit big (maybe almost 8oz milk), and there is no wifi. I was lucky and didn't have to wait (at 7:15). By 7:45 there was a line of commuters. The snacks looked amazing and artistic, but I didn't have any. Would definitely go again."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great spot in a central SF location.   But Barista takes breaks so no espresso drinks when that happens.   Update:  absolutely PERFECT Latte!!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Excellent coffee and excellent food! This great location has a good amount of seating inside, providing you with time to sit and enjoy their food. The menu is straightforward, with a good amount of options. It's well maintained inside, with nicely designed furniture. WiFi is available, so you will see people on their computers enjoying their coffee. A good coffee shop to come to, have a drink, chow, and chat with friends!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Way overpriced. Ok food. Came here a couple times to meet with friends. Hard to find seats.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"My friend had the beet hummus & avocado toast and i had the salmon toast with Latte. The toast was very thick and a bit stiff, need a bit pressure to slice it off. But not too harsh for chewing. The slightly salty salmon serve a good balance with the toast. One toast is just something you would expect from a cafe to fulfill your stomach. The beet hummus & avocado toast were not as flavorful as salmon toast. It is visual enjoyable and extremely healthy. The beet hummus is fresh and similar to what you can get from “berkeley bowl market”.  The latte was decent but the design of the mug and saucer is well-considered and functional. (The saucer is in the shape of oval corresponding to the handle of the mug). The location is right on the most busiest street, easy to find. Good vibes, can be hard to find seat during busy hours. There is a comfortable distance away from the crowds to make you feel not interrupted (private space) enjoying your favorites."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,This coffee is maybe the best cup I’ve ever had. Perfectly balanced and brewed... just got a regular drip to go. Thought the size was a little small but the amount of caffeine it punches is the same as a too-legit-to-quit cold brew. Staff is super nice and helpful. I only got the to go coffee so I have no clue about anything else :-)
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"A place for a to-go or a quick bite right off the Market Street.  A creative range of fare and friendly staff, but the space is smallish and doesn't feel inviting. Definitely not a place to work - it's too busy and crowded."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Good good good coffee place  We really enjoyed going there for specialty coffee and weren’t disappointed at all.  They build awesome espresso and a great flat white.  Some bites to eat are available as well.  Will come back again for sure!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Friendly staff. I had an ice coffee on a hot sunny day. It was super yummy and was exactly what I needed to cool off. Nice outdoor seating area. Indoors tables were a bit too close for my comfort. Nevertheless a great little cafe.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,I really loved the food and the coffee. Prices are ok and they are really quick.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Pick a “toast”, any toast, they’re all delicious.  Espresso based drinks are as good as it gets."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great avocado toast and overnight oats. Oats weren't too sweet, had a nice consistency and good portion. Drip coffee was also good.  Early at around 8:00am there was no wait and no problem finding a table."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Very good food but it's a shame they only do runny eggs and no other way....
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"A slightly confused experience, but good coffee at the end of it. Ordering in this place doesn't seem to work - they don't always take your name but expect to call it out when your coffee is ready. Perhaps it was teething problems with a new member of staff, but given how much this place loves itself (clue: a lot!) I'm have thought they'd be a bit more on the ball. But the coffee is great, and breakfast toasts utterly delicious!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Very good espresso -- almost great, so like a great minus. The staff is friendly. The quality of the espresso may depend on who is working the machine. There is a fairly good breakfast menu, but I only had some pastries, which were good."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"One of the best coffee shops in Union Square with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The coffee is fantastic. Don't be deterred by a sometimes long line, it moves fast. The avocado and poached eggs on toast looks amazing and something I would love to try. All of the Aussies at work go to Mazarine (including me!)"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This is a calm and relaxing cafe in the heart of Downtown San Francisco. Their carry very good quality and delicious coffee here. They're spacious with a good amount of seats and table for you seat back with your book, laptop and just enjoy their good coffee and service."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Ideal coffee shop one could possibly visit!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The best capuccino in San Francisco!!!! Every day!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"My friend and I checked this place out and enjoyed the toast options for breakfast. I find a lot of the breakfast options heavy so this is a nice alternative. I had the raspberry nutella, which was good, but was more heavy on nutella. The egg and avocado was pretty yummy. Drinks were good too. Nice location right on Market seat with outdoor seating available. Do check it out!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The ricota and tomate toast is really nice. Enjoy the almond milk with coffee.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Only 16 months in and Mazarine Coffee place is making coffee addicts queue up every morning to get a sip of their favourite shot.  If you're ever in San Francisco you have to try it. Whether you walk by or make a specific stroll down Market street just for that, you won't be disappointed. Great atmosphere in these minimalist yet robust interiors, offering delicious toasties and absolutely great coffee.  Ask for the available flavours!  P.S. Avocado poached eggs with some ham on the side is always a great choice"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice interior, great sandwiches and baked goods. Wouldn't go here for coffee though. Ordered a flat white with a double shot of their Ethiopian - after first not really getting the concept of 'Flat White' I got told all their coffees get served flat white style (what?), I got surprised with a (mediocre) espresso as black as the cashier's soul who couldn't tell me where the white in that is either. It was too busy to really discuss this any further, and expensive."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee shop..I will be back.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The coffee here is so good that you'll want to order an espresso just for the taste of it.  It had just the right amount of foam and sweetness to make me want another sip!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Essential accessories Get more from your Surface with accessories designed to enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow Summited Everest Into his i  own party leader's okh..
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great pourovers, but slightly pricey ($6). Espresso was well made as well."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good sandwiches, has power outlets and wifi, crowded but you can share a table. Fun people watching. So happy this place is still here and just as great and has weathered the pandemic!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,My favorite brunch place in San Francisco! perfect Avocado toast and the beet hummus is very good too. You sometimes have to wait a little for seating but you'll generally have something by the time your food is ready. :)
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Coffees are exceptional. Had the Gibraltar. Well balanced. Delicious
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,They Provide The Same According to our taste 🔥💕 …
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This is my 3rd time visiting San Francisco and my second time coming here. I love the toasts! I’ve only gotten the savory ones, because they are so good. The avocado toast with the radish is amazing. I got an iced chai latte and it wasn’t 99% milk like most places, it actually tasted like chai. Love this place!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great concept. Rotating roasters as pour-over options, and lots of good toast options. The two stars are for the disinterested/apathetic staff. Specialty coffee is an exciting and fascinating, relational industry, but here it seems like it’s just a job to them."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Food was delicious! Coffee was really good too. A little bit sad that they didn't have sweetener only sugar. And that I asked for a coffee with heavy cream but they gave me a coffee and directed me to get the heavy cream from the stand with the sugar, which wasn't heavy cream they only had half and half. But the taste was really good!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee  choice of milks including oat. I had the avocado and beet hummus on toast, well presented and tasted very fresh.Even though it can be a jostle for tables there seems to be a steady flow.Great place for a quick bite."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Enjoyed a shot of espresso and smoked salmon toast for breakfast. They have a variety of trendy toasts to satisfy different diets and tastes. I found the beet hummus toast to exemplify their style and ethos with its brilliant magenta color and detailed presentation, but I opted for the smoked salmon to sustain me for a hard day's work ahead. I found they chose presentation over practicality with this dish, since thin slices of cucumber would have worked better for flavor and experience, but the spears made for more dynamic visual impact. Regardless, I enjoyed it immensely."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"A busy cafe with great coffee. Pour over is highly recommended. If you come at a peak hour, reserve 30mins to get your coffee. Pan au Chocolate is also nice and they can heat up for you. The staff is friendly. Overall good experience. If your coffee is to go, the only cons is that they don't offer cup sleeve so remember to get some tissues to make your own sleeve."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The lag in receiving your beverage is long enough for warm food to become cold.  This is a standard SF speciality restaurant of which there are many, that believes decent food compensates for indifferent service.  The food and coffee are fine, the staff is precious and meeting your needs clearly interferes with other priorities.  I will generally pass on reviewing rather than pan a business.  The owners would do well to orient their staff toward meeting customers 1/2 way.  I understand and have observed obnoxious customers in the city that can make service jobs difficult, that said, indifferent staff doesn't make the situation better."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good coffee with interesting flavors, great toast (both sweet and savory varieties), decent service. Really packed though (had to wait a while to grab a table), and very overpriced for what it is. Fun to people-watch here."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee and super friendly service! I'm really glad they reopened. Try onenof their specialty drinks or their avo toast. Their pastries are also amazing.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"We were came to SF for a girls get together. My sister found this place on yelp.  We parked our car near Macy's.  We passed by so many Starbucks to get this restaurant. We ordered the egg and avocado sandwich which was good, walnut banana bread was delicious and cold nitro cold brew was of okay. Overall the place was great and I would definitely come back."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This is a nice cafe. I've only been a couple of times and both times did not involve coffee, unfortunately. On my last visit, I had the Ham, Egg, and Cheese Toast. I loved it. I was so hungry, I kind of wanted another one halfway through. The staff here is great too."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Incredible $11 avocado toast (really).  Love the space, it’s low key and you’ll leave feeling satisfied with coffee and breakfast."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good toast, but don't come when it's busy. Especially for coffee. It took 30+ minutes to get a latte after ordering it. I was able to get my toast and eat it before waiting an additional 15 minutes for my drink. Coffee was just ok. This was also when Google said it wasn't as busy as it usually is."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Ridiculously expensive and no Wi-Fi. It’s always crowded but I have no idea why. $7 for a latte, $9 for a single piece of toast with cheese, $15 for a low-quality sandwich (The prices listed on the Google Maps menu are not accurate). I received a gift card for this place but I would never spend my own money here. Staff is nice though, bathroom is clean."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Good independent coffee and friendly service ☕👌
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Supremely tasty ""toasts"", great coffee (try their Gibraltar or their Raf), and comfy seats.  Can get crowded, but worth the trip.  A nice and interesting place for breakfast (or probably lunch).  Steps from the Four Seasons hotel."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"My favorite coffee in SF. At one point they were always playing ambient electronic music, and that was the best. They have lovely cups that feel nice in your hands. No wifi, so you have to sit and look at your coffee or at other patrons."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Delicious coffee and filling Californian cafe food. Interior is charming but can get full and a little noisy. If your looking for a fun place to chat and rest from touring or shopping this is great. If you’re looking to study you might consider a quieter and less crowded location.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"For the longest time I didn't like this crowded and busy shop... But I started going here more and more, because they are the only thing open on the weekends. What I found out is the reason behind the crowds.  At first glance the menu is over priced and the coffee is alright.  After going a few more times I found that the healthy California cuisine is great for a light lunch and you can generally squeeze into a seat if you're by yourself.  For the area, I generally prefer iron horse coffee or better yet, walking a bit further and getting Chapel Hill Coffee, but neither are open on the weekends, so this is a more than adequate replacement."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Cool place with great coffee. Avocado toast is amazing!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Service is friendly and quick if you need a mid-day pick-me-up. The space is great for quick meetings and not for working all day (which is a plus). Prices are comparable to other over-priced coffees in San Francisco.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Excellent coffee, friendly service, charming interior; I often find myself here at least a few times a month. I loved this place! I'm a huge coffee shop aficionado and this place is now one of my favorites."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Good ambience and good taste.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Delicious! Great service and a pretty good amount of seating.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great drip coffee. We also ordered and enjoyed the overnight oats. Extremely busy inside on a Thursday morning, with a few ""campers"". Couldn't find seating inside. Will be back!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Really loved the calm atmosphere on a early Saturday morning in the city. My coffee and breakfast were fantastic. I order the thick cut toast with smoked salmon and avocado.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Space can get a little tight during the early morning bustle but the coffee and toasts make it worth it - the servings are generous and delicious. And if you can find a spot to post up with your laptop, it makes a great place to set up shop for a wfh day."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"What a great coffee shop, decent espresso, drips, and poor overs. My favorite nitro cold brew to date. It's full bodied and has slightly more nitro than you find other places. This smoothes it out further and it stays separated for longer. The food is absolutely awesome. I've had every avocado toast on the menu and can say that they are the best I've had period. I stop here every time I'm in the city. It can be quite busy but if you arrive before 8am you can usually find a table."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"So good, Came two days in a row."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Pretentious, unwelcoming, and just not customer friendly. Obvious irritation from staff upon ordering. They have no idea of coffee lingo such as blended and frappe. They don't make them, but instead of telling you they hand you a bitter hot coffee like it's what you ordered. When the cashier clearly said yes we have blended frappe beverages. I went to return it but was met with such a face I said nothing and just walked out."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Mazarine Coffee is located right on Market street, in the midst of a busy area of San Francisco. The staff are friendly and nice, the food is okay, and the coffee is good. The ambiance is nice for dropping in to get a cup of joe with a friend or colleague, but the space is always crowded, so be prepared to wait a long time for a table, or just grab your coffee to go. Not great for large crowds or for spending extended periods of time."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Food: OMG the hummus avocado toast is delicious!!! It comes with roasted beets and feta cheese and it's one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. There are other options as well but this was so good that I keep eating this one every time. Because of these options, this is a great place for vegetarians and you can ask to customize things if you are vegan. I also tried the Fig Jam & Ricotta toast but it was too sweet for me (it also comes with black pepper which I liked but some people may not).  Coffee: I only tried the Gibraltar but it was delicious! It was sharp and warm.  Ambiance/Space: this place is always packed! But you can get a table if you wait a few minutes. There's also an outside patio and free wi-fi. Washrooms are at the back of the cafe.  Accessibility: the entrance is wide enough for a wheelchair and tables are the right height. Washrooms are also accessible for those in wheelchairs."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Amazing coffee. The nitro cold brew is especially excellent. Haven't had too much of their food, but the Mazarine waffle is delicious. The pearl sugar really adds to it."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Mazarine was the first place to introduce me to nitro infused cold brew coffee and I'm forever grateful. The atmosphere is really nice and is perfect for taking your drink to go, or staying for a bit. The staff has always been really friendly and helpful if it is your first time there. Overall great experience."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Probably the best espresso in SF and very good milk drinks (Gibraltar, latte, etc.). Great pastries and toasts as well. Often crowded. Accessible entrance and step-free bathroom with width restrictions."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This is an AMAZING place for food and drinks... A lil pricey but WORTH it! They have a variety of ""toast"" covered in different yummy ingredients a MUST try! Especially ham & egg or avocado... Hard to choose one, bring a friend and share a couple different ones."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Mazarine is one of my go-to places for a good espresso. There's a rotating selection of different beans and roasters which keeps the variety interesting and fresh. So far, the few times I went, there were always two blends being pulled, a brighter cup and a more traditional darker (medium) blend. Both are great and should cover any espresso lover needing a fix."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice coffee shop, but the day I went was a little dirty than other coffee shops."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The best coffee in town.  Super chill location with soothing music, friendly staff, and fast internet.  It's a great place to meet up or do some writing .  The almond latte was the best I've had in San Francisco."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Nice interior and great espresso-based drinks (we had espresso and gibraltar). We didn't have time for food, but sandwiches looked delicious. 1 star off only because 14 minutes for 2 drinks is a bit longer than we expected being second in the line."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The coffee shop I hit whenever I'm in San Fran. Great coffee from local roasters with good avocado toast. They really need to take people's last name... Not unlikely that you'll get your order claimed by the wrong person!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee, nice toasts. The mochi muffin is great. I got one to go and after I had one bite I turned around and bought all the rest left in store and took it back to New York with me..."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee spot that also serves booze and food. I got the mocha and my friend got the drip. Both were amazing, and the space was chill and welcoming. Skip Starbucks and come here. Only downside was trying to find a place to sit in this cozy shop."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Classic SF coffee shop with classic SF prices. This has great food and a very warm atmosphere. Theres lots of seating but because it's a busy places it can be hard to find a spot. The staff are friendly and the coffee is 100%.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Located right on Market Street, not too far from the Westfield Mall. Nice selection of artesian, drip coffees and also sandwiches and munchies.  Nice vibe, but can get quite busy waiting for a seat. They have a small outdoor section, but that's better left when the weather is sunny."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"a little gem. excellent coffee and fabulous breakfast toasts with avocado, eggs and everything you wish for, beautifully presented. they also serve waffles & oat, sandwiches and salads but we didn't try."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great place for coffee. If you are looking for a single origin pour over or just a hot cup of coffee this place has it down. Food is very good as well. Though expensive their whole bean coffee is excellent. Broad selection.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,expensive but good caffe.. avocado toast good but small
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Excellent coffee and delicious breakfast, the staff was friendly"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Another happy Aussie having found great coffee close enough to Union Square whilst visiting San Francisco.  The coffee here was consistently great during our four day stay..thanks to the other Aussies who mentioned it in their reviews...most helpful.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The ricotta toasts are a nice breakfast but ultimately the coffee—both espresso and batch-brew—was just ok. If I were pressed for time and right there I would go back, but otherwise I probably wouldn’t go way out of my way for it."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Mint Tea...done. This stuff is so delicious there. My only issue is that this place is very busy and getting a seat can be difficult. Then, when you do get a seat, it's in the middle of a lot of people waiting for their orders. But the tea in the gorgeous ceramic mugs makes up for it."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Adorable coffee shop, with really really good coffee - right on market street."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great atmosphere and they have some great food selections here to enjoy with your coffee. My espresso was a touch tart the time I came here but their poached egg on toast made up for it.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"The latte I had has a special flavor you don't get from other cafe.  The frothy milk was perfect.  Not just foam on top of milk.  If the froth is done right, it's creamy and smooth and that's what I got.  It's little bit expensive for a slightly small cup of latte.  But the location is downtown.  So you can't really expect anything cheap."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Fantastic coffee and sandwiches! Great atmosphere!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"If you’re an Australian looking for decent coffee - it’s a must visit! Friendly staff, comfortable vibe with enough seating to not feel guilty about hanging out to work. Oh and did I mention the coffee is GREAT!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Made my latte pretty much like Australia n NZ.   Note, you'll need an extra shot if you want the strength to resemble Downunder espresso.  They weigh the coffee out and for some reason places that do that always serve weaker coffee....???!!   Anyway - an extra shot closely resembles decent coffee from back home"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good, but overpriced. But again, that's what hipster cafes offer anyways."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This the THE BEST place in the Bay Area, hands down.  Incredibly inviting environment, top-notch espresso, friendly staff.  The cafe's layout is very thoughtful with beautiful and modern decor that's not over-the-top.  The music volume level is low enough where you can have a conversation.  The ambiance is always warm and inviting amidst the hussle-and-bussle of the downtown/financial district area of Market.  Don't go anywhere else.  I live in the East Bay and always make a special trip to Mazarine whenever I go into the city, which is very conveniently located off the BART/MUNI.  Let's make sure we keep this place in business!!!!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Australians don't go here if you want a reasonably priced flat white. Somehow I ended up paying $11.60 AUD for a large. It was an okay coffee... 🤷
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good coffee, awful pastries. I got Danish with barely any cheese on it. My fiance threw out half of her waffle that neither one of us could eat. Giving 4 stars for coffee, 1 star for pastries."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Setting up a pop-up down the street and every morning we come in with a big order. Every morning the food is delicious, made quickly, and the staff are so nice and accommodating. Really lovely experience every time!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Easily an amazing breakfast and the nitro cold brew is so tasty and smooth
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great little spot, probably the best in the area for a solid pour over coffee and breakfast. I was here for a week for a conference and tried everything within a 10 or so minute walk from near Moscone. This was the best, even when I returned at the other end of the week."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee. Great breakfast.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"sure it looks swanky and fru-fru from outside but its a little too high on itself considering the food.  I know..its a coffee shop, but they big up these ""toasts"" like they are the best thing since eggs benedict.  Well let me tell you...they are not.  The toast was dry and burnt, not a single drop of butter ever touched my lips and the eggs on top were barely even heated through.  All this deliciousness can be your for like 10 bucks!  This one was a tough meal to swallow, literally!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Decent food and coffee, if a bit pricey. I was shocked that my $3 drip coffee in a 10oz. cup did not have refills. I don't own a coffee cup that small at home. 10 ounces of coffee is a tiny start to a day. Had to repair to a national chain for reinforcements."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This is honestly just about the best coffee I've ever had! And not by American standards - which is usually diabolical - but anywhere in the world, including Australia where we like to imagine that we make the best coffee. I may no longer believe it after visiting this place."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Really lovely staff. They get a lot of tourists who don't really know what a pour over is and they do a really great job at being patient. Good coffee, didn't have any food but it looked great!"
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This was some of the best coffee that I have ever had. The food was awesome as well. The service was impeccable. The only bad thing is getting a table, but this is to be expected for an excellent place like this."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"5 5 5 stars all the way. Beetroot humus and avocado, smoked salmon, latte and oolong tea all for the win. Everything was delicious and pretty quick out after ordering.  ....days later I'm still dreaming about returning to this heavenly spot."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great little local shop with lovely cappuccinos and delicious baked goods. Their dark roast espresso is smooth and rich and they are true foam artists!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This place is too serious. It's almost unapproachable until you start talking to the people working there.  The toast is seemingly overpriced, but then you're really hungry. So, you pay for a 8 dollar toast while thinking this is the biggest rip off since the last presidential election. You will proceed to get pissed at the toast because it's so damn good that you hate yourself for being wrong.  Also, the coffee is solid. Like Northwest solid. If it ever rains and gets cold here, and I go get a cappachino at Mazarine, it will remind me of my Seattle days in the U-district wasting time on yet another take-for-granted coffee run..."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Sylish, slick and shiney.  The espresso roast is a pleasant, soft blend that balances very well with the stretched milk - no bitterness.  There are no flavor options.  There are several quick bite options all oriented toward the modern crowd, but each are overpriced."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Love that place. Really good drinks. My wife love the Raf and their hot choc is really good but I often come by just to get their mochi pastries which are delicious!!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,One of the best avocado egg toast in the Bay Area. Serves great coffee with weekly rotation from different roaster.  Always keeps their espresso beans dialed you right throughout the day.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Their Matcha latte is great! They make the mixture in bulk so it's not traditional Matcha tea but wonderful all the same. Also has a trendy atmosphere for meeting people too.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Egg whites were runny yet yolks were solid, not even sure how that's possible but didn't enjoy them. I maybe got four super thin slices of avocado, nothing like the photos I've seen from others. Expected more for the high price tag."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,A bunch of veg options. Faultless coffee (Gibraltar!) and delicious food!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Finally! A decent espresso in SF. Tried all the hotspots and can't misses and they all missed --- consistently underextracted (thin and sour). Mazarine, however, makes a respectable espresso and cappuccino, and sipping it on the sidewalk in the sun watching the world walk by was quite enjoyable."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great vibe but only decent coffee. The avocado toast on the other hand....supberb. I'm giving it three stars though because they got my order wrong and I didn't find out until I was already in my Uber.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Coffee was great. Server was friendly and on top of her game. Ambiance was kitschy and it looked just like you would have expected from the sign out front.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Extremely nice and well presented food for such a small place. I have been here 3 weekends in a row. Highly recommend the avo eggs toast and beet hummus toast.
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great coffee and the food is nice as well
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"This cafe is my go-to for pre-work meetings as it’s oddly one of the decent coffee shops that are actually open early. Great coffee, and delicious small toasts if you need a breakfast bite too."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"If you blink, you might pass the cafe but this unassuming non-chain cafe serves up delectable savory and sweet food. The #oatcapp is available and they will even fill up your water bottle with sparkling water of you ask nicely. A nice oasis admist the bustling Market Street in San Francisco."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I like to get their Iced Breve Latte. You place your order at the front counter. They accept both cash and credit cards (including AMEX). The cashier will ask for a name for the order. Remember to spell out your name to avoid any confusion. Otherwise, your order may be ready but you didn’t recognize the name on the order. (In the past, I have had my name spelled an unusual way, because I didn’t spell it out for the cashier and the person just typed it in their own creative way. 😂 The person who made my order didn’t even bother saying the “name,” because it would be difficult to pronounce and I wouldn’t realize it was for me.) The food items are available early, no need to wait for lunch time. But it’s always a good idea to ask whether any items are sold out/unavailable."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,The latte and toast are on point! No regrets here!
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Great coffee, but that's where it ends. Overpriced, mediocre pastries slow service, I mean - extremely slow. The place is also filled with students taking up space with their laptops, who just never, ever leave. I wouldn't mind if the place was spacier and could support it. Avoid or get it to go."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"I trekked here because of the highlighted comment that there is high-speed internet. Food & service quality were high, but over-priced and they confirmed that they do not provide wifi connection. I should have stayed at the Starbucks I was standing next to when I found this place through the map search on my iPhone."
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,Great brunch spot and their toasts are a must try
Mazarine Coffee,720 Market St,"Good coffee, if a little slow - but to be honest, that's a complaint of mine generally in SF.  Baristas could learn a lot from Australian cafes arguably the best in the world for coffee quality and keeping up with a demanding crowd."
