Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Coffee To The People is my all-time favorite coffee shop in the city! It's a family-owned business, the owner June and her family work there, they are all very friendly! I love their Croissant Sandwiches, which are loaded with egg, sausage, and melted cheese!! Their coffees are great too, and they have other specialty beverages. It's located at Haight & Masonic, a very popular area for locals to gather. I'd highly recommend going there for some great local coffees and breakfast sandwiches!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Happened upon this great spot after shopping. We had a breakfast burrito, smoothies and hot chocolates and they were all great! Nice spot and great staff!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Very welcoming and reasonable prices.  Had an amazing cappuccino and a perfectly toasted poppy seed bagel with cream cheese.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Best coffee shop / cafe in the city: there is a LOT of space and tables, it's a perfect place to read or study. The vibe and decor are warm and friendly. The staff are so friendly and efficient. And their prices are unbeatable. They have a solid selection of coffee and food. I order from doordash from them too and they're always so fast and take into consideration specific requests."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Cosy Café close to a park, wooden furniture, a bit old fashioned. Very kind staff, great Ambiente and fast service. Would drink my coffee here again"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"This is a nice, quiet place to hang out in the Height Ashbury area with a good selection of books and games available. Feels very spacious, and the couches are nice, although they could be kept a bit cleaner.  I got an iced vanilla latte and was a bit disappointed to hear that they only offer dark roast espresso. The latte wasn't bad, but there was so much syrup in it that it tasted more like ice cream than a latte. This is partially because they make it more like a macchiato than a latte (syrup, then ice, then milk, then espresso on top). Prices are good though so if you're not picky about coffee then this could work for you. Also very surprised that they use plastic straws!!!!  Overall not bad, but I don't know that I'd come back because it's not really the kind of coffee experience I look for."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Good coffee with friendly staff and nice ambience. Got a mocha with almond milk and it was just right. Also got coffee for my friend and she commented on the good quality of it. Good little spot for a cup.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Drip coffee is good and inexpensive. Strangely quiet and kinda weird vibe at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Monday. wishing I had gone elsewhere- maybe bad timing I was hoping for a much better vibe in this neighborhood. Employees not super friendly either.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"This is THE BEST cafe to study in the city. Great food options, great prices, open power outlets, couches, and spaciousness all will inspire you to join the fight for the people! Long live Coffee To The People"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Cozy coffee shop, nothing fancy but good prices with lots of menu options. Great customer service and lots of seating!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"My cortado was a bit bitter, but five stars anyway because service was good, the vibe is friendly, and there is a public bathroom here in a very bathroom-sparse neighborhood."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Great ambiance, ample seating and unexpectedly huge selection of books. The mushroom quiche was amazing and full of flavor, however the mocha was lacking and barely tasted like anything. Decent value especially for SF."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Stopped in here for a quick coffee and water break and stayed a bit. The baristas were knowledgeable and friendly, and know how to pull espresso shots without burning them so their drinks stay tasty and not have the substandard burnt/bitter taste that are all too common at higher volume corporate chain shops (looking at you, chronically understaffed Starbucks)."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Being new to the area, this is the first cafe I have visited and I was very happy in my decision to try this place. The inside is a bit vacant most likely due to covid but the staff was extremely friendly and met me with a smile! I ordered a latte and asked for a recommendation for a breakfast sandwich, to which the barista gave a great recommendation.  For the lattes you can customize the amount of espresso shots between 2-4 which I requested 4. Their is limited outdoor seating but I found no trouble finding a seat to enjoy my bagel breakfast sandwich and Oatmilk latte. The barista delivered my order to the table smiling.  The coffee was extremely good and I was surprised how rich it tasted. As well, the egg, sausage, cheese, everything bagel sandwich was mouth watering. The eggs are very moist and soft so be careful to eat over a plate or wrapper or you will forever lose a portion of your sandwich.  This may be my go to cafe in this area!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Had a great breakfast bagel here this morning. Breakfast with friends and the food was very fresh and well prepared. Ambiance is pleasant and coffee was decent.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Coffee to the people is a friendly feel good coffee shop. There's ample seating, couches and tables, and cool decorations that fit the neighborhood. Three stars because the coffee itself is fair to good. The staff are very friendly."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Sometimes people want special when they visit a cafe. Others want a comfortable environment. Relative to most cafes in the city, this one will not break the bank. Wifi available.  Atmosphere is calm and service is kind. Not even the hills of Haight will keep me away."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,cozy and inviting. love the energy in here. mocha with oat milk is 10/10. highly recommended!! :-)
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Nice coffee shop, a bit run down but nice atmosphere."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"The veggie lasagna was a treat to the senses. Friendly staff, fast service, decent prices with depicting atmosphere of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Made me pay two dollars to use the restroom, even though the person I was with spent over fifteen dollars on items from the store. Kinda petty imo."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Seriously bomb plain not plain food it's literally AMAZING same 2 Asian women run the place and have a tossed out random as a 3rd .. and they gave me a piece of tile left it on the stoop. Mr. Man fed me bagel sandwich every night musta known I'm poison ivy's daughter ;)
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,The heart of the Haight hippie scene. 9-10am is best if you want to meet the local musicians and characters. Everybody is welcome. Service is friendly. Pastries and coffee are wonderful. Modest pricing.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,banana bread is super good and the service is great! been here probably 50x
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Very friendly staff. There is always a free table and a chill atmosphere.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,The staff was on point. The coffee is awesome. I got a regular coffee. this is my first experience at this shop. I enjoyed it very much. It was so rich and bold. And honestly to me if you can make a regular coffee taste so awesome sign me up lol. I cant wait to try the rest of their menu. I also really loved the environment. It was very welcoming.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Great place with excellent coffee. Very clean and great service. Relaxing atmosphere in a very good location
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,What cafe place does not offer power outlets. You loose business cz you are a cheap. Don’t complain later
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Delicious iced caramel latte, I had to buy it to use the bathroom 🤣 but the store was chill."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Lovely And helpful staff, hummus baggle was amazing! Deli sandwiches And good Prices."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Not much natural light and no outlets, so it's pretty inhospitable to locals who need a place to relax for a while. They had wifi but it dropped out on me multiple times to the point that I had to leave. The baristas weren't the friendliest and the coffee was weak. Card minimum of $5 meant I had to buy food--the egg+cheese croissant was surprisingly not bad at all. I live around the corner and will probably only return if I desperately need coffee to-go. Also pigeons kept wandering in (??)."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"I love that place and the people that work there.  The food is pretty good.  Bowdie, the cafe manager is very friendly.  She greets you with a warm welcome and she has your order ready very fast.  Not only is she efficient in everything she does,  she also can remember what everyone usually orders.  To me that's amazing."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,I like the Fengshui at this coffee shop.  It's an old place to relax.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Whether your in the mood for tea, coffee or a specialty breakfast drink, Coffee to the People has you covered.  As well as having a comfortable setting to have your morning cream cheese on a bagel or pastry of your choosing, while lounging on the leather couches, reading one of the many books they have available in their personal library.  Very cozy atmosphere and friendly accommodating staff."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Excellent place to stop and have a nice coffee at a reasonable price. Sink in sofas, great for long chats with friends, plenty of power outlets."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Not bad for a coffee place. I've been to many but the quality of coffee is what sets some apart from others. The main detail comes from how the staff processes the beans and if they already grounded the beans too early to save time.  Honestly, if the beans were grounded and coffee was made to order, it would taste great in which this place DOES do that!  I had my mocha made and it was to order so the taste was fantastic, the cream was fresh and coffee was strong, that is pretty much it. Not bad for the price of this coffee."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee, decor, and staff. The cafe is a quiet hang out for conversation or just to get some peace. I tried the hemp coffee, which was smooth tasting and very flavorful. There's plenty of seating as well. I was able to catch up with friends I haven't seen in years and all four of us were able to sit comfortably, even though the place was crowded. The owners were also polite and served the group our orders quickly. Definitely going back to this place when I visit again."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,The staff is friendly and we gotnout drinks about 45 seconds after we ordered. They tasted great! We will definitely be back.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Delicious oat milk latte. Great atmosphere!
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"The coffee and food a great, staff is nice. The Wi-Fi through is very unreliable and frequently cuts out. Not good for working remotely"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Plenty of space inside and good service
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Great customer service, very friendly and upbeat.  A lot of character inside the cafe, with hipster art and an assortment of books for customers.  The food is lovely and there are enough options for vegans and vegetarians, they even substitute dairy milk for non -dairy alternatives in all their drinks!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,A very nice place to get a coffee in the area with a spacious and welcoming environment. The coffee was good and the staff courteous and efficient. Stopped here for a classic cup of coffee.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"I really appreciated finding that really big space to sit, plug my phone an rest for a while, but I have to say the service wasn't really good and the staff were polite just enough. The coffee wasn't the best. On the plus side, the place is peaceful, the music is good and customers ar just the same. The decoration is nice and it's good to think about the whole ideology hat is behind it."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"As a cafe and coffee lounge, it's very average - the bay area is overflowing with better quality places.  But for getting work done, theres tons of outlets; The staff are very kind; The menu is comparitively inexpensive; Location is great; And the place is all around bewilderingly unpretentious, considering it's a corner cafe on Haight St."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Classic Haight stop. Comfortable seating and a nice place to read or enjoy a game of chess.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"I adore this place.  If it doesn't turn you on to hemp milk, you're doing it wrong. It's your fault. The service is prompt and very friendly, the food and coffee are reasonably priced and delicious (try the veggie hummus bagel--it's perfection), and there's always enough seating.  Big plus: board games, a whole shelf of books, and free wifi!  It's also on Masonic and not directly on Haight which tends to be more crowded and dirty."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"What a great little soot with delicious treats and fun signature drinks. There's space to read, work, or take a breather. I highly recommend it!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"They aren't very thoughtful with their espresso, so don't expect an artisanal latte, but there's fast wifi, ample seating, and the owners are really philanthropic with the local homeless population, which is very meaningful to me!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"This place doesn't know what it wants to be, maybe a bit alike the entire neighborhood. There are traces of hippieness on the walls and decor, signs of Starbucksification on the menu and demeanors, and visits by tourists and bathroom-seekers.  The coffeeshop is an OK place to work with solid wifi, even though the venue is a bit on the noisy side. It's also frustrating that the bathroom is almost always occupied. I have ordered (very inexpensive) reheated vegan lasagna for lunch, and it fulfilled its purpose and my stomach. I also got a latte, which was ordinary, and afterwards, a pot of tea. They have an excellent tea selection, and the tea was good."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Cute little coffee shop good for a break after shopping. Many good options for cheap and they have very good smoothies. Kinda dark inside but it's a sunny day it's ok. Also free wifi so a good place to work as there lots of table space
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Alot of businesses in the Haight try and capture the whole Haight Ashbury experience. I'm a unicorn born and raised in the Haight so I'm not impressed with the atmosphere. All that said their coffee is great. Comfy couches to sit and relax . Well lit and staff is friendly and helpful. But when you throw up a Gerry Garcia posters and summer of love stuff just takes some away originality for me
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Got an iced coffee for a little over $3. After they gave us the coffee and we paid, we asked for a non dairy creamer as we both avoid cream in our coffee and was told that soy, almond, hemp, or coconut would be $1 or $1.25 extra. Just to add a little to our coffee. I have NEVER seen this at any cafe before. $1.25 for a tiny bit of coconut milk? I could buy an entire can for that. If I'm getting a latte or something then sure, charge a little to sub for another milk. But not just to top off my coffee. Absolutely insane. Wish I had chosen one of the other many coffee shops nearby who wouldn't have CHARGED ME TO ADD MILK TO MY COFFEE. Wow."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"I wasn't a big fan of this place. It does give free wifi so if you want to work, you can bring your laptop. There are some couches that can be comfy but the drinks are not that great. Usually, I stick to blended drinks and teas (I'm not a coffee fan) but the blended drink had little flavor. There are a lot of characters but it's what you can expect in the Haight."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"This cute little hole in the wall is everything SF. It is a small run cafe, with a library, games, and WiFi. The breakfast is pretty good if you like specialty bagels or breakfast sandwiches. There is a revolutionary feel for peace which echoes the neighborhood. One downside are the homeless youth that take refuge outside of the cafe- but hey, that’s the Haight."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Really expensive for pretty crappy service and food. I waited a while at the counter before anyone even came to help me, and then the woman was unfriendly and disengaged. She gave me a mostly unmixed and 3/4 ice Italian Soda, and I paid but didn't leave a tip (since she was really rude). When I walked away from the counter without tipping she muttered something venomous under her breath. I would not recommend this place at all."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Great place to grab a quick cup of coffee on the way to work. I've only ever had coffee/lattes but their baked goods look good. Never super crowded which is really nice
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"They have wifi but no outlets. Chai tea and croissant were mediocre. Nice, old haight vibe though."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Didn't get a chance to try any of the specialty coffees here. Hit this place up mid morning on a Saturday, before all the tourists really descended upon the upper haight, and therefore the place was pretty much dead empty. Being a huge spot, it felt a little weird, a huge, hippie-esque coffee shop with counterculture propaganda all over it, but no one in it, really. You can play board games here, and chill out, people watch, dope up on coffee, and have a relaxing time I bet, since it's one door off the beaten path. And if all you need is a coffee after brunch on a saturday before all the hungover people wake up, it's fine for that too."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Your average neighborhood coffee shop. It was pretty quiet, and I noticed a lot of people studying/working/reading. My friends and I came in to hide from the rain, but we ended up staying several hours to (quietly and respectfully) play some scrabble and warm up. I ended up ordering the Flower Power, which is essentially a dirty chai tea latte. Another friend got a chocolate mocha drink and it came with sprinkles! Very cute :) I wouldn't say they were anything extraordinary, but they were very appreciated and enjoyed fully. The coffee is also strong! If you need a pick-me-up, this is the place to go.  Note: If you need to use the restroom, you have to ask the staff to buzz you in."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Coffee To The People? Who are these people? The ones who can buy houses in Cole Valley or the ones who took the Muni here from Fisherman's Wharf because they heard it was edgy? This place plays Billboard Top 100 and is adorned with books about diets, dogs, and dime-store novels. Their drinks are as uninspired as the decor and there is a weird sign that forbids, of all things, sleeping. Ok. Is this a Starbucks?"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,The people really made it a great experience.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"The people who work here are nice, there is a lot of seating, and they have tons of board games! There are a bunch of activist bumper stickers covering the walls, and they have dreamcatchers on display. There is free wi-fi and outlets available. It's right next to the 71, 6, and 43 bus stops."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Found shelter in here during a downpour while I was shopping on Haight. The coffee was delicious and warm- but not hot. The couches are comfy and perfect for curling up and reading a book, like the one you just bought at Booksmith down the street."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,I go here almost every day. They give my dog great treats and they are trustworthy wholesome people. Despite the crowd that might hang out in front 🤗 …
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Cood coffee, nice people and it's very relaxed. There's no rush to turn tables like the corporate coffee shops."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"After two weeks of bad coffee, we hit on this place. Good coffee and really friendly staff..."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Great Coffee always is a plus, but sometimes it comes with a consequence, in this case Hippie/Dog conference! Yes, everytime I walk by, there's always the Co-Op Anarcho/Communist or whatever you want to call them, outside with their dogs. If you can handle that, I'd go in, as the interior of a place is JUST as important as what's going on outside. I must admit their wall decor is decent. Overall, It's a stalemate with my review, I would go in again, if the coast is "" hippie "" clear."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Chill student coffee house vibe. Book shelf, ample sofas, coffee is a bit cheaper than elsewhere. Came in from the street to find the perfect low key place to refresh."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,Fun place in a funky neighborhood. Prices run about the same or sometimes cheaper than starbucks and at a MUCH higher quality. Nice vibe and free wifi!
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Good selection of food and drinks including coffee and other tasty treats. However I've been treated poorly every time I order, and have been bothered about using the restroom even after buying something for more times than I can count that I stopped going"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Staff is rude, they served my friend moldy food from that glass case. Ive seen moldy food in there since then and they just took out the piece of mold not knowing its All contaminated with mold spores.. business should be shut down. The glass case holds the same food for a week at a time or more then they wont refund your money for it"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Popped by this local coffee shop on a Saturday for an iced coffee. It has an arty counterculture vibe that fit-in well with the Haight Ashbury neighborhood and lots of coffee options. I felt a little overwhelmed by the number of options, so I settled (a little lamely) on a vanilla iced coffee. There were lots of way cooler options, including a Matcha Tea Latte or a Mint and Matcha Tea Latte. Lots of board games and local art made this spot a nice place where I could imagine reading and whittling away an afternoon reading or playing games. Will hit it up again when I'm back in the area."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"I like to go here when I am in the neighborhood. It has comfortable couches and tables, with a Haight-y feel that is not too strong. The coffee and tea are also good."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"The coffee here is good, but what I love coming here for more than that, is for the atmosphere. I love coming here to study in the corner. It's a nice, not too quiet place to come and sip on some coffee."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Great atmosphere, nice staff, amazing history, and great place for breakfast. Make sure to check out the sticker wall!"
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,This is one of my favorite coffee shops in the city! It's cozy and the staff are friendly. Free WiFi and they even have board games. What more could you want?
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,I like strong coffee and they have it here. It's a good place to talk. Given it's just off Haight street I was surprised at how clean the restroom was.
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Great cappuccino foam. Nice, bright atmosphere."
Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Cozy atmosphere and couches to sit on. Friendly staff, and free WiFi. If you want a place to sit and work on your laptop, this is the best one in the area."

Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Always fast, good service. The coffee is tasty. I only take things to go bit it seems like a cool place to hangout"

Coffee To The People,1206 Masonic Ave,"Tables are unstable, if you rest your foot on the base of the small round tables, they may tilt significantly, spilling your hot coffee everywhere...this should not be an issue at a coffee shop"
