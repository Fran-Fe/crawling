Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,I always end up door dashing from this spot for breakfast burritos and figured it was high time I left a review.  One of my go-to spots for a solid breakfast burrito.  The taste profile is probably different from the breakfast burritos you’re used to but in a good way. The chipotle sauce lends a creamy  aspect to the burrito and really complements all the other ingredients perfectly.  The ratio of everything is perfect and the grilled marks on the outside is the *chefs kiss*  Check this place out the next time you’re craving a good solid breakfast burrito.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,My boyfriend and I went here while visiting San Fran and really enjoyed the food and coffee we got. The flavors really jumped out and tasted very unique. I loved their Chipotle sauce on my bacon breakfast burrito. My bf had the pesto sauce and chicken on his which was also amazing. I attached photos of the seating area which was only outside.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Been craving a breakfast burrito and glad I found this place with food that was quick, delicious and nutritious. They have some outdoor seating nearby but it’s primarily designed around takeout. Definitely worth adding the avocado for a creamy feel."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Delicious breakfast burrito, tons of flavor & great price. Added black beans & chicken protein. Super friendly service too! Would definitely come back!!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Great burrito and bagels. We had our breakfast here every day. They open pretty early which played in our cards. The staff is very friendly and even remembered our names after our first visit! Thank you very much from Europe!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Superb as usual.  Just got a coffee this time, but highly recommend their breakfast burritos (only eat half before a meeting though), their chai latte, and their delectable desserts.  Coffee is good too!  This is what I normally get (coffee, vegetarian burrito, and a dessert)."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Surprisingly good breakfast burrito with delicious sauce. Adding potato is a must. Decent latte and cookie, too.  No indoor seating but there’s some outdoor seating next to the cafe."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Service is 10 out of 5 stars!!! Server ran 2 blocks to give us part of our order that we forgot. Now that is service! Food is good, price is reasonable. Their breakfast burrito is one of the best I had. The kids scored their bagel BLT 4/5."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Best breakfast burrito in town - add the potatoes + avocado. It comes grilled with cheese is the hashbrowns it’s just insane. It doesn’t make any sense coming out of an Italian restaurant but just do it. The service is also amazing!!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,I'm a visitor in town. Have been here for Breakfast Burritos twice in a row. The service is friendly and the food is exceptional. The staff seem to know everyone who visits by name too. I cannot speak highly enough about this place.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"I've been in San Francisco a couple of days, and I grabbed lunch here twice. I ordered paninis, which were wonderful and filling. Great service. I absolutely recommed this place for take-away (I did not see any indoor seating)."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"What great luck to be staying near this place. I can confidently vouch for the great reviews. My wife and I have been in SF 2 days so far and we have had breakfast here both days. The breakfast burritos really are the best I’ve had. My wife loved her croissant sandwich as well. The coffee was pretty good too!  In addition to the great food, there is very friendly service. If you are planning to be there after 7:30 or 8, you may want to consider ordering ahead."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Great taste, great price (for San Francisco), food always ready on time.  A regular breakfast place when visiting San Francisco and staying near by. Easy decision to walk past a couple Starbucks to come here, you won’t be disappointed!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Do not sleep on their breakfast burritos. Voted best in Bay Area! As others said, add potatoes! Coffee is good and fresh OJ!  Probably just as important, the people who work here are so incredibly kind. While waiting for a few minutes for our food we saw the owner personally great several patrons by name and already knew their orders/had them ready for them. You can see this is where the locals go. He also gave several burritos and a coffee to a homeless man on the cold, rainy morning we visited. Someone next to me then whispered he’s one of the sweetest men.  Go for the food… but know you’re helping support someone who supports others!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"This is the best breakfast burrito (shrimp) I’ve ever had, period. And the guy who took my order was cool af, go here, you will not regret it.  Takeout only so have somewhere to sit and basque in the greatness."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Great take away breakfast point. You'll probably hang out waiting your to be prepared. Jeff work behind the desk with so much energy and good communication.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Amazing breakfast spot! I love that it is an outdoor pick up window setup it makes it super easy for me to grab breakfast while walking the dog. I love the meat lovers burrito and my iced latte is always perfect they really get the coffee right here. The guy who works the front in the early morning is incredibly friendly and gives amazing customer service. I work nearby and I always send visitors here since it's truly 5 stars quality tough to find in financial district
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Nice little spot for a little stop to get tea or a burrito. Also some vegan options. I appreciated the fresh coconut water not a can but a bottle. Friendly service.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,A great experience for us. Staff remembered my girlfriend and I from yesterday and welcomed us back. Food is great and coffee is fresh. Will definitely be returning once we’re back in SF!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Literally the best breakfast you can get in SF. Visited once a year before, and had to go back. Jeff is really sweet and always tells you to have a good day!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,The best breakfast burrito I’ve ever ate. This place seriously lives up to its hype. The pricing is great as well.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Super friendly staff, great food with reasonable prices. They have fresh homemade scones and pastries they bake every morning. Take out only, but they have outdoor tables."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"The breakfast burritos here are amazing! The coffee is great too, but the real stars are the chipotle breakfast burritos. We tried the meatlovers and the avocado. The quality was excellent, and I loved the pepper mix in the scrambled eggs. I’d cover all my food with their chipotle mayo if I could."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"This is the best breakfast/lunch spot in all of FiDi. The breakfast burrito is far superior to any other in town. Grilled to perfection. Crispy bacon (if you choose this protein, but they have many other choices as well) The mocha is also quite delicious, and I think having it with oat milk adds another layer of flavor that shouldn’t be missed. They also serve up bomb pastas for lunch and have a great salad menu as well. Try it all, come back for seconds and thirds. Let them get to know your name and you’ll see that their service goes far above and beyond making great food. Staple in the community."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"OMG! Took a break from my walk across America to crash at a hotel, do some laundry, and dry my rained-out gear. Was looking for a top rated coffee shop that was open now, and Il Canto popped up. Once I took a peek at the menu, I ordered the most scrumptious breakfast burrito...and this coming from a Texas gal. Lovely team members who clearly clear about the food they create for their customers. HIGHLY recommend. 👍👍"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Excellent burrito/latte. Good price. Friendly service. Neat external eating area. Highly recommended.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Truly one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had! I got bacon and added potatoes and it was incredible. They have a delicious chipotle sauce. Service was very friendly and I highly recommend!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Absolutely stunning. Fast service, delicious food, very convenient location. No eating inside option when I visited, but they still get a 5 for atmosphere since they were slammed and the staff still took the time to tailor my order and were very pleasant. Try the shrimp breakfast burrito!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"An iconic breakfast burrito you’ll have dreams about after you try it, giant home made l Reese’s peanut butter cup cookies, and delicious food at reasonable prices. What else can you ask for?"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"My favorite breakfast burrito ever. I come to SF once a quarter at least and I make a point to come here every time. It’s consistent, the staff is SO nice, and they pay attention to the little things. Things such as grilling the burrito and having the ingredients inside evenly distributed are some examples. But it just tastes amazing. That’s all you need to know. Go try it!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,This place is pretty great. The people that work there care. The food was fresh and hot. There was a line but they got through the orders pretty quickly.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Best breakfast burrito I've ever had! I added bacon & avo to mine. The cafe mocha is delicious, too. They make you feel like a valued customer. I can't wait to come back."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Their breakfast burrito is super addictive 😍  Always busy with a lot of delivery orders and business people from financial district. It worth waiting though, because they provide such an amazing service and a hearty breakfast. Always nice and efficient. Appreciate your hard work 🙏"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Good service … no dine in but there are tables outside on the left side.  Breakfast burrito and cappuccino were tasty.

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Easily one of the best breakfast burritos you will ever eat. Extremely tasty and always cooked to perfection. Friendly service and reasonable prices make this a no brainier.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Pretty tasty and flavorful veggie breakfast sandwich. I just wish the size was bigger. The sandwich left me wanting for more :D
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Probably one of the best little deli spots in the city. Excellent breakfast burrito and surprisingly amazing cappuccino.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Great coffee shop! Went here two mornings in a row. The staff was so friendly and greeted us with a smile. They even remembered how we liked our coffee and asked if we wanted it the same way again! The veggie sandwich on a croissant is amazing! Highly recommend!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Love love love the breakfast burritos! Very filling and gets better with every bite
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Handy place to grab breakfast or lunch in an area with few restaurant options, especially on weekends. Friendly service, delicious food!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"The gods truly smiled down on this place and graced us with their breakfast burritos. I will gladly die on the hill that these are the best breakfast burritos I have, or ever will have, in my life. Found them on DoorDash one fateful day and was thrilled when I learned that they are a few blocks from my work. My interactions with employees were equally as amazing. Very kind and quick for service. You can't have a bad experience here, it is impossible."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Had the breakfast burrito with sausage. It was filling enough to share with a friend but SO delicious you won't want to!! Add avocado if you want, and enjoy. The burrito was expertly rolled then pressed. Easy to eat. Highly recommended"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Hearty, solid takeaway breakfast and lunch - spiffy friendly service and one of the few in FiDi operating all week long - thumbs up!!"

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Probably the best breakfast burrito I’ve ever had. Highly recommend the grilled breakfast burrito - so crispy and so good with fresh avocado! Extremely friendly staff too. No seating. The cold brew was much too dark for my liking, but the burrito is outstanding!"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Excellent excellent breakfast burrito and amazing service which everybody was so friendly early in the morning! I would come back here again soon!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Food was warm AND delicious. The burritos were wrapped and packed nicely too. Staff is super friendly. Orange juice was fresh too.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Delicious breakfast burrito and very affordable compared to everywhere else around here.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"I took a three block detour to grab a sandwich here. I am so glad I did.  Got the veggie sandwich on a sesame bagel. It took a few minutes to make, but it was so warm and fresh. The bagel is packed to the brim and tasty as heck!!  Highly recommend. While i didn't get the orange juice, it looked like i missed out on it! So next time"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Breakfast burrito with avocado! Slaps.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Il Canto Café is a small independent sandwich shop that I’ve passed by many times when going to Sapphire Asian cusine which is next door. I decided to finally give it a try a couple of weeks ago. Being a small place it was packed during my first visit. The menu is simple a bunch of panini’s, salads and some readymade pasta. I decided to get the Chipotle chicken panini ($8) which as per the menu is chipotle sauce, jack cheese, chicken, spinach, tomatoes on a ciabatta roll. After ordering it was a short 10 minute wait and I was on my way.  The panini had two problems. First, the contents were not thawed out properly before being toasted so all the chicken tasted like a cold hard lump. I understand that you have to refrigerate the sandwiches to avoid a Chipotle type of situation but you have to thaw them out correctly before toasting them. I had to let the sandwich sit for about 20 minutes to get the contents to proper room temperature but that made the sandwich soggy. The second issue was the panini was over toasted. It was in the press for a couple of minutes more than it should have been making the bread extremely crispy. Overall this was not a good panini.  Obviously I was not very impressed with my first visit so I was in no hurry to return. I decided to give them another try a couple of days ago. This time they were not that full. I decided to get the chicken breast panini ($8) which as per the menu is pesto, chicken breast, spinach, tomatoes, provolone cheese on focaccia bread. This time I observed process a little closely. The sandwich was first microwaved to thaw it out and then toasted in a panini press. This time the panini was only marginally better. At least it was thawed correctly, but could have used a little more time in the toaster.  Price wise it is in line with what you will pay at other independent sandwich shops in the area but consistency in quality is lacking. I think they have potential but need to fine-tune their process a little more. Competition in this area is intense (there are 30+ sandwich shops in a 1 mile radius in downtown) so when benchmarked against other independent sandwich shops like Front Door Café, Good Luck Café, Chez Julien etc. they do need to take a step to catchup."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Delicious breakfast burrito!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"They deserve 6 stars. They are so nice,  and the breakfast burrito was tasty. They let me charge my phone too. No indoor dining, but a nice patio with tables. Drip coffee was great too and fresh, no burnt or ""old"" taste."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"The breakfast burritos were really good but that's the least of the story for me. The staff was so nice. I felt like they truly wanted me to start my day off great. Thanks for the kind message on my bag and the deliciousness inside the bag, I gobbled it down."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Interesting breakfast Burritos, I dig the tofu, usually add avocado and you're good! I pass Starbucks up at rhe corner then grab one of these on my way to the office and I'm set to get through my day."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Fantastic breakfast spot. Really really liked the breakfast burrito, and the bagel sandwich was also quite good. Honestly, it's the scrambled eggs (made with red bell peppers, green onions, and sriracha) that they put in their dishes that steals the show. So get what you enjoy with the eggs in it.  When I was in the area we went there for 3/3 meals; why even bother finding something else when this place is so reliable?  Be prepared to wait 20+ minutes though due to high demand."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"I showed up on a Sunday at 06:00 as I’m from east coast and body clock says it’s 09:00. Two ladies were very polite and courteous.  Although they were in process of setting up, they made me a great burrito and fresh coffee.  Very courteous and polite.  Went back every morning of my trip and same courteous service and great breakfast."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,This is the kind of breakfast burrito that you eat and immediately crawl back into bed and take a nap. And I mean that in the best way possible.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Breakfast spot right here. Yummy food, love the burrito. You all Rock Staff is highly attentive and very friendly thank you all. Great coffee too"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Ordered ahead through their website and it was sitting on the counter waiting when we got there. I was inclined to be skeptical about the breakfast burritos, but they were great! I got the bacon and DH got the sausage. The chipotle sauce was just the right amount of creamy/spicy that enhanced the flavors without taking over. The burrito was beautifully rolled and wrapped (no drip on the business clothes), had great char marks on it, and all the fillings were well combined. You got the egg, meat, cheese, sauce and green onions in every bite. It was delightful. Also SO filling! A great, hearty breakfast on the go. (There’s only a few tables and chairs and no indoor seating, so plan to take it to go.)"
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Stayed in San Francisco or business and saw high reviews on Google prompting me to go. Definitely worth it. Fast service and the meat lovers breakfast burrito and iced coffee hit the spot. Highly recommend!!!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,The most delicious breakfast sandwich I've ever had! The eggs are very fluffy with a nice spicy kick. The service is also fast and friendly. Would love to get my breakfast here again :)

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"My wife and I were in San Francisco for a few days and this place gets 5 stars.  We were there at 6 am and what a way to start the day with good customer service, the staff was kind and friendly.  Our recommendation is the breakfast burrito, it was delicious."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Respect the delivery drivers. You guys treat customers like a God but you guys see the food delivery drivers like trash. We are humans too. We are working hard to feed our family. Show some respect or stop offering delivery service.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Jeff is the hardest working man in show business. Get the breakfast sandwich.
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"The breakfast burrito is absolutely amazing. I came here 3 days in a roll with my parent and my son when we visited San Francisco. Not only the food is delicious, the service also outstanding."

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,Great food 😋 Delicious coffee ☕. No seating 🤥
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,I was visiting San Fran and this cafe was close to my hotel and this was such a great find.

The staff was very friendly and even remembered my name after only one time of stopping by. Highly recommend!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,A strong cup of joe and the most delicious breakfast burrito I've ever had. Chipotle mayo is delicious. Also they are open early.

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,This place has delicious breakfast options and the service was fast and friendly! Perfect for those in the neighborhood who need a quick bite of something hot and tasty to eat!
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"Their chipotle breakfast burrito has a mean and bold flavor.  It comes from the creamy chipotle sauce and melted, what I think is cheddar, cheese.  It is rich from start to finish, which is good or bad depending on your taste.  There are bits of your chioice of protein and vegetables in the scrambled egg filling.  Personally, I think there is too much egg filling, which throws the eggs-vegies-protein ratio, but maybe I am just being picky.  I think I will try it again to confirm."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,found this place on accident and tried my luck at the chicken alfredo - was the best decision of the day! absolutely delicious! and the staff was very sweet and kind.

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"I use my meal pal pass here about 3 times in the last month now.  I really like their panini, it's pretty awesome for the price. Especially since I got it through Meal Pal, it was about $6 with tax included for lunch. I have the 12 meal pass.  Beware the lines do get a bit long during rush hours so make sure you order through meal pal, use other forms of Pre-ordering, or go before 12 and after 1. I've seen others wait but I never had to wait in line, I just pick up my meal at the cash register.  Go try their paninis now!"

Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"This place is a must if you’re in the financial district! My wife and I tried several breakfast items along with amazing lattes, and kept going back day after day for more. Jeff is an amazing person, full of positive energy, and never loses his smile. Even with 10+ people at the window the wait for the food was never more than 10 minutes. Absolutely don’t skip this place while in SF."
Il Canto Cafe,475 Sacramento St,"A small shop I found by accident, the food taste combines Italian taste with Chinese elements and American flavor. The stuffing is very rich. We ordered the vegan flavor. You can choose avocado or tofu... It is very delicious. I will come again next time I have the opportunity to come to San Francisco."
