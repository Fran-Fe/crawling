Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"fresh, delicious, healthy, with wonderful service. a real soma gem!! i love the nicoise salad and egg salad sandwich."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Would rate more than 5 stars if possible. Stopped at this unassuming place for a quick brunch and were blown away by the staff's friendliness and care in preparation of our brunch. Food was phenomenal, bread was superb, avocados were perfect, fruit salad was delicious, and mango smoothie was exacting in fruit and spinach ratio. When asked for salt and pepper with our to-go order the staff hand ground some black pepper and pink sea salt into tiny takeout containers for us! Perfect!"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Very unassuming place but impressed a diner like me. This place is underrated in my opinion. Owner is warm and friendly from France. Popped by while waiting for my car rental nearby. I ordered Mushroom sandwich (add chicken) which I thought was perfect. One of the best breakfast around the corner. Latte was no ordinary latte, very good!"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Just incredible! I was the only one present and walked right in and ordered the Turkey Avocado, OJ, and an Espresso so I could do some work. Everything was made to perfection. Bravo!"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"I must say my pictures don’t do justice to this place. I am a petit person of 5’2 but this place def serves big portions. The owner is such an amazing pop with culinary career in France and Italy, so the sandwiches are the European ciabatta sandwich which I haven’t seen much in SF. I got the Brie prosciutto sandwich and my friend got the mango salad—first day of serving the salad according to the owner. The portion is HUGE  with chicken tossed in herb/aioli(?) sauce, super flavorful. I am def coming back to try the rest of the menu. The food does take a bit of time to come out since it’s run by two lovely people but its def worth the wait."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Bright Shiny sandwich place to look forward to between tall buildings. The owner is very welcoming and the food is wonderful. Fresh ingredients put together on a warm crunch bread. I can't wait to go back!
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Incredible chicken sandwich. Also try the apple butter! Best sandwich I’ve had in SF. Fantastic customer service, even ran down the road to find me when I left my bag in the shop. Complete legend."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"This place is absolutely amazing. So cute and comforting, food is all so good. Big portions for a great price. We had a big group and tried the chicken tarragon sandwich, the Caesar salad, and the poki bowl. I highly recommend all of it! We’ll be back :)"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Small restaurant that I think does mainly take out but my husband and I sat out by the sidewalk and enjoyed brunch. The Croque Madam was delicious and the staff was great.
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"We had lunch here, and it was exquisite! The service was really warm and authentic as well. I was visiting from the UK, but I will remember this place when I visit San Francisco again."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"The chicken sandwich is without a doubt one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Full stop.  The owner (presumably, maybe he's a manager or just seems to be in charge) is one of the nicest people you'll come across in the business.  Oh, and it's super affordable with large portion sizes."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Cosy little cafe by the road. Good food , good prices and friendly staffs."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"It's the best breakfast I have had in California, it's delicious"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Incredibly quaint, cute place.  delicious food.  The best turkey avocado sandwich I have ever had!  I had a sandwich/salad combination and it was fantastic.  I am in town for the week and would definitely come back again."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Found this restaurant on Google and super happy we did.  This was definitely a good find today. We had their soup squash curry special today.  I had salad & portobello, brie, & red pepper sandwich on crusty bread.  Hubby  had omelette ham, cheese, spinach, & ham.  With a cup of “fresh” mango.  Michael was a delight.  Everything was so clean.  We will be coming back soon."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"WOW!!  A little bit of France right here in San Francisco. Great place for a group of 3 that wanted both pastries and’real breakfast’. The almond croissant was just like Paris. The eggs and bacon were superb and came with delicious, fresh homemade toast. The owner waited on us, and was cheerful, fun and helpful"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Great salads and sandwiches made fresh. The small salad portion is more like a large so come hungry or save half for later. Whether or not you have to wait in line depends on the day.
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"My experience here felt intimate because the owner is very hands on, insuring a great meal at a great location. I recommend the chicken Tarragon sandwich which was amazing. This place has something special going on."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,One of the best sandwiches I've ever experienced. A little slice of Paris in San Francisco.
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Absolute favorite go to spot for brunch, coffee and pastry. Hands down the best quality food and coffee in the neighborhood and reasonably priced relative to other places. Owner and staff are exceptionally welcoming. Place is incredibly cozy and well kept with European flair. Highly recommend it for locals and visitors!"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"I had a caffe latte on each of two occasions last week at Cafe Du Soleil.  The drinks were outstanding.  We enjoyed great seating on the sidewalk.  Service inside was very pleasant and the operator/owner even spoke French (!) consistent with the name of the venue.  On my second visit, late in the afternoon, I ordered two caffe lattes and asked that they be decaf.  When they arrived at the table, I asked for confirmation that they were decaf and the server (owner?) realized they were not.  Without prompting, he graciously took back the drinks and a few minutes later returned with decaf replacements.  That's great service."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Got the chicken, avo, mango salad and it’s soooo yummy!"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Perfect place. The best you can get. Don't miss out! The owner is so nice and friendly. The food is amazing and made by the best ingredients with much love.
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Terrible service. Just need a coffee to go. The guy at the register was babbling on the phone without taking my order. Waited for a good 3-4 mins and he shushed me when I tried to order
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Such a positive experience. Fresh delicious sandwiches, genuine and kind service, cute place. 5/5"
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Very good place for sandwiches. My favorite is roasted chicken warm sandwich in french baguette (with tomatoes in it - it becomes so juicy and nice!)
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Fantastic french cafe - their salads are the best you can find in the area. Sandwiches are always delicious.  It’s a bit of a walk for me to get there at lunch between meetings when I WFH or else I’d be there a lot more often!
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,"Really good salads and sandwiches here. The salads are a really good value as the large salad is huge and can honestly be split into two meals. My favorite is the Turkey sandwich. The owner is very friendly and talkative. The one downside is that they are really slow. However, if you call ahead or order online, you won't have to wait in line and can just pick it up when its ready which is what I do 95% of the time."
Cafe Du Soleil,345 3rd St,Get the smoked salmon tartine. So yummy
