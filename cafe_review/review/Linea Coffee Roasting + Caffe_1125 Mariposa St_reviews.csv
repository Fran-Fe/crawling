Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Linea is exactly the SF coffee vibe you imagine when you think of third wave coffee roasters in the city. The coffee, including the drip coffee, here is delicious and tasty, the interior is beautiful and aesthetic, and the seating area plus location feel very homey.  All in all, Linea is awesome, but I do have to ding them a few points because it does feel overpriced in return so you’re paying for the experience. Compared to some other shops in SF or NY most drinks here are a little more expensive or come in smaller sizes."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Lovely little coffee shop that sits right near the bottom of Potrero Hill. It’s busy most mornings but the coffee was decently good. The only issue is that there are some drinks that are overpriced. My mocha itself was about 12-16oz and $7 with no milk substitutes. Other than that, the donut that I got was splendid and the coffee wasn’t half bad!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Wow that was disappointing. I review coffee shops for the coffee, and the cappuccino I got was plain bad. Struggled to taste the beans over the cooked egg taste of over-steamed milk. No way I'm paying $30 for 10oz beans with that taste left in my mouth. Add insult to injury and it was the most expensive capp I've ever ordered, ringing in at $5.75.  Espresso nerds: don't believe the hype, go somewhere else."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Very smooth espresso I ordered.  They do the in-house roasting which means they can control the quality of roasting.  Very good and I recommended it.  It's running, their logo looks like my favorite camera, Leica, of course."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Great coffee & pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse! There is also a decent amount of outdoor bench seating in a parklet.  We got an iced latte, iced matcha latte, and a curry potato puff pastry. Would definitely choose the latte over the matcha next time but both were very solid options. The pastry was excellent especially loved the black sesame seeds and crispy edges."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Great coffee. Oat cap is flavorful yet not too bitter and drier than most. They often have sale bags of coffee to brew at home which are also great. Everything I’ve had here is good, highly recommend."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Delicious espresso drinks here. Excellent dunks made right every time. Baristas are very nice.  They also carry Neighbor bake house baked goods, so you can conveniently pick up a quality snack as well.  I believe this is where they roast their coffee beans. We so prefer this over their mission location."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"The more attitude a barista throws your way, the better the coffee. I’m serious. This is an excellent way to gauge the quality of your coffee drink. This coffee is great; the barista was mean. My heart was pounding with fear after making a comment about how the music was cool and her response, after a long pause, was that the fans of this music are worse than the music itself. 10/10 for scaring me into submission and checking me - I forgot that small talk is not acceptable. But truly, dang, this coffee is so good. Let the data show: a rude barista makes the best coffee."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,The latte has a distinct chocolate and caramel tasting note! Bought the “Espresso” and “Little Wing” coffee beans! Nice staff too!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Great coffee and baked goods (from neighbor bakehouse in Dogpatch that is amazing)! They have a take-out only option during COVID. I love that their disposable cups are completely compostable.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"The black coffee had a flavor profile of sub-specialty coffee, similar to a papery taste. Either the coffee they roasted was really stale, or not great quality."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Most expensive coffee shop I've been to in my entire life, and I live in this city. Cup of drip coffee from the thermos: $5, Latte: $6.75, and the beans *start at* $27 for 10oz. The pastry was $7 and at least a day old."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,love their latte. but lately 1/3 of large latte is mostly foam. I didn't drink a sip 5 minutes later 1/3 is gone. update : no more too foamy which is good!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Drip coffee spills over you as you drink it. Something with their coffee cups and lids. They also resell neighbourhood bakery pastries at much higher prices than other resellers.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Loved the café mocha. I’m gonna be back to try out more of their coffee flavours!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Excellent coffee! Coffee is amazing and the staff are super friendly. There is outdoor seating too. However, the line is too long during mornings and weekends. So, plan your visit!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Caught a stellar cappuccino this morning. Just excellent execution. They carry a really impressive array of beans from different locales using different processes including natural and honey. I always appreciate when roasters spend time curating beans from a variety of growers. Looking forward to picking up a couple bags soon.  If you’re into pastries, they stock from Neighbor bakehouse, which, in my humble opinion, is one of the top three bakeries in the bay."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Arguably best coffee in Potrero Hill. Now doing indoor orders. No seating indoors. Just outdoors.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Cashier is HORRIBLE! If you don’t want work than get another job. Don’t have an attitude early in the morning. Am paying for a service. If i want give a tip i will but don’t be rude and not show a tip jar. Since when the tip jar is underneath the counter??
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,These guys weren’t open yet likely on April but I happened to show up right when the owner was there and he was super friendly talked for a minute and gave me some free beans. He didn’t have to do anything except to say come back. This company seems to have a great hospitality and culture
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Daily coffee was fine but nothing noteworthy. Service was efficient. I’m
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Their lattes/espresso milk drinks are my top faves in the city. Very underrated. Tried their Ethiopian pour over too which was excellent. They also serve pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse which is super delicious!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,One of the best. Rotating selection of drip coffee using their beans. Great baked goods. Nice staff. Consistent quality. Highly recommend!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Great coffee and especially the iced mocha. Linea really is top quality and this location is rarely crowded except for Saturday mornings. It’s such a great community feel with the patio space. Can’t recommend more!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Unfortunately there was no seating option. The Mocha was okay, price a bit much!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Good coffee!  They are only open for take out. I would recommend the latte over the mocha. It is a bit overpriced compared to other local options.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Amazing coffee and friendly baristas!  But… there's always only one barista and 15 - 20 people in line. I understood during the height of Covid only having one barista because they only had a window that was open. Now the inside has been opened and still one barista?  Most of the time when I see the line I just don’t go there and go to Blue Bottle near by. A line of 7-8 peopleI shouldn't take 30 minutes.  Actually I thought to myself maybe they’re just creating the façade of being busy and popular to create buzz? Again, amazing coffee but the city has lots of amazing coffee options.  I buy their big bag of espresso coffee beans  to make at home. If they had a subscription of mail coffee I would totally sign up and skip the line.  Can they hire another barista to meet the demand?"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"We enjoyed a delicious oat milk cappuccino, hot chocolate, and carrot cake donut. I wouldn't have known the donut was gluten free if I hadn't read it on the checkout screen; it had a good texture and tasted great.  The customer service was also exceptional. I have a voice disorder and can't speak, so I type on my phone to communicate. Most of my retail experiences are negative because employees panic, don't read what I write, think I'm deaf (despite me writing that I'm mute), and so on. In contrast, the barista here read properly, treated me normally, asked follow up questions in a way that was easy for me to reply to, and was patient while I signed with my partner to discuss our order before it was finalized. It was really refreshing."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"As an espresso drinker, preferring a more ristretto style pull, I regularly drink here and thoroughly enjoy it. I find myself going several times a week now even though it is a good ten minute drive. Yummy."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Some of the best coffee I have EVER had. My only wish is that they had a cozier sitting area.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"I’d defs come again, great americano, great caffeine, great service :)"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Awesome new coffee shop! Got an oat milk cappuccino and some yummy treats. Check them out! :)
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"This SF roaster has just hit the top go to spot for my beans. It's now a balance between grabbing a bags here and having my Kona Peaberry shipped, when in season, from the big island by a small roaster near a place I stay while out there.  My espresso game has changed and of the 2 out of 3 bags I've tried so far it's been sooo much better than any of the beans from Whole Foods, Rainbow Grocery, Other Avenues CoOp, Red Bay Roasters, Jeremiah's Picks, Starbucks, or Peet's.  Reminds me of an old school roaster that has not been in SF for over 2 decades, Has Beans, which used to have a small cafe on Valencia and then up the way a huge wharehouse that freshly roasted the beans.  I had driven by them for almost an entire year while working the area and finally on my last day popped in and grabbed a few bags and a cuppa coffee. I'll be back!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Coffee was alright, but very expensive  No seating inside, just coffee and pastries to-go"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Linea consistently makes high quality espresso based drinks and serves up delicious pastries. The addition of outdoor seating is a welcome addition in spring 2021. My personal favorite drink is their mocha made with oat milk!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"The coffee quality is great, and their pastries are from neighbor bakehouse. On some days of the week, they also have bagels from midnite bagels. They have some of the best beans in SF and they sometimes have a ~50% off sale."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Great coffee with alternative milk options. Roasts their own beans and makes some pretty great blends, I love the Little Wing personally. Carries pastries from a local bakery that are also great. Currently it's a lovely walk up window but the area is without any seating and few decent bike parking options nearby."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,This place sucks. With all the places in the city skip this shop. I spent $10 on coffee they wouldn’t let me take my 5 year old to use the restroom in which i clearly saw.  This is illegal to serve food and not let customers use the restroom.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,This coffee shop will blow your mind! One of the best oat milk latte experiences ever!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Very cool staff great coffee great snacks not abnormal pricing. Only wish coffee shops offered larger coffees but they sure are good
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"We love Linea! Great coffee, matcha, and selection of the best pastries in sf (Dynamo Donuts, Neighborhood bake house, and of course Midnight bagels.) All of the employees are so kind and we love supporting this local business. They also recently built a lovely parklet outside."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Best beans, best customer service, and best company. I’ve ordered from Linea’s twice now and both times they have gone out of their way to answer all my coffee questions and make sure I am receiving the appropriate beans ground to perfection! They are seriously the best!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Coffee is good for a to go order but they only do outdoor seating which makes it hard to use the spot as a meet up place
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Ohhhhh you saved the 2020 by opening the coffee shop! Thank you! We were usually just buying beans (which are great) but now we can buy beans and have our morning routine of grabbing a great coffee in the neighborhood :lovely:!  Great customer service, great pastries, ultra-good coffee!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Best cappuccino in Mission/Mission Bay/Potrero/Dog Patch. Great drop coffee and coffee beans. Great croissants from 3rd Street Neighborhood Bakehouse.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Coffee tastes amazing. Never disappointed. However, lines are always way too long & I just feel like there could be a better way to manage the crowd."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Bougie goodness, whether it be quality coffee or tasty pastries. During pandemic, the line is out along the sidewalk, but there's plenty of eye candy facing out from the windows to keep you entertained."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Most expensive coffee I ever bought but delicious.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Outstanding coffee here! Great service too and the pastries and donuts are delicious. Worth queuing for and it’s a lovely spot to then chill on the parklet next to it after.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Always excellent cappuccinos! The baristas there are friendly and make great coffee - best in Potrero hill for sure!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"This opened during COVID so we haven’t had a chance to visit the inside, but the staff is always so friendly and nice, and the coffees/lattes always tastes flavorful and spot on. One of my favorite coffee places in Potrero/Dogpatch area."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Nice new coffee shop. Currently using 80% Brazilian beans and 20% Ethiopian for their espresso based drinks. I prefer Central American but still good!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"They make a great cup of coffee and if they've got the curry potato puff pastry, do yourself a favor and get one. Just delicious."
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Somehow the coffee isnt as good as the mission location. I’m confused lol
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,First stop from sfo
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,"Great coffee, friendly staff, and pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse. Perfect!"
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,They are now available for walk up service at a window and have amazing pasteries from Neighbor Bakehouse - savory and sweet! On the weekends they have donuts from Dynamo donuts (with vegan options). Their oat milk cappuccinos are delicious! 👌 …
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Favourite coffee shop in the neighbourhood and coffee bean go to place!
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Thrilled there’s a new coffee shop in the neighborhood! Our matcha latte & cappuccino was excellent. The matcha wasn’t too sweet if it’s even sweetened at all. They also had a small selection of baked goods from Neighbor Bakehouse & donuts from Dynamo. Will definitely be returning on a regular basis.
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Great spot and glad they finally opened the cafe up. Also you can’t beat getting a free house coffee when you buy a bag of beans 👌🏻 …
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,$5.50 for a cappuchino? There's too much good coffee in this city for $1-2 less than that
Linea Coffee Roasting + Caffe,1125 Mariposa St,Great coffee shop. Loved the flat white and outdoor seating.
