Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Ok, so I used to live in Europe. I'm sure like many of you whom have traveled and returned from France I too embarked on an epic yet fruitless search for the croissant I had at Maison d'isabelle or Terrior d'Avenir just to find that no such place existed.  For reals, I just had a flashback to when i lived in Neufchatel. Idk who they're working with all of the sudden but their croissant game just went from averages Joe's bar right to easy top 3 I the city. I say top 3 because I haven't tried them all but for me, I haven't had better this side of the Atlantic.  Also, their espresso is darn good too lol. Croissant game on fire. Layers upon layers of butter and crispy flakey goodness...."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"The three sisters, Bonnie, Pisey, Rath, make a family atmosphere of the bistro, but the sandwiches are fresh and excellently made too! Very well priced! The pastrami on toasted sourdough ($8.95) and the egg, cheese, bacon on toasted everything bagel ($6.95) are our favorites, but my wife and I've tried pretty much their whole menu. All well made and fresh ingredients! We eat brunch here and the regulars are many, attesting to its quality and good chill vibe. Kinda like Cheers but with good sandwiches ❤"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"This cafe is very nearly perfect - great atmosphere, great breakfast bagel, great service. The baristas know how to make a real cappuccino.  The one problem I have is simply that I do not prefer the taste of their espresso beans - I like a lighter, more acidic bean.  This means I'll remain a customer of other coffee shops in the area - Home Coffee Roasters and Coffee Movement are great options if you want a more elevated cup.  But I will definitely be coming back here!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Wow absolutely loved this place. Cute vibe, friendly staff, great menu with reasonable prices. I stopped by here to get some work done and was happy to have found this place that offered wifi. Wifi is clearly posted and the connection was great for me. I got a cappuccino and a mushroom quiche and the quiche was very tasty. They also offer things like sandwiches. The barista was nice and made sure I connected to the wifi ok. 10/10 recommend this place to get some work done or to enjoy a nice coffee/meal"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Nice oat chais and muffins, with a pretty solid breakfast bagel."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"We ordered hot cappuccino, cafe latte, and Club royal sandwich. All of them are so perfect. This place makes me feel very warm with kind and energetic baristas."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Cons. 1. Coconut coffee($4.77) is the worst. Just bitter and very light. It is almost disgusting. 2. Tables were dirty with bread crusts. 3. The owner talks too loudly and cuts customers world off. 4. Tables were not stable so we had to fix it by ourselves.
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"One of the best cafés I’ve been to in SF. Great coffee, great food, great staff. The ambience and vibe is amazing.They put a lot of effort into making sure they give the best of what you ordered and it shows."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Great place to sit down and enjoy a coffee beverage. Love the no frills and relaxed ambiance. It's a good change of gear for when you need a break from the more craft agenda heavy shops without sacrifice of decent espresso drinks.
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"This is a decent little coffee shop. They offer the classics and specialty drinks too, they also had things like an Arnold Palmer and hot apple cider which you can't get at every coffee place. The food selection was pretty good, also. There's a good verity of breakfast and lunch sandwiches."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"The staff here are so kind, they really care about their customers. I recommend this place to everyone who asks for a good coffee/ breakfast place. Very comfortable seating and lighting. Always brings a smile to my face when I walk in."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Your ultimate neighborhood cafe! Affordable, opens conveniently early, offers a variety of drinks and pastries, and has some of the friendliest staff!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Amazing place with great coffee, i tried egg and cheese sandwich and it was awesome"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Mediocre coffee with poor customer service. The staff didn’t even pause to listen to the request and ended up giving us not what we wanted and wouldn’t even listen to us explain more. The latte we ended up with was almost all milk and no flavor or espresso. Would pick a different place next time.
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Love this place! They have the best staff and a very great spot for locals as well as people passing through, who are looking for an authentic SF experience at a ma n pa shop. Great prices and delicious lox bagel!! One of my favorite in the city. Also love their dirty chai and cappuccino."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Ladies behind the counter are super nice and welcoming! I love this small cafe and have been here 3 times now. I love the Americano and the bagel veggie special. So delicious! Prices are decent compared to other coffee shops in the city. I heard the women behind the counter even greet guests by their names and knew their orders, this just shows how nice they are!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Excellent coffee, sandwiches, smoothies, and service.  The women who work there are friendly, fast, know everyone’s name and regular orders.  I live a few blocks away; I say   “I’m going to my friends” when I go for my daily latte /smoothie and sandwich.  My 30+ yr old daughter and her friends, who don’t live in the area, now come here for their morning lattes and bagels.  I usually meet clients there for lunch because the we are not disturbed or rushed.  They follow covid rules strictly, so you give your order and they bring to you outside.  During covid and now there are nice bistro tables outside to eat at.  For me, it’s home but with much better coffee (and company 😏)"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"I simply love this place. The simplicity, the sweetest people and amazing coffee!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Have had simple bagels around the city for 15 years, probably some of the best bagels of coffee shops in the city just counting production quality. (2022.7.28)"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Delicious food and coffee, good value, clean atmosphere, friendly staff"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Five stars for the service alone! The staff are extremely welcoming. I tend to come here on weekends when I'm leaving the city, and need to get something to eat. Their breakfast sandwiches are simple, yet delicious. And they come out quickly too.  They also have Thai iced tea, which is great for me because I have cravings now and then. It's freshly made, and I can order it with almond milk.  There's lots of seating inside, and wifi is available.  One morning I ordered my coffee ""for here,"" but my ride came unexpectedly early, so I asked if I could get a paper cup to go. I don't really like doing that since they use mugs for those drinking in their cafe, so using a paper cup plus washing the mug are added costs. But they obliged and were cool about it.  And I like the music. It's relaxing, and I feel like I'm away from the hustle and bustle of the city."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Great food and amazing staff! I have been coming here close to 4 years now since I moved to this area and this is my go to spot. Don't let the neigh sayers divert you.
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"I went in for just a hot drink before work and ended up also buying a second breakfast. The lady who works here is so welcoming and friendly. Walking in to the shop feels like walking in to your favorite aunts house. The one who always has the good drinks and the baked goods. The next two people in line (socially distanced) were greeted by name, which means it’s a popular neighborhood spot. This is one of those little hole in the wall gems in SF that you really only find bc a friend has been going there for years tells you about."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Without a doubt the best place in the area. I rarely rate places, but this place has great, strong espresso and coffee. Also best prices for bagels in area."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Remarkably good coffee, excellent cappuccino, and croissants even a Frenchman would love. Small and cozy with sidewalk seating. Nice selection of brunch bagels and sandwiches. Free WiFi. Funky, slightly bohemian - vibe operated by very friendly sisters from SE Asia."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Loveliest spot in the Richmond for a Sunday coffee. Owner knows everyone by name, just overall good vibes and tasty drinks."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Best coffee shop in the district.  Fantastic service, clean, friendly, positive, tasty.  After first posting this review, I decided to visit more coffee shops in the district.  Most my work is remote.  Hands down, this is the best coffee shop in the Outer Richmond.  What sets apart is the people.  This is a family owned and operated business, and the pride shows!  Royal Grounds is a place where locals go, and it provides a unique and authentic view into one of SF's most interesting neighborhoods.  The only one on the area that gets 5 stars from me!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Great little coffee shop with a regular flow of customers but not too busy or crowded. Good wifi connection. They serve Mighty Leaf and Stash teas with your normal coffee options. Pastries and bagels/sandwiches available. Veggie bagel was pretty good. Basic while fresh. Very friendly baristas! They know their customers by name :)
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"This is my favorite place in the city. I make sure any house guests take a walk over to this place and start their day off right. The people are the best part. The staff here does an incredible job of making everyone feel welcome. Winky has a ridiculously good memory so she always knows what you want -perfect for groggy mornings when you don’t want to think. When it comes to the food, absolutely everything is off the chain delicious.  Between my roommates and I, we’ve tried everything and it never fails to result in mouth-gasms. The everything bagel makes everything better and the soy lattes are just like rainbows and butterflies in a cup. Only problem is that it’s not open 24 hours."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Amazing coffee, amazing food, and amazing staff that are so friendly and go above and beyond. I just moved to the neighborhood and this has become my favorite coffee shop, I haven’t even bothered to try anywhere else!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Best breakfast bagels and coffee! Very cozy and good service! More of a local vibes.
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,The best neighborhood cafe in the area.  The owners are wonderful and know all their regulars- both their orders and their life stories.  The food is delicious and the drinks are great (I highly recommend stopping in for a chai and a bagel on a cold morning- it'll warm you up quick)
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Decent coffee and amazing service. These people are the homies and will make you feel right at home. Fast wifi and chatty patrons will keep you entertained. If you see a parking officer, notify everyone around to top up their meters."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Lovely staff; best place to get some work done
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,I really enjoyed having breakfast and a chai latte here. They had so many options for chai flavors. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. It was just a good vibe here. My ham and cheese croissant was also very good.
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"I was out jogging nearby and I fell and cut my hand. I went inside and asked if I could use their hand sanitizer, and the barista (owner?) was incredibly kind. She was concerned whether I was okay and then she went out of her way to run to the back to grab bandages and gave me napkins, offered me water etc. It was above and beyond, and really lifted me up. These are the type of small businesses that contribute so much to a community and we need to support them! Please go to Royal Ground Coffee, they are great!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"With so many cafes in SF to choose from, you're going to want to go to this one if you're in the neighborhood. The owners, Rickki and Kevin, are very friendly and so attentive they remembered my drink the second time I visited. The Cafe Mocha is amazing. The place has an attractive atmosphere, neither too chi-chi nor too slick/cold/modern. It's no wonder that a steady stream of regulars patronizes this place. After your coffee, take a stroll to Green Apple Books on Clement and Sixth."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Affordable prices, kind staff. Lots of bagel sandwich options including lots of veggies, egg, and cheese!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,Wow. Just randomly popped in here for a coffee and was floored by the friendliness and quality of service.

Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,By far my favorite coffee shop! Anything I’ve ever eaten here was delicious and made fresh. The service is fantastic and the girls running the place are the best feature! I just wish they were open a bit later :) Also they have free WiFi
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Good good sandwiches ! Plus clean bathroom and strong wifi signal. I had the vegetarian sandwich and it came on toasted sourdough bread , had globs of avocado, and a bunch of sprouts as well. All for $6! Delicious."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Small little coffee shop, comfortable and quiet to get work done. Coffee to bagels/sandwiches, easy to locate, friendly workers, have a great memory of the orders if you are their regular customer."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"Coffee, pastries, and sandwiches are all good and at a solid price. My personal preference of cafe. Plus it's got a nice quiet atmosphere inside. Good place on a rainy/foggy day. Very friendly baristas."
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,"As soon as you enter it smells wonderfully like good food and most importantly, coffee drinks.  Exceptionally friendly service too.  Thank you!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2342 Clement St,The staff here is friendly but the quality and portion of the grilled cheese chicken sandwich was not worth 8.87 after tax!  The chicken was diced and didn't hold the small sandwich!
