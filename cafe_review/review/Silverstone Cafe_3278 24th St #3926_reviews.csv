Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I like coming here often. They know my usual coffee order by now lol. Nice place to meet with friends for coffee and light eating.
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,"When I am visiting the SF Mission District, I usually stop off at Silverstone Cafe for a snack and coffee. The Cafe has some unique features such as an option to order a fresh juice, seafood tostada, and handmade to order sandwiches. The Cafe has a beautiful burl wood mantle that was removed from a bar in the Mission District. The owner is very friendly and comfortable to speak with. Today while visiting, I was given a cup of water that was saved from Superbowl 50. The Cafe also has a great rear outdoor patio . If you have an opportunity, I recommend a visit to Silverstone Cafe."
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,"Visited here for breakfast to grab Bagel with cream cheese and a latte. Good service, pretty good bagel and latte. Restrooms were clean. Good place for quick breakfast."
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,"Silverstone Cafe is located in the middle of a lot of good authentic mexican restaurants. I liked this place’s coffee and the prices were very reasonable throughout. The service was good, the guy behind the counter was very attentive and helpful."
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,"This place is my new favorite locally/family owned cafe. The food is fantastic, the people are so kind, and the place itself is beautiful. They have tons of options for any diet and the service was super fast. The space is clean and welcoming, and the walls are decorated with beautiful art and murals. The location is super convenient (literally next door to BART), and they even have an outdoor patio. I got a bagel with cream cheese and a blended coffee, and they we're both absolutely fantastic. The bagel was toasted to perfection, and the coffee was great. Overall, this place is awesome, and adorable, and I will be recommending it to everyone I know regardless if they ask or not."
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,"The espresso was amazing! It was smooth as silk but also full-bodied. The atmosphere was a bit lacking, which is why it only gets four stars. We were in the area initially to try Grand Coffee, but they had no sitting (which was not mentioned in the reviews) and was more pricey than we expected, so we continued walking around the corner and found this gem."
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,Customer service is very amigable. Great coffee and coffee cake
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,The people who work here are super sweet. The mocha is good. Basic good food. Fresh fruit. & they make smoothies. Chill space with seating.
Silverstone Cafe,3278 24th St #3926,"A basic low end coffee shop in the Mission Dist. Even though this review is mixed I will say I have coffee here 3-4 times a week.  The bad: If you are looking for trendy then look elsewhere, the Batista's are NOT trained, the do not tamp their espresso grounds in the portafilter, they just pour in the grounds and jam it in the machine. Their drip is a mix of 4 different types of grounds (Batista told me this). Basically terrible coffee lol. Come here only for cheep drinks and the chill atmosphere.  The good: They open up at 5:30am 7 days a week (or close to it), Staff and owner are SUPER nice, they are never busy in the morning no matter what day of the week it is (a big plus for me), it is clean, they have a GREAT patio, decent WiFi, fresh fruit for sale, some cute prints on the walls, a very spacious floor plan, good place to go if you don't want to stand in line or want to work on your lappy in peace.  So even though I only gave it 3 stars I love this place. The stars are because of the lack of care put into what is the main product they are pushing (coffee). If they upped their coffee game (stopped mixing grounds, offer a couple different roasts and actually trained the Batista's on espresso production) this would be a great coffee shop."
