Cafe 450,450 Golden Gate Ave,"Cafe with small, but reasonably priced selection and expansive seating area.  The seating area is about as wide as the cafe and makes an L shape around it. The cafe itself isn't very impressive and doesn't have a lot of options, but there's a decent selection of food and drinks. It's not stocked full of food, but seems to be stocked just enough for the number of customers. I came here around lunchtime and there were only about ten people in the cafe including the staff and security person. I bought the seasonal fruit salad, which was very fresh and had a variety of fruit. It was also just over $4, so very reasonably priced and cheaper than fruit salads from Safeway, Target, or 7-Eleven.  Overall, the service was good and the food was great. Even though there are plenty of cafes and restaurants near the building, it's a great place to get food without needing to go through the hassle of security."
Cafe 450,450 Golden Gate Ave,Located inside the Phillip burton federal building this cafe is convenient for people who need to be at the building all day or people who work there. They have so many options for food. Like in the morning I got myself a donut my parents French toast. In the afternoon I got my vegetarian mom a vegetarian sandwich which she really enjoyed my dad a turkey sandwich and myself a chicken sandwich. They were really big sandwiches and the price matched the proportion. I really enjoyed the food here. You can also lounge around on the chairs outside the cafe. Perfect waiting spot.
Cafe 450,450 Golden Gate Ave,"I made an order and waited there for most of my lunch (about 25-30 minutes). Finally I went up and asked if my order was ready yet, and they said that someone else must have taken the food that I ordered (which may or may not be true). I had to scarf down my food to finish my lunch in time. It will be at least a couple months before I give this place another go."
