Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"I had my first visit to Compton’s Coffeehouse at the recommendation of a friend.  I rarely leave a place thinking, “Oh I HAVE to leave a review”, but here we are. The coffee was excellent, the atmosphere welcoming but omg the staff was so friendly and kind. Thank you. ☕️. I’ll be back for sure."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Found this coffee ☕️  shop after watching suntise. It is a nice local little coffee shop. Looks like many are regular and live in neighborhood. Service was quick. The latte is not that strong. Pastries are yummy. It is pet friendly coffee shop.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Honestly pretty average coffee with a cashier that really didn’t want to be there. I asked if the matcha latte had any expresso and they said it did not, which is contrary to what I thought so I paid an extra $1.00 for one shot. Got the latte and it didn’t hit any expectations well. It wasn’t that hot, it had just a bit of matcha taste (for what the dark green color looked like, it should have had more matcha flavor) and it didn’t even taste like there was coffee in it.  Also it’s alright for a single person to work from but the tables aren’t really for having more than one person at each"
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Medium roast single origin. Coffee was slightly bitter = medium Barrister. Overall if you look for an exciting coffee experience then this is probably not your place. But ok to stop by.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Had a cold brew and lavender latte. Both were good! Lavender latte was a bit sweet for me. I’ll probably have it less sweet next time.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,The bacon cheddar scone was kinda trash but the hot americano was one of the best I’ve had in a while! I came for the coffee so the pastry was whatever.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Great coffee. And very reasonable prices too. Service with a large smile and quick too. Clean restroom as well for the weary tourists. Didn't try any food items though.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Excellent Service. Delicious Coffee. Great Environment. Worth It. ♡♡♡  Yummy Treats, Try The Banana Bread. ♡ The 'Indulgent Brownie' is A Bit Over Priced for The Size. I would call it a 2.50. Cheers."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,What a lovely place for coffee and pastries in the neighborhood. My standard black coffee and either the vegetarian or bacon scone are highly recommended. My only issues is that it had become a hangout for the remote workers so getting a seat to enjoy quiet moment with your coffee and treat can be challenging. Parklets have been replaced with a couple tables and chairs.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Chill spot with friendly staff, decent coffee and small pastries. They have outdoor parklets if the weather permits. The inside seating ain’t made for parties but has comfy seat pads.  Wifi if you are looking to hang for a little bit. Water bottles available for purchase with a few other random drinks."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Really yummy bacon croissants! Great service everyone us very chill. Love the red mugs for the in-store orders
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Had a quad capp and it was undrinkable. Really bad, under extracted shots of espresso - leaving an extra star bc friend had a vanilla latte that was far better."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Incredible experience. Owner operated which makes a huge difference. Fillmore St has more than its fair share of chains making it especially nice to have this independent shop. Good coffee, good seating (indoor and outdoor) and friendly staff."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,One of the best flat whites I have had in the US of A. Smooth and flavorful.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"A very trendy and modern little coffee shop surrounding by tons of things to do in San Francisco! We drove here from our hotel and found parking quite quickly for the morning. It was only a few minutes to japantown from there, so we fed the meters on very little quarters happily and had breakfast !!  Super quick service, a good selection of both classic and unique drinks, with delicious bakery items that taste fresh and flaky!!  One downside is they do not put lids on the cups, they supply them, but with how full the cups are, a mess is inevitable."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"A really cozy cafe that allows customers to stay both indoor and outdoor seating. The oat milk latte I ordered was good and I like the rich flavor of the espresso which would not be covered by the flavor of oat milk. Last but not least, it's perfect if you want to work here. They offer free and high-speed wifi here."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"I loved this place and would’ve given it 5 stars before I learned it was opened by my favorite barista, Aidan, from Peet’s on Chestnut. I wish there was a 6 star option. The staff are friendly, the coffee is good, and I love the space! I learned today that they make their own vanilla and lavender syrup— here’s a pic of them being “caught in the act” of vanilla syrup making… check out those vanilla beans!"
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"crisp, clean and friendly aesthetic. the two staff members were super sweet and helpful. it’s a cute place to grab coffee with a friend or even get some work done. i got a peppermint ice tea and was not disappointed, i would highly recommend.  the barista mentioned others who come by here to get work done. although it’s a small space, there’s quite a bit of indoor and outdoor seating. the seating toward the back on the long table has outlets."

Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"The coffee is great, of course, but the people working here went above and beyond to have good customer service. When I mentioned to my partner that I would share my coffee with them, they offered to split it into two cups. That's never happened before and I really appreciated it."
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Very good coffee any always so great to have it in a real cup not paper. Super friendly service as well.
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"I was so happy find a small, local, & family owned coffee shop within a short walk from UCSF Mt. Zion.   I ordered my go to midday pick-me-up: a dirty chai with oat milk. The chai they use is mildly spicy and is perfect with a shot of espresso and oatly oatmilk which gives it a touch of sweetness.  I'll definitely be back for my lunch breaks!"
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,Adorable independent coffee shop in lower pacific heights. Friendly staff & delicious coffee & pastries. Stop by to support new small businesses in the city. It’s take courage to start a business at this time.

Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"The dessert that I ordered tasted like the frosting was made from margarine instead of butter. It feels heavy instead of a light texture when you eat it. But I went there mainly for coffee, so I had three cups. Not obviously coffee addict, kidding aside. No sugar just plain coffee, and I enjoyed them all. I had a great time here!"
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,We tried each of the seasonal drinks and they were both terrific iced. Definitely a great treat for our day of walking around the neighborhood. And the employee who helped us was dressed as Gene Belcher for Halloween so it was a lovely touch to see someone taking Halloween seriously. :)
Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Cute little caffee for a morning or evening coffee! Prices are reasonable, servers are helpful and nice!"

Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"This is the single most delicious vanilla latte I’ve had in my entire life.  I’ve been drinking coffee for 28 years.  No trace of bitterness covered by too much sweetness.  Lightly sweet, slightly frothy, perfect amount of ice. Like sipping heaven."

Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Update : now they have real cups for the coffee. So much more enjoyable than paper. #ReusableSF  Just had a chance to try the new coffee shop I'm the neighborhood.  In spite of it being afternoon, we had cappuccinos, and of course we had to sample the baked goods (start with classics, a cinnamon twist and a blueberry muffin).  Conclusion: these folks know what they're doing. Haven't had any muffin this good in a long time, the cinnamon twist had great texture and was not too sweet or too cinnamony. Cappuccinos were as good as any I've had, and better than most. Nice addition to the neighborhood."

Compton’s Coffee House,1910 Fillmore St,"Comptons is one of the only places I trust to make a good almond milk latte. As non-dairy folk, it’s hard to find lattes that don’t taste too bitter/burnt... but Aidan and everyone at the shop do a SUPER job! Delicious drinks and really fine coffee beans. Highly recommend!!"
