Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Perfect spot downtown for some grab and go breakfast in the morning. Very friendly small business with great coffee and quick turn around times. In and out every morning in less than 5 minutes. Covered pick up area in case of weather.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Best little place for a breakfast sandwich in the FiDi. Service is super friendly (unnervingly so considering where it is in sf), and food is simple and delicious. Highly recommend the giant corned beef sandwich, then skip lunch."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"The croissant sandwich was very good, but beware of the price hike. It's nearly twice as much as some of the pictures suggest! Not such a good price-to-experience ratio anymore. Adding a recent photo of the menu, as of August 2021"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Great place to get a fantastic breakfast sandwich in the Financial District.  So tasty!  And the hot chocolate and chai tea were amazing.  Wish I would have found this place at the start of my trip.  I would have grabbed breakfast here every day.  And the people working there were extremely friendly.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Last morning on biz travel and needed some Java and found this small little cafe.   The owner was super nice and explained how he researched the local SF roasters and chose the one he did before he opened.   BETTER than Peete’s and Starbucks.  $2.75 for a large.   Gourmet coffee with exceptional taste and flavor.  👍🏻
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Coffee Is Garbage Not Sugar When You Ask For Sugar He Give You 2 Small Packs Only Egg Sandwich Is Good
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Cute little hidden breakfast sandwich place! Highly recommend!!!!
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Friendly and quick. Nice little spot and the coffee is good.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Great breakfast sandwiches, nice service, quick and easy!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Great little place. The prices are fair and the food is delicious.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Great place for a quick breakfast sandwich! I had the bacon egg and cheese croissant with iced coffee and it really hit the spot. I work in the same building so it’s really great for a quick breakfast if I’m running late. The staff are super friendly too.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Fast, no frills, and great breakfast sandwiches for on the go!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Great Place, small little gem around FIDI Staff is super friendly. Must try."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Super amazing gem tucked away in the Financial District with the most delicious and fresh breakfast options. You really can't go wrong with any of the menu options....and they do have something for everyone! Also the coffee is a nice dark roast. These are hard working friendly people running a fantastic cafe with just the right energy to start the day.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Not 5 star worthy, but good nonetheless. The food is fresh and the service is great! I should have been more adventurous but I played it safe by getting a turkey and egg breakfast sandwich on wheat. It wasn't greasy, and the egg was cooked to perfection!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,The hype is real!  I've been staying at a hotel nearby and try to find a new breakfast spot each morning.  This is THE spot!  It's a small little shop run by very friendly and efficient people.  The breakfast sandwiches come out quick so you're in and out. There's no indoor seating but plenty of tables outside in the courtyard.   Simple.  Fast.  Delicious.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Bagels are on par with a cheap supermarket brand. Service is rude. The cashier insisted on entering the tip himself, after turning the screen away from me."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"We picked up a sausage, egg, and cheese muffin and a bacon, egg, and cheese croissant to have for breakfast at our hotel. Both were very yummy! The lady who takes orders is the sweetest! There was a short line, but these guys are very efficient. Great quick breakfast find!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Line was out the door and for good reason. With an amazing selection of great breakfast sandwiches and fresh coffee at a great price point, it's clear this is a great local spot which keeps people coming back. They run a tight ship behind the counter with orders constantly being yelled back to the cooks and then out the window to you when your order is done. The lady behind the counter is probably the nicest person on earth. If you don't crack a smile when you talk to her, I would be surprised. Minimal seating in the courtyard but that's okay since it seems like most people are taking their orders to go. The bagel and lox sandwich was great!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Fantastic food and coffee. Great place to grab early morning breakfast. The staff was very friendly.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Walked here from Union Square area for breakfast to find them closed. Important info to post online.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Small little spot hidden by office buildings. great place to get some breakfast sandwiches early in the morning. The lady who takes your order is super friendly and they work quite fast.  They open early and tend to shut down by 2 pm. So, if you want to get a sandwich for lunch be sure to get there by like 1:45ish so they still have the kitchen going."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Was staying at Hilton Financial District. Wanted easy but good breakfast and this place delivered. Breakfast sandwiches made from scratch, full coffee bar, and great, friendly service. Definitely recommend!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"What an amazing surprise!  This little out of the way walk up cafe is hosted by the most friendly and sincere couple, and the food is quick, affordable and great.  Forget about Starbucks! Go here for coffee and breakfast!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Ran inside of what seems to be a closet.  A friendly couple with delicious sandwiches and coffee for what only could be described in San Fran as ""dirt cheap"".  Ate breakfast here on the way to an Alcatraz tour.  It was a cute little place and I would go again."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Yum! Great little breakfast place! Quick, friendly, and great price. Perfect for me and my two young kids. Be warned there is only a little outdoor seating, though, if you are looking for a sit down place."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,It is a small place but the food and service is huge!  Wow! What a find!!  The owner is so friendly and really cares about the product you are getting.

Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"MMMmmmm. Needed a small, hearty breakfast within walking distance of our hotel; enter Cafe Me. Small kitchen serving delicious breakfast sandwiches is an accurate description of Cafe Me. Place is sandwiched in the middle of the building, a bit closer to Sansome St. If all you need is a quick bite, made fresh, and a cup of coffee, I recommend Cafe Me."
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,Everything you want and need from an informal  breakfast pick up spot. Most sandwiches under 5$. Great combos under 5$. Fast and polite service. This could easily be a part of your morning routine.
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"Good little place, cheap, quick and food was good!"
Cafe Me,500 Washington St,"I bought a lox bagel and they charge me for the tomatoes and cucumbers. That is standard on a lox bagel, not extra. Everyone knows that, I you want to make more money just up your prices. There is no need for hidden charges. And the lox bagel sucks."
