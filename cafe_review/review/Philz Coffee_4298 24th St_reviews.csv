Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"I just finished a 5k race for the San Francisco Marathon and decided to get an Iced Coffee Rosé. It is a delightful blend with a subtle and lovely floral note that complements the creamy cold brew perfectly. The baristas provided excellent service, and the inviting ambiance made the experience enjoyable. The unique flavor makes it worth trying. Looking forward to returning for more!"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Fantastic service, cozy shop, great coffee. Team members are clearly having a great time and are super nice."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Picked up Philz Coffee before exploring San Francisco - Neo Valley. The morning and the weather was overwhelmingly beautiful. The service we received was wonderful. This was my first time having Philz Coffee so I ordered their Ginger Snap Iced Coffee - very tasty. Definitely woke me up.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Great coffee shop with parklet selling clothing in addition to food and drinks.  This coffee shop was slightly crowded when I visited. I didn't have to wait long to order and got a medium ""Iced Coffee Rosé,"" house way, for $5.95. While waiting for my drink, I looked at the shirts and hats they were selling. Some items were on sale and half-priced. The coffee was wonderful. It had a subtle rose flavor and was very creamy. It was sweet, but not too sweet so I could taste the coffee. Also, there was a clean bathroom and plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. The staff were helpful and polite throughout my visit. Overall, it was a good experience and I would visit again. If you get there later in the afternoon and want to sit down, keep in mind that it the location closes at 5:00 p.m. and the parklet seats are reserved for Firefly (the restaurant on 24th St. next to Philz Coffee) at that time."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Love the Douglass location. Barista asked me to taste to “make sure it’s perfect” which took me back to their 18th st location back in the 2010s. .
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Who doesn't love to grab a Pete's before you go do life. This location is a little quieter and has outdoor seating which is nice. It's across the street from a playground if you have little ones that need running around
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"I'm inclined to not like philz because of its preciousness, but the pour over was delicious. I'm not sure why they can't make the drinks a bit faster or buy a gallon of whole milk for us who like it, but that's just Philz."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,I used to come here almost daily but they must have new staff. Every coffee is either all watered down or there's 30 leaves of mint in it that make it undrinkable. There's such a long wait that it's impossible to have them redone as well sadly.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Awesome Coffee, definitely not a sugar and cream type of place. But if that's what you like they can add it!"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Perfect place for a snack and a coffee! I got their iced green tea and it was refreshing on a Sunday. My friend got the ginger iced tea and it was super flavorful! Also one of the best banana breads I've ever had.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Excellent coffee and superior customer service. I will definitely be back!
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Super friendly staff with excellent coffee. For the uninitiated, Philz only does pour over coffee. You won't find espresso drinks here, but trust me it's okay. Their coffee is so, so good."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,A great place if your in the neighborhood to grab a good cup of coffee! Staff are kind and lots of great seating.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Typical Philz with way less hectic traffic. Enjoyed an avocado toast and jacobs wunderbar on a rainy day.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Goid coffee. Not a friendly kids place, even been located right in front of a playground, nobody cares, not even say good morning. I said twice thank you, nobody cares."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Mint mojito is really awesome! You should get this one as a large size!
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"It always has been a good spot to get coffee in the mornings,  for 40 years I've been doing that,  the multiple varieties  of coffee beans from around the world  brings a smile to your palate"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Once you've been to Philz coffee you know what to expect! Exceptional no-nonsense coffee brewed one cup at a time. I decided to check out this location because it is closer to my house. I liked it, but it is a lot smaller than the Mission location so you may not be able to grab a seat so easily. The employees are wonderful and super knowledgeable about the coffee. They'll help you decide what to get if you feel you need assistance. I got the mocha this time. It was the first time I had Philz mocha and I got it lightly sweet. It was pure heaven! As always, a great spot to work from home or to study or surf the net when you need to get out of you're own home!"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"I love this Philz! Happy Place. Thank you, Edwin! You are AWESOME!"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Very good coffee!
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Good coffee, with a very reasonable and safe outdoor / curb side pickup setup adopted during covid. The app can be a pain, but you can always sign up under a different email if something gets messed up - mine got screwed up so bad I had to use an alternative phone number too which was annoying. Still this place makes good coffee and that makes it still a winner even with some app hick-ups (I did forget my password) also it's a coffee shop, not a development studio.  Note this place is for fresh made brewed coffee, not espresso drinks. They have fancy stuff like mint and make drinks to even fussy specifications, but black is generally best in my opinion (though added mint for Turkish is awesome). Tessora is a good starting point if you're not sure about your first cup."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"The philharmonic tastes like hot water in a cup. And please stop putting mint in people’s coffee, the flavor gets absorbed and destroys the coffee. Spent $ on ground coffee that I can’t even use because it does nothing for me, supposed to be medium roast but little caffeine and again tastes like water straight up."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,The best coffee I had in SF.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Not bad coffee for those that like drip / filter coffee (not my taste) however hardest ordering system ever. Who puts the till at the entrance to then make you walk down to the barista, order, then walk back to pay, wait, then walk back to pick up the coffee? Needs the customer experience re-designed asap. Also wait is long and cups drip."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Love Philz coffee ☕️
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Philz' special drip process produces phenomenal coffee, smooth and complex like you have never had before. Seriously. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Better value and vastly superior product than any large coffee chain could hope to offer."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Got the ""Philtered Soul"", and enjoyed the flavor and  smoothness of this cup of coffee. I did find the ordering process a bit confusing.  I ordered from the barista and then was directed down the counter to pay at the register by the door I entered through. Then, directed back to the barista to pick up my coffee.  Would have been easier to visit the register first, instead of everyone ordering and waiting for their coffees in the same small area at the back of the room."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Great spot for great coffee. Service was attentive and friendly. Pour over style coffee can take a bit longer but it's SO worth it. We will be hitting up this place alot while we're here. Wish we had something like this in Charlotte NC. Hmmm, business opportunity?"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"There are coffee shops everywhere, but Philz is my most favorite coffee place ever. You choose a coffee blend, a size, how sweet, and how creamy. While you're just choosing a blend, there are so many variations, and so many blends to choose from.  My favorites are:  Philharmonic It's the Best Philtered Soul Sooo Good"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Good service, tasty coffee.. one cup at a time so it might take a few extra minutes.. worth the wait though. Enjoyed on my walk to Kite hill."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Fantastic coffee. Authentic flavors. We are visiting from out of town and happy to have discovered this place
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Love Philz coffee in general. This location tends to be a bit quieter. Lots of Noe Valley Moms with babies in strollers usually. Good service.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,I have been a huge fan of the breakfast burritos here for a while but it seems they keep getting smaller and smaller. They are half the size as they were a year ago and the price keeps going up. Just not worth the value any more :(
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"I love the Philz on 24 th st and I recently tried one of the newer Philz that opened in the Castro. This coffee shop works well in this location. They had outside side walk seating as well as indoor. I actually met people and had a great conversation, which doesn't usually happen. I am unusual in that I like light or medium blend, I had the Manhatten and fell in love with it and the vibe. They had some fantastic cookies too. I was being very bad that day, but it was delicious! Chocolate chip with coconut. I'd post a picture, but I totally ate it all! I would like to see them incorporate more art and authenticity, like 24th st has, but that could come in time. Maybe they could host gallery shows?"
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,The mint mojito is probably my favorite drink in SF; i ask for it hot though. Service is good although it can take awhile for baristas to make your drink. They have random games but most people are working on laptops or mothers coming in with kids.They have dog biscuits which is nice.
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Last Sunday we purchased a pound of coffee at Philz on 24th in the Mission.  Many hours later, upon arriving home, we realized that we didn't have the coffee, and probably left it on the bench outside of the store, where we were drinking the cups of coffee that we also purchased that morning.  I called Philz and the lovely woman Emily who answered the phone said, yes, in fact someone had found pound of coffee and brought it back into the store (!!).  She promptly arranged with the warehouse to ship out a new pound directly to my house.  It arrived a day or so later and we are enjoying it now.  Emily emailed me to let me know it was on its way!  Not only is this great coffee, but the customer service is incredible, and the customers themselves are amazing (I mean, where else would you find people who actually return a $16 pound of coffee that they find on a bench in the Mission!).  Five plus stars for Philz."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"Pretentious baristas with attitude. If any of you baristas are reading this, you do know you're the ones serving right? I didn't apply for a job here, you did. The least you can  do is try to act like customers are not an annoyance.  Coffee: blah. I come here when it's convenient. There are far to many places in the city where they have good coffee."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,Super kid friendly! Has a mat area with books and toys next to entrance. Right across the street from playground. Good drinks and kind staff. Changing table in bathroom. Firemen like to visit this joint!
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,"I love, love, love the Tesora coffee at Philz. So many friends said it was so good, but I didn't believe them and never made the effort to go here.  I was first introduced to this place during an Instagram photowalk. I told the barrista that I was a total newbie. He then asked me what I liked. I said something nutty, where it feels like I'm drinking a bag of peanuts. He carefully brewed with such loving care a 12 ounce cup of Tesora coffee. It's a medium roast, nutty, and having that with real cream was awesome.  Please, if you haven't tried Philz, please do. It's not hype."
Philz Coffee,4298 24th St,The place and clientell seem to be united in there shunning ignoring and disliking homeless people.  They had a stop hate sign in the window I asked dose that include the passive aggressive hate you're place is fat with the next day and still today no more stop hate sign in window please confront them about this
