Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Feels like being in France or Italy. Very tasty (light) food and perfect coffee. Just relax and listen to the music from the 1920th while enjoying your break.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Cute cafe in the neighborhood. Friendly owner and great foods. Lovely experience -- would highly recommend!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,This was the cutest cafe! Breakfast sandwiches & coffee were amazing! But the owner behind the counter making the magic happen- made the experience exceptional! What a gem! Highly recommend!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Everything tasted good but there was one person working at 10am on a Sunday and we waited forever for our food even though it wasn’t busy, need more than 1 person taking ordering a, making coffee and cooking breakfast."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Whole in the wall with a limited menu full of delicious dishes. I'd recommend this place to anyone. I had the Mediterranean Frittata with smoked salmon. It was a great frittata. I also had a $7 mamosa! Very well priced drink. Also, can't rave more about the music that took you out of San Francisco and to France just sitting in a cafe people watching."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"A necessary stop anytime my girlfriend and I are in the area. Two bagels, two coffees and two chocolate donuts. Everything is always delicious and the owner always a delight. Forget the areas more corporate spots, come here instead. Don't forget to tip 💸"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Nice place for breakfast, wouldn’t call it a super high end place. The place was popular amongst locals but they wasn’t all too appealing for first timers. I think is a place you would go to if you lived in the area for some time and just need a regularly priced coffee."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Beautiful restaurant with the best lox bagel I have ever had. The place all in all is exquisite from the service to atmosphere to the food.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Sat outside for breakfast. Got lunch to go for a picnic on the north side of the bridge after our walk across the bridge. Sandwiches were good too.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,The food here is pretty great and their prices are pretty cheap too. I will recommend eating the food here whenever you have a chance.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Loved the ambiance and neighborhood.  People were really nice!  Food was good but not amazing.  Coffee was great.  Crab and sherry soup of the day was excellent.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great little cafe! Had some great sandwiches here. Staff seemed really lovely and very welcoming.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Just the best Francisco Bagels. Friendly service. Can’t recommend highly enough. Great local place to stop.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Really great coffee and sandwiches!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Just cafe, nothing special. You can also get meal at here. Many tables at inside. When I sat, the table was dirty and sticky. I odered single iced coffee and single mocha. The iced cofffee came in large cup. Taste was not good. Just soso. It was too light coffee. Mocha was not bad.  I think if you find the quite cafe around fisherman's wharf, here is good choice."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Cute cafe in the neighborhood. Very warm, friendly folks and amazing coffee. Must visit!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Very bad experience  We’re here with my kids, ordered Cesar with chicken and tuna sandwich.  Hygiene not recommended- salad were old and rotten, didn’t get washed, bread burned, chef did not change gloves between al his doing..  Can not recommend!!  One star - got my money back - no question asked."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Went here for lunch today and loved it! I had the Francisco Bagel and highly recommend
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Excellent coffee, excellent vibes. They also have food!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Fresh and delicious! The owner is so kind and the service is very friendly.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great local place with good food and espresso. I highly recommend stopping here.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,I came here months ago during a trip and still remember it because the guy behind the counter was very kind and offered good suggestions on what to have.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Good breakfast and espresso. Barista who made our drinks wasn't very friendly, but the other girl who took our order was. Overall, good place to come too."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Really nice sandwich and great price. Quite and quick in the afternoon. Lots of options on the menu. Seasoned well.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"My local cafe and I enjoy everything about it. The owner is very nice and makes you feel apart of the community. The coffee and the food is amazing. Also great ambiance, never that crowded and can be a great place to chill or get work done. 10/10"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great quite and chill place to have a beer and relax! The waiter is really polite and helpful! The Italian classic music in the back adds a note of love and peace to the place! I’ll definitely come back!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"The owner is the barista. He works Wednesday through Sunday and is closed Monday and Tuesday. He's very friendly and lots of locals frequent this location because of the atmosphere. The coffee is amazing.  Because he works by himself, if there is a lot of people, it can take a little bit of time to get your order. But he is so kind and everyone is so friendly that no one seems bothered by a few extra minutes. People keep coming back and so do I  :)"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Rude and borderline dangerous owner. I put the umbrella up on one of their outdoor seats but it broke because of the wind and almost fell on my head. The owner came out and started yelling at me because he blamed me for breaking it. I told him that he needed to calm down but he started cussing at me and got in my face like he was about to punch me. The other guests were shocked also. I think his English wasn't good so he might have gotten confused at the situation but it doesn't excuse his dangerous and unprofessional behavior. Avoid this coffee shop, there are plenty of other good places in San Francisco"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,So so. I don’t think the clerks clear the tables frequently since the tables are sticky with sugar and somethings.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Nice place for a quick stop in for a cup of your favorite espresso, or a bagel on the go. The food was good, but very basic. I ordered the Frittata, which i assume was made right on the spot. As it consisted of crackes whole eggs, not scrambled with onion tossed in. A little on the bland side, but the salmon on top helped. My friend ordered the bagel with lox, but forgot his lox. The food was not terrible, but simple. I take it easy on the guy as he was the only one working. The coffee was good, but like I said, expect simple and quick."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Friendly and unpretentious local cafe. I had a latte here, which turned out to be pretty decent."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Small but personal touch taste. Mediterranean plate is superb. Overall Nice and Clean
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Stumbled upon this lovely corner cafe while I was trekking somewhat frenetically around San Fran in attempt to see the city while here on business. I had the Greek Salad and a glass Italian wine... and they kindly showed me where I could charge my thoroughly dead phone. Gracious, warm service. Food was great! Atmosphere authentic and delightful!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,I didn’t like the breakfast bagel .. Didn't like the whole experience ..  Not recommended at all ..
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"I had the delicious Francisco bagel to go with capers, tomato, red onion and a generous amount of delicious cream cheese all on a toasted, crunchy, chewy, perfectly done seeded bagel. Hold the lox. Looking forward to having a leisurely brunch here once I feel safe enough to do so, as it looks like a nice place to people watch (and there's some really cool art on the walls!). Great service, friendly people, fresh and flavorful food."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"A group of friends went yesterday. I arrived with another friend a bit later and ask for permission to go to the restroom and it was denied since it was clean. No apologies, as if going to the toilet was a choice instead a basic need. Very disappointed."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,We came here for coffee last week because we decided to spend some time here. We love to have a chit-chat over a cup of coffee. We picked this location because it's one of the best places to grab a java. I just think the chocolate overwhelms the coffee that you may think you're drinking hot chocolate. It's worth trying!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Loved the ambiance and neighborhood.  People were really nice!  Food was good but not amazing.  Coffee was great.  Crab and sherry soup of the day was excellent.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Nice coffee shop with nice staff. My friend eats there daily and the salads look amazing. Lots of outdoor seating and indoor seating. A relaxed gem in in the neighborhood. Enjoy some good food and coffee drinks. Also you will meet a mix of locals and tourist. Its great. You will not regret it!!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"The food was freshly prepared so you wait just a bit, but it's well worth it. Place had a nice neighbourhood ""buzz"" and feel about it. It is handy for the Mason-Powell turnaround stop and, as well as breakfast, does lunch and dinner with a happy hour from 2.00pm - 6.00pm. Staff were ultra-friendly and helpful."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Mediocre food that's vastly overpriced. And onion bagels with jam and butter are just wrong, especially for breakfast. All disposable plates etc also bad. Shop itself is pretty."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Friendly local spot with outdoor seating. Would be nice to see more plant-based options on the menu. I can't give 5 stars to anywhere offering single-use plastics and non recyclable coffee cups though.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Cute spot. Awesome staff. Had a falafel sandwich that hit the spot. Bright and airy.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Glad others had a good experience here, but we did not. Chicken on my salad was about an hour past its prime. Server was clueless about any kind of welcoming attitude. My dad witnessed someone behind the counter dropping food on the floor and then putting it back on the counter rather than in the trash. Good general atmosphere, and I'd go here for a coffee, but I would not eat food they prepared again. 1.5 stars."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,My son and I love getting sandwiches here when we come into the city. An unassuming and charming little lunch spot with a delightful staff that has always been super friendly to my 6yo. The food is very good and the prices aren't astronomical. And it's only 3 blocks away from the more touristy Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"I come here for lunch once a week, always super friendly, I always get the Francisco Bagel with Lox and The San Fran sandwich. Really nice spot to sit outside in the sun and eat."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Their coffee and sandwich were great but the back area was dirty and the toilet itself was in a bad state. Friendly people though.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,I always LOVE going to this caffe. I got to know it well when I lived around the corner from it. For 10+ years. The espresso and the food are great. Ambience is wonderful. And near many key locations I need. I don't drive these days due to past major illnesses. And happily walk around for many errands as well as great sights.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"I really can't rate this place low enough. Felt unwelcome right from the start when the waitress looked as though she would really rather not have to bother. The whole experience though was truly tarnished by losing my wallet, 10 minutes after leaving I realised and called the cafe only to be left holding and then have the phone put down on me. When I returned they couldn't have done any less to help. Shocking customer service but what grates even more is to see such a lack of support for someone (a customer!) who has a problem. Don't go there!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Live in the neighborhood and have been coming for the last 10 years. Most of the time just to grab a sandwich or coffee and go. Staff is super friendly, love the lox bagel. I think they could do a bit more with the place since it has high ceilings, outdoor seating and some cool booths inside."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Good food and nice little spot but the lady who served us didn't give us a great service. We ordered and paid and then the  waitress told us we have 30minutes to eat and drink as they closing the store...also our table was dirty and stocky and we had to beg to get it cleaned! Shame as the food manu is delicious and the food actually tasted amazing!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"The food at Cafe Francisco is good, though not great.  The service is good, though not great.  The atmosphere/environment is good, though not great.  I think you get the point.  Cafe Francisco is a small venue with some character.  I'd suggest to grab a booth for you and your date, or just sit at a table outside if you can."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"I wasn't sure what to order and asked advices to the waitress. She said in spanish ""Que pesada"" which means ""so annoying"" to her co-worker, thinking I wouldn't understand. I decided to not tip at the counter, she showed immediately the receipt to the chef. The salad was awful, didn't cut any of the bacon, cheese or veggies because I didn't tip. Never seen such little respect. I do not recommend this place."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"This is the best cafe food and drink i’ve had in san francisco. Lived here about a year. Owner is beyond friendly. Great place to grab food, read, meet with friends, etc."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Amazing coffee and food. The service was top notch and the location is prime for getting work done or just enjoying the bustle of the city. Would recommend
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"So i was eating my bagel when this man (who seemed to be autistic, but that's besides the point) walked in asking for free water. The man behind the counter was kind enough to give him water and a piece of bread! Based off this one instance, I can conclude the service is top-notch!!!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Nice local place. Great coffee and small Italian bistro with great atmosphere and people. I guess dog friendly even though I think that's a little nasty....but whatever floats your boat.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"The staff were rude. Firstly I asked if I could go sit outside but wasn't advised I'd have to come back in to get my order. Secondly I ordered a cafe latte, was given a chai latte and when I asked for it to be re-made the server refused to accept she had heard wrong, although did make a new drink (which was then so hot I burnt my tongue)"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"The food is good but very expensive. Everything you eat from is disposable, but the staff is very nice"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Excellent caprese salad (with basil leaves and capers) and decent turkey sandwiches. Good spot for young kids. Only minor issue is that the bottled beer isn't ice cold.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"The service seems to really hate their jobs here. The carafe of coffee was barely warm. When asking what the sample was they had out, the lady responded ""bread"". It was a lemon poundcake. Overall, it was meh. Didn't bother getting food. Not gonna come back."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great restaurant with amazing food!! I always visit when I come from out of state!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Really liked this place. We grabbed a bagel and latte. Nice to sit outside in a good neighbourhood or inside as well. Toilet is a bit weird located next to the kitchen.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"My autistic son, P A U L, walked in with a condom on his head and a bomb in his lunchbox.  The manager still served him free water and a free piece of bread.  Outstanding service. 5/5"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,My friend was a little parched and went in for a small cup of water. The very polite and kind owner decided to not only give him a cup of water and straw but also a small slice of bread. Great Service Cx
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"I stood there for 20 minutes without being acknowledged while the lone employee got people's sandwich orders wrong. Couldn't get a cup of coffee in that time, having been front of the line since arriving.  This fella must not be serious."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Nice little cafe with good coffee and friendly service. A good place to work, you can ask for the WiFi password. Not to crowded, light music. You can also sit outside."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great small cafe. Reasonable prices and welcoming owner.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Had coffee and Mediterranean Frittata here. Coffee taste like hot milk, couldn't drink more than 2 sips of it. Breakfast was alright for the price"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,It's good.  Really small place but the food and coffee is good.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Guess what New York City, you’re not the only one with good pastrami. This place is amazing good pastrami"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Had brunch for four and it was very good. Indoor and outside seating but a bit tight. Food was hot and tasty and prices were reasonable. Great corner location.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Owner was very nice and kind to me and my autistic brother Cx. Not only did he give us water but also delicious italian bread. Thank you kind sir.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Always friendly service, good food & espresso, and wonderful atmosphere inside and out"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"I work near Pier 39 and face severely limited lunch options. A coworker introduced me to this spot and it's great for a quick lunch if you're in the neighborhood. There are lots of reasonably priced options from sandwiches to salads to mediterranean food. The Greek plate I had was awesome - plenty of pita for my hummus (always something restaurants never seem to give you enough of), falafel, great greek salad, and dolmas. All of that for less than $8, thumbs up to Cafe Francisco!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great North Beach secret just steps off the tourist beaten Wharf path.  Vintage setting with consistent cool beats piped outside as well.  Several mouth watering frittatas to choose from at a reasonable price in the morning.  Sip wine during happy hour every day from 4pm-7pm.  The art curator always has original work on display from local photographers and painters.  Very family-feel here - I always feel welcome -- fast wi-fi and a nice second office.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Hell ya. Great bagel. Great morning solitude.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Came in to the store and the guy behind the counter was AWESOME! Really polite and courteous encounter and would love to come again. I would recommend Cafe Francisco to all of my friends!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,I was sitting and enjoying my delicious coffee and bread when (what seemed like) an autistic man and his vato came in. They were homeless people asking for a drink and bread. The generous owner gave him a cup of water and slice of bread. P A U L  D E N I N O  cx
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,This is the worst place ever! They let you wait half an hour in the line and another half hour or more for the food. Very grumpy man as well. Should hire some more staff to get things going.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Great local shop, owner was in house and very much enjoyed chatting with him. Good sandwiches and happy hour wine vibes 🥂 …"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Great place. A homeless man walked in and asked for water and they gave him water AND FREE BREAD. So nice
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Unfriendly and incompetent service. Ordered a simple item to go - requested NOT to add bacon. Came home, opened the box - it's full of bacon."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Amazing place, class act! A homeless man walked into the cafe and asked for a glass of water and some bread, they provided the bread and water to him without asking a single question."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Got to love Cafe Francisco, outdoor seating,fresh fresh fresh.... quality breakfast great variety of salads sandwiches  and happy hour in the sun, great music and selection of beer and wine, yes that's what's mama recommended."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Lovely lady serving and a nice traditional setting but the coffee was really disappointing. Very weak and the latte didn’t differ from the flat white in any way
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Amazing place amazing staff one man in particular gave my friend a piece of bread and a cup of water to help him . He sees a homeless person and instead of judging he helps them amazing place i recommend it .
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,I love this place and visit as often as i can. It is cool vintage cafe with local artists and nice people. Food is delicious and not expensive.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Owner was very nice to my friend with disabilities. Hooked him up with a free slice of bread and cup of cold water. 5/5
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"great place , good vibes, perfect cute local touch from san Francisco, great fresh food and the owner and Jasmin are very very friendly and nice people . definitely coming back."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Very bad experience. تجربة سيئة جدا. The workers are arrogant and the service is very ugly.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Great food, but also just a lovely place to sit down and get away from it all. You could close your eyes and imagine you're on vacation."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"This little place we stumbled upon on our morning walk and ended up with an AMAZING breakfast!! There was no wait, pleasant service and excellent food!"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Defenitely has the best bread in Town. Me and my friend Cx love it! Owner is always happy and really loves the people in San Francisco.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,VERY great place. The guy was such a nice person and even gave complimentary bread which was top notch Cx
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Rating low because i didn't enjoy my coffee. Either it's normal there or happened to us, it tasted just milk considering I only like strong coffee."
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Overall great food. The only bummer is sometimes the staff are a little unfriendly. Its in a great location and food is easy to get togo.
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Terrible service, didn’t show any respect to us. The salad was terrible, no seasoning, tons of spinach and 4 Pieces of bacon on top. Waste of money... Do not go there"
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,Nice ambiance and neighborhood! Really enjoyed the coffee offerings and appetizers (at happy hour price)!
Cafe Francisco,2161 Powell St,"Outstanding establishment for breakfast. Friendly employees, very cool decor and delicious breakfast and specialty coffee. Loved this place!"
