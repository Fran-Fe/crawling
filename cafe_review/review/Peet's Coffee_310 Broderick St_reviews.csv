Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Standard Peet's Coffee location.  This coffee shop is located near the DMV and has plenty of parking nearby. There's also a grocery store with a door that leads into here. There is no indoor seating, but there are a few tables and benches outdoors. I don't think there's a restroom, but I could be wrong. When ordering an iced drink, remember to ask for light ice if you want more to drink. The prices have increased, but they're average for the city."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,Clean and Nice terrace outside. Good for waiting driving test of your wife
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Delicious coffee. The service is fast and friendly, and the cappuccino's are quite tasty. They now have oat milk for those of us who can't do dairy. The store is very clean. Check it out."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"This foto I making 12 years ago. I was walking down the street and decided to buy a cup of coffee. this coffee from a street vendor turned out to be tastier than all the coffee I've had in my entire life. since then, I always compare all the coffee I drink with this coffee from San Francisco. still haven't come across a better one. Hello everyone from Thailand!"
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Ordered a medium matcha as I have been since the pandemic. No ice but foam. The drink was served half full. When I asked the cashier if perhaps the foam went down, he said No, my manager says that drinks with no ice only get a certain amount of ounces. This medium matcha is almost 6 dollars. No flexibility in adding to the drink. I've been coming to this location since it opened. Really disappointing. Have mad love for my service workers but consistency and fairness to all customers (ESP. given the times) would be appreciated. Holding off and going local from now on."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"This is my favorite location. I've been coming here since moving back in August of 2019 . Although since the last time I did a review for this place a lot of the staff I considered friends have gone, the new staff is great, friendly, & very welcoming. You can tell they love they're job here. Best lattes in town so far. Get a vanilla latte made with Half & Half. It's delicious."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,Google maps says that you open at 6.  I went  out of my way to get there at 6:30 and they were closed.  Please change your hours.
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,I go there often I like their coffee there is no substitute
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Located in Haight - Ashbury area, stopped here to grab my morning Cafe latte. They have seating outside in a shaded area. It is located in the backside of a convenient store. Pretty good service, even though it was busy when I visited. Good place sit and relax and enjoy your coffee!"
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"My morning favorite Peet's coffee stop Best of all is the crew is very wonderful in serving the customers very appreciated every time to also say ""Hi"" !!!  Thank you Tom!!!  Yes parking available and fast pick up when you order  on the app😎👍 Highly recommend it!!!"
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"This Peet's is located in Falleti Foods grocery store. This location is convenient and has a nice outdoor patio seating area. Today i tried the new Plantbase Mediterranean Flatbread and i was pleasantly surprised by the delicious, Kale, Provolone Cheese, Sun-dried Tomatoes, Bell peppers and toasty Lavash Flatbread."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Make my own coffee at home. So cost effective. However, Peet's does very well."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Peets has the best coffee but overall has turned into a corporate chain that is a far cry from the original.  It's now a generic coffee shop.  Their coffee has the best taste, they pull their own shots of espresso  (not a machine where you just punch buttons) and they steam great foam."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"Me and family came  here before our dinner at nopalito for a coffee on Father’s Day. Ordered 2 lattes for me and my husband, about 30 min later we both started feeling odd. Our coffee was spiked and we were drugged!!!!! BEWARE OF THIS Place! We will be reporting this place and will be  under investigation. Our symptoms were both the same and after the coffee!"
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"I’ve been going to this coffe shop since I moved to NOPA about a month ago. As many of you know, your coffe shop experience is often the first public interaction outside your home; therefore, it’s a unpleasant way to start your day when greeted with a snarky or disgruntled barista. The service is not always poor but often there’s a palpable air of discontent, especially when asking to make a last minute alteration to my order. I’ve worked in customer service for 20 years, including 8 years of front and back of house restaurant experience. Ultimately even a high maintenance customer should be treated with a consistent positive attitude. If you can’t fake it, then maybe find a different job. This is my first ever written review.  Thank you and I hope it’s taken as constructive criticism."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"I asked for light ice so I can get more tea... but they only filled my drink 3/4 of the way up. Peets why you gotta do me like that :,("
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,Love Peets Coffee......from Lattes to Mochas......have spent so much money there........thx for the fun memories.......Happy 2023.....
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"This particular Peets' idea of a flat white (medium sized with two shots) is very off. I was served what was essentially a latte with no foam. A 16 ounce cup with two shots of espresso and just a ton of steamed milk. About 10 ounces more of a drink(mostly milk) that I hoped to get.  I'm more than happy to have just an espresso instead and I more than understand if the barista cannot make a particular drink, as long as I'm informed and not served something that's wayyyy off. Haha."
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,I visit about 2-3 times a week. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Reminds me of the shop I worked in downtown years ago. They know most folks names and have their drinks ready before they get to the counter.
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"My number one store when it comes to Peet’s Coffee! They always maintain this store clean, friendly staff, & quick service even on a busy morning!

Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,Good service and love the quality of peets coffee and freddos. My personal favorite is the matcha green tea freddo. Fast service and sitting spots out away from the sun in back from the grocery store madness. A quick walk up to the haight and all is good from here.
Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,The youngsters one aren’t good I ordered a a vanilla latte this morning and she gave me a watery and cold latte this is probably the worst peets coffee in sf

Peet's Coffee,310 Broderick St,"THE BEST STAFF EVER....I love how you can get the same amount of coffee in  a bigger cup to add cream or milk. One of the key reasons I go to Peets.  Peets Terminology (It works at this location at least)  1) ""Marge"" - Medium cup of coffee in a large cup 2) ""Smedium"" ( pronounced semedium)  Small cup of coffee in a medium cup"
