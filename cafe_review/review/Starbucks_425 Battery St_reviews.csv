Starbucks,425 Battery St,Slowest Starbucks in history and not because they’re busy.  Customer service is friendly but it’s the only Starbucks I ever wait at and am the 2nd to only one in there.  Go two blocks away to the corner of Cal & Battery if you don’t want to be late to work or spend your entire break waiting for coffee.  Clean though.
Starbucks,425 Battery St,"Starbucks is so famous everywhere and I just love to sit and sip coffee and take a bite of their regular pastry. I love the mug which comes with your name engraved but the coca nitrogen is not something different- its same like plain cold coffee, water and ice. Nothing awesome about it."
Starbucks,425 Battery St,"Very clean and comfortable, the place to go to get coffee food and more"
Starbucks,425 Battery St,Kerry is awesome! He made my day!!! 🍵 …
Starbucks,425 Battery St,"Poor customer service, very disorganized teenage staff. I like Starbucks, they're generally well run with eager to please staff. This one is unpleasant, the staff seems more focused on gossip than saying ""hello."" A lot of attitude"

Starbucks,425 Battery St,Good coffee! But expensive…
Starbucks,425 Battery St,"Oscar a barista at this shop decided a 62 year old writer was not welcome at his shop. I was a fraud, e would bang on the restroom door every time I used it. Used a bogus patron of the week contest to try to provoke me and laughing at me it was so funny. Oscar used friends to start a confrontation. Slanderous lies meant to damage. Sadly this lack of common good behavior is very  normal at all San Francisco coffee shops and Starbucks is no different. Adolescent  behavior or worse. This nation of cowards are about to get what they deserve."
