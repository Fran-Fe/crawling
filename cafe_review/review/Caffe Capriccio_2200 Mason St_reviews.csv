Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Ordered an iced matcha latte and a chicken club with pesto and it was so delicious!! The latte was a perfect flavor, earthy but still creamy and mild, with honey sweetener! The sandwich was so tasty, smokey from the bacon, substantial with chicken and cheese, and flavorful with the pesto condiments and fresh tomato and arugula!! The service was wonderful, so nice and fast, the cafe was clean and tranquil in a nice environment :) I strongly recommend!!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Great experience at this lovely cafe! Owner is very attentive and is proud of the quality of food being served. We had a breakfast bagel with egg, cheese and bacon as well as a funky avocado toast with a boiled egg on top. Coffee was delicious and the space is very relaxed. Happy we got to try this place on our trip!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Delicious food and coffee, healthy options as well as tasty treats offered and all delicious. Everything is obviously made with skill and quality ingredients. The menu has so many great options, too.  The atmosphere is great too, the interior is clean and beautiful. Everything is small and quaint but neat and well put together. There are even plants on the window sill you can purchase from another local shop. There's calm Italian music playing. It's got such a great vibe for a slow, relaxing, beautiful place to enjoy your food and drinks.  The service was also fantastic! One of the two days I visited, they had a massive rush mid morning and they rocked it. A worker even went around after the rush died down and made sure everyone was happy and got the right thing. Definitely they give more service than a typical cafe."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"I walked by and stopped for a quick Espresso. Nice little cafe with outdoor and indoor seating. Inside it feels like little Italy. A fancy Espresso Machine, small delicious pastry and a nice selection of breakfast, sandwiches, salads and more. What stood out to me was the friendliness from the very beginning. Absolut amazing. You feel so comfortable here. Almost like home or on vacation in Italy. Very kind. Not to forget, Espresso was excellent and the pastry super delicious. Try the trio (mini bomboloni) - it won’t disappoint you. I just added this place to my favorite coffee and breakfast places in San Francisco. I will definitely come back. Thank you"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Excellent and warm masters of hospitality, americanos, lattes, lox bagels, and so much more!  I wish I had enough time to try everything on the menu, unfortunately I am a tourist at the moment.  The space is so inviting and CC is so beyond what I envisioned what a great a cafe in San Francisco would be."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"A gem on the corner of Mason St. And Chestnut. After walking around seeing the sites and sounds, we stop here for a late lunch. Everyone there was so nice! Service was excellent and the Caffé is charming. They ran out of falafel but more than willing to substitute with chicken or another alternative. All the sandwiches were made with care and had fresh ingredients. If you are touring and want a nice place to stop and just breathe... This is a great spot."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Stopped in for a coffee and breakfast. The food was fantastic and so was the coffee. Seems to be family owned and operated and the people were very friendly and accommodating. Next time I’m in the area I will be stopping again. Thank you for a great Friday morning breakfast.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Wonderful experience! This is a cute, family-owned cafe run by husband and wife. They both are so friendly and welcoming! I visited a few times during my trip to San Francisco and they remembered who I was during my repeat visits. They really show appreciation for all their customers. I love their golden turmeric latte. During my last visit, I also got a chicken pesto sandwich, which was delicious. I would definitely go back if I'm back in San Francisco!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"I absolutely love this place! The staff is friendly, the coffee is some of the best I’ve ever had. Great attention to detail. Cozy inside for work and sunny quite outside."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"First time ever visiting SF and was walking down to pier 33 with my husband and son and stumbled across this place and we loved it ! We got Turkey BLT’s and they were very good, they were loaded sandwiches , they were cut in half and we were ok with eating a half and saving the other for later . The man that attended us was super friendly and our sandwiches were made to order in a timely matter, I absolutely loved them, so filling and good, if I’m ever around SF again I definitely will go back😃😃"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Really nice and cozy cafe! It'sa hidden gem!! Amazing coffee, amazing food, amazing service! Would definitely come again!!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Been working from here this morning, Great atmosphere, Cozy and really nice people! Coffee and bagels are woww!!! Thanks guys 🙏🏼"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,This was our  go-to place for breakfast during our 4 day stay in SF. Good food and hands-down  the best customer service at a restaurant I’ve ever had. The owner is personable. Greets you with a smile every day and makes sure that each and every customer is well taken care of.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"A lovely little cafe. I visited San Francisco for a week and had the pleasure to get breakfast from Caffe Capriccio multiple times. One time, I couldn't make it and the staff actually remembered us and asked my friends where I had gone. They even gave us homemade pastries on the house.  As a vegan, they did not have the most options, but I made small adjustments to some items and they still tasted delicious. Highly recommend."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Beautiful little place 5 minutes of lite walk from Fisherman's where you can also see the Coit Tower. Peaceful morning with some lite music in the background tucked away from all the noise and tourists but yet so close. Super clean. Love it!
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,I ordered the veggie bagel! Not bad! Many dishes inside. The service was good! The one who I believe he’s the owner was kind and passionate to customers. And he recommended me the hummus dip to try.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"The owner allowed me to taste the coffees to find one I liked. Had a double shot coffee which was fantastic. Full of flavour and nice and strong. Far better than others we have had. To go with it, we had a double baked croissant which was nice, crunchy and delicious. Although small and out of the way, I would recommend this little caffe."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Epitome of a cozy Cafe. And I do love a cozy Cafe. Perfect coffee, good prices, fresh orange juice. 🍊 ☕️ 🥯"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Unfortunatly I haven’t done the good choice for my breakfast. My sandwich was classic and not generous. 3 avocado slim slice. Nice welcome.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Lovely! 💜 Molto buonissimo! Stayed at the Hotel across the street and just dropped in for an espress and to get some work done. What a pleasant surprise! Clean, comfortable, fast WiFi and excellent espresso! We speak Italian and found that the owner did, too. We felt right at home. 😊 Food was great, too. (Torta alla Nonna!) If you need a quiet caffè to get some work done or meet up with friends or coworkers, I highly recommend this Caffè!!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Good coffee, good sandwiches, excellent service - very hospitable and personable! We loved coming here everyday while in SF"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Bit on the pricey side, food took a while, and my sandwich was oh so slightly burnt on the outside. Not the best café as there are better options around the area. 7/10"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,I ate there on 25 September 22 and enjoyed the bagel with egg and sausage. The chili paste served with it was super tasty too. The coffee was high standard (like good Australian coffee) and the service was friendly. I ate outside and bathed in the sun. It was a great last breakfast for my recent trip to North America. I wish them the best
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Great breakfast ever great service
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,quiet little cafe for lunch. best panini sandwich i’ve had in sf — chicken bacon arugula tomato with spicy pesto
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,The best coffee in this area. Quiet and lovely place to relax.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"What an amazing little spot! Stopped for a quick drink after a morning of waking, staff were really nice and friendly. 100% recommend it if your in the area!!!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Today , i tried caffe capriccio for the first time and it was a great expression, food was great , service is even better . If you are around north beach and looking for a spot to eat , caffe capriccio would be the best."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Great spot! Super friendly staff, were very flexible with my kids requests. Very good selection of sandwiches and salads. Perfect spot for a snack or light meal."

Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Great place!! Super nice owner, delicious coffee and food, relaxing ambiance. I love coming here"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"I LOVE this place! I live nearby and it's my neighborhood breakfast / lunch / coffee spot. Every time I'm there and see tourists who have stumbled upon it, it makes me happy they've found this local gem that is sure to make them fall in love with San Francisco and North Beach.  Their egg wrap is my favorite! It's prepared to order with a real egg and the lightly dressed greens they put in it are amazing. It's delicious and such a nice alternative to a greasy egg wrap or burrito and I always feel great after eating it. Their coffee is really good too! They're just a block or two up from Starbucks and their coffee is SO MUCH BETTER.  Their service is also great. They are super friendly and they've taken great COVID precautions. It's also really nice that you can see them making the food so you know that it's clean and safely prepared. I can't recommend this place enough!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"This is a cute little place on the corner not too far off the beaten path if you're taking in San Francisco. It wasn't super busy and the wait was a bit long, but if you're not in a rush, swing in and enjoy."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Loved the service and atmosphere.  Really enjoyed the coyote meandering down the middle of the street. Haha
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Good coffee, excellent sandwiches, and great service."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,One of the many many great cafes in the north beach. What Capriccio has going for it is that it is actually pretty far away from most of the other cafes in little italy in north beach. You feel like you are getting far from the maddening crowd when you check out this little place on Mason street.  The drinks were excellent and I was always impressed by the food. The wraps were large and always tasty and came with a salad for a nice filling lunch. The drinks can be a pit pricey but its worth dropping 15 bucks to go to a quiet area and work and not be bothered by a ton of people coming in and out like you see and many cafes in north beach.  I especially liked the work area in Capriccio. The wifi was strong and the seating was comfortable. They have a large couch area in the back with pillows and plenty of outside seating to enjoy the rare sight of sun in the area.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,The Best top Owner knows what's up ..
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Tucked away on a quiet corner in North beach is this little gem. Great coffee, but great art plasters the walls. Old iconic photos of San Francisco history.  I am not sure if any of the art is for sale, but its worth inquiring"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Great neighborhood spot, top tier service."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,My wife and I spend wonderful 45 Minutes here :) the cappuccino was awesome and the store owner is super friendly.  If I could give 10 stars I would .
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Delicious food, lovely atmosphere. We were a little lost on our walk but glad we found this place. 😊"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,One of the best coffee I have tasted in US (from a European´s standpoint). The place could need a upgrade and some painting but the service was good and the coffee was excellent. They also have free WiFi and mobile phone chargers available for no cost.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Very cool little coffee shop away from all the tourist attractions. Felt very homely. Coffee was pretty good. I had a Nutella Latte which was good, but could've had some more flavor. Still beats Starbucks."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"This awesome little place was close to our hotel when we were in San Francisco recently. As we walked by, I thought it looked pretty cool so we decided to grab a quick mocha. Wow.  The Mocha was SO goood. Seriously, the best. I went back the next morning to have another, try their quiche and get some work done. Nice people, great little place, for sure."
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,I was happy that they could do up a soy decaf latte for me. Had a nice little bit of lemon cake too. It was an enjoyable and chill place for a coffee with friends. Liked that it was unpretentious and relaxed unlike other fancy cafes.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Great service and tasty food.
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,Good selection of bagels and sandwiches. Very good cappuccino
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"I haven't tried the food as there aren't any vegan options that I would choose but the coffee is good, service is friendly, and it's a great spot to sit outside and people-watch. Would be great to see a few vegan additions to the menu"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Cute little cafe with amazing coffee and lattes (got the Americano and Iced Chai Latte) and sandwiches. I particularly enjoyed the California Turkey Pannini, Caprese Pannini and the Smoked Salmon Bagel. Exceptional service, super friendly staff! Great to hang out in, read a book or study/work with a laptop. Will definitely come again if I visit San Fran in the future!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,"Really cute cafe with great customer service! I was near Pier 39 and looking for a cafe I could do some work in. After a quick ""best coffices"" search on Google I found this GEM. I bought an iced coffee and a super yummy ""Mexicali"" quiche. I'm normally not that big of a fan of quiches but this one has a nice blend of cheesy, spicy goodness! The barista/cashier was really sweet and was helpful, giving me recommendations, as I had never been there before. Some tourists around but not overrun like the Starbucks a couple blocks up. Will definitely return to this cafe!"
Caffe Capriccio,2200 Mason St,False advertisement! no latte art! Extremely hot mediocre coffee with with an attempt of a heart shape... the prosciutto di Parma panini was more of a cheap ham from supermarket 🤬 the lady was super nice and she was by her self doing everything poor lady was overworked! …
