Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,LINE hotel & Alfred Tea are finally in SF🙏🏻 Iced Vanilla Latte was so delicious. Their coffee menu is a bit pricy but worth to try. Also I loved hotel lobby. Very clean & contemporary vibe!
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"Pretty cool to have an Alfred’s coffee in SF, I usually go to one whenever I’m in LA. This one doesn’t seem to have the same charm as the ones in SoCal, but I’m happy to have a location here.  The iced lattes and cold brews are very good, I always ask to go light on the sweetness though. It Does seem to be a little more expensive than other coffee shops that I go to in SF, but still like to stop here once in a while! I feel like most people in SF aren’t aware that we have this option now. ☕️"
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"This coffee was magical and so yummy. I have never heard of it before but when I went the atmosphere was so cozy, comforting and alive. The drinks were amazing and so was the choco chip cookie. Would definitely go again"
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"Newly opened outpost of LA-native Alfred Coffee serving up pretty good drinks in a clean environment with friendly service.  The shop is set back from Market Street and away from Union Square, making for a relaxing albeit a little slow atmosphere.  Seating is somewhat limited, but aside from the early close hours it’d be a nice spot to camp out with a laptop. No outlets though.  The general area has suffered after covid, but hopefully foot traffic picks up soon."
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,I was so excited to try their iced vanilla latte. I couldn’t really enjoy the drink though because the syrup sank to the bottom. I tried stirring/shaking it but I ended up making a big mess.  I overheard another customer ask the batista if she could add more syrup because he ended up drinking the syrup in his first few sips. Perhaps they should add the syrup last or stir everything together before adding the ice.  Other than that it was pretty good and the workers were really nice.
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,Good coffees and quick pre-made bites. The shop is nestled in the corner of the building on Turk Street and offers a modern relaxing atmosphere. Excellent service.
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"Love their tagline. The place is clean, bright and perfect for studying. The barista was also super nice. Will definitely be back."
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,Prepare to pay a pretty penny here! Had a regular iced vanilla coffee for $7.50 which was quite steep and not what I was initially prepared to pay. Vanilla syrup and ice adds $$. Great service and setting however!
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"We ordered some breakfast sandwiches, and I'm 99% sure they dumped a salt shaker into the eggs. Otherwise the service was very nice."
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"They only had drip coffee when I went, it’s good basic coffee but $4 for the smallest cup is outrageous. Staff was kind, I’ll be visiting less expensive places for coffee though."
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,"great coffee, great staff, excellent service"
Alfred at the LINE SF,33 Turk St,Great place to meet with some friends
