Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Robin’s Cafe is an incredible neighborhood cafe! The service and menu is a 10/10 and they never disappoint. They are a staple in the Mission district, they support the community and go above and beyond whenever possible. Thank you Robin’s for all you do and all of your delicious foods and beverages, the quality never disappoints."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"The coffee, pastries, sandwiches, avocado toast, and house squeezed juices are all excellent. Definitely try the chocolate chip cookie! They also make a great chai, and they're one of only a few cafes around that has a pleasant space to get a little work done. Love this spot."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Absolute horrible costumer service. Asked when the coffee was brewed, cashier mentioned it was an 1hr ago. I asked if they would brew another, cashier said no. I was shocked because the coffee had been sitting there for an hr. I asked if they care, cashier sarcastically said yes. To be completely honest it was more a reflection of the cashier’s poor costumer service. However Skip on the coffee if you prefer fresh. Food is ok, views are good."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Really great breakfast sliders! The presentation was great, and very flavorful! I had the green and the california sliders and while I preferred the california ones, both are totally worth having again. The atmosphere is good, with lots of light and coffee shop music. Overall a really nice little neighborhood cafe."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,This place is soooooo bomb. I’ve had almost all the sandwiches and they’re all amazing. Particularly love the Cuban and the breakfast sliders. They make everything from scratch including the slider buns and you can taste it!!!!!  The staff are also all super nice and friendly.  Forgot to mention the chocolate chip cookies are gas. It’s hard to go wrong here!
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Had a great meal  here on 7.22.2022 Saturday. The chicken salad sandwich and California sliders were really well made.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Casual coffee spot that serves food as well as a variety of coffee drinks.  Plenty of seating and WiFi available at this welcoming spot. Friendly staff and a nice place to relax with a cup of coffee.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Very charming coffee shop in the Mission. From keto friendly eats to excellent coffee choices, Robin's Cafe is an excellent choice! The owners and staff are super friendly as well!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Delicious :) I really enjoyed my California sliders for breakfast; balanced flavors, fresh ingredients, yummm!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Robins cafe is always a pleasure to walk into. Very friendly and I have always been greeted with kindness. Their coffee is soooooo good!! Their fresh made juices are delicious!!! I feel my body already feeling better. This place is great and I hope they get more support from the neighborhood❤️❤️they are across from a beautiful park and a garden that’s easy to walk around. Covid cautious. Outdoor seating and a delicious amount of food ❤️❤️❤️
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Recently got a deli sandwhich moved the salad around and sandwhich, took some bites , while i close my plate to come back to it . I see a worm crawl out of my plate through the top . I am very disgusted and disappointed"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Enrique was so helpful. The sandwich, pressed juice was amazing. This is one of those hidden gems not many folks know about in the city. Bathrooms are super nice and busy park across the street."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"My favorite avocado toast in the city and possibly ever! I used to live nearby and Robin's Café is still on my list of places to hit up when I'm in the neighborhood (like today for my dentist appointment). The toast is buttery, a perfect soft/crunchy texture, plenty of 🥑, and a perfect medium boiled egg, finished with flaky salt. The espresso drinks and other food is good too! It's on a side street so the outside tables are calm and often shady."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Normally I love it there. But today the Bacon slider that I have very often was made different and not sure why. There was so much black pepper on it that the eggs were covered black when I opened it to see why. Incredibly disappointed.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Great spot. Awesome food and fresh squeezed juices. Great service.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"The food here is exceptional - everything is made fresh in house and it tastes that way. Come early in the mornings and you’ll smell fresh banana bread and morning buns being whipped up. I always get a cortado - one of the few places in the area that doesn’t burn their espresso, so any of their espresso drinks are delightful. The ownership and staff are friendly and remember your name, always smiling. Great marks across the board."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,This is my happy place when I’m at work. I feel really welcomed and they remember me! It’s always such a pleasure to chat with them as well.  I love the whole staff and their menu is scrumptious and consistent.  Go visit them right now — during business hours — and try their vanilla oat latte and their oyster (mushroom) sandwich.  Vegan-friendly!
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,I will miss Robin's dearly. They ended up knowing me by name because how often I ordered an avocado toast and chai latte. I recommend smashing the avocado and hard boiled egg together. Oyster mushroom sandwich is unreal 😋 thanks for the great foods!
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"One of my favorite cafes in the city. The staff is super friendly, their cold pressed juices are refreshing, and they have comfortable seating and free wifi. Would also highly recommend their Zucchini bread and butter croissants."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"A fantastic family run neighborhood cafe. Great for staples like croissants and coffee, with some really amazing specialties- try their lavender banana bread as a sweet treat or their pulled pork sandwich for lunch. The staff are super friendly and the space is lovely."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,This is one of the best avocado melt sandwiches and salads I’ve ever had. The coffee is top tier and on par with 3rd wave.  Window seat is delightful and internet good.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"My favorite low key spot in SF to get breakfast and lunch. Everything is extremely fresh, juice is fresh pressed, coffee very high quality. The service is amazingly nice and on top of everything, and well priced for what you get."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Breakfast is fresh, delicious and the staffs are so welcoming. Very clean and the price is just right for the food you ordering."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Friendly staff, great espresso and coffee, a definite place to stop for your morning or afternoon needs. They also have great homemade juices and food!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Cute arty cafe. Stumptown nitro cold brew was great. Coffee 5. Food 4. Atmosphere 5. Service 5. Free WiFi.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Price: above average WiFi: can handle HD video for a couple people. About 35MB/s download speed. Value: genuinely good quality for the price Food: I had the morning bun and it was incredibly flaky. Definitely recommend
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Lovely art! Building  space huge,  staff was friendly and kind. Very helpful with choices. Will go back, indoor /outdoor seating an close to a park! Had a tasty grilled cheese and a Americano."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"I had a beautiful Cobb salad today! Well portioned, fresh and delicious. The hard boiled egg was perfect - a barely solid center, the bacon was cut lardon style and not overly crispy, the dressing was well coated but subtle and the avo super fresh. I'm 3x/weeker and never disappointed!  Thanks Crew, you rock!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Fantastic coffee and incredible sandwiches! Their cold-pressed juice is always fresh and there’s plenty of workspace at this Mission favorite. The staff and the owners make the cafe a complete joy!
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Excellent breakfast spot, with beautifully crafted and delicious sliders (or buns really). We stopped by chance as Stable was closed and couldn’t be happier with our discovery!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Great place for late night food! Came here on the last night of my stay in NYC and ordered the tuna tataki and super creamy tteokbokki. The tteokbokki was mixed with heavy cream candied cocoa nibs and personally one of the best tteokbokki I've ever had. Would definitely come again when I'm around!
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"I enjoy this coffee shop a lot. The outdoor seating is really peaceful. The interior, which shares space with an art gallery, is great as well. I usually order a coffee and the almond butter and banana toast, which is great. They frequently have donuts as well."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Great coffee and the people are so kind 😊 The almond zucchini bread is delicious …
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Great food. Drinks are freshly pressed and wonderful. Open  space, great work environment. Free WiFI."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Avocado toast that leaves enough money in your pocket to make your student loan payment. Cold brew that gently punches you in the face (with consent) so you can pretend your work is meaningful to you. WiFi, outlets, tables... in SF these are rarer than a street without broken glass and this place has got em! I would have given them 6 stars if they had nitro cold brew (because critical feedback is good for everyone except me I'm perfect)."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Very friendly café with fair pricing and a wide selection for your breakfast/lunchtime Dolores Park visit! Grilled cheeses for $5, smoothies for $6, and tea's for $4!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"It wasn't obvious what kind of cafe this is when I first visited. As I tasted more and more of what they make, it became obvious that this is a special place. They are committed to high quality ingredients and interesting flavors. Don't let the decor fool you, this cafe serves excellent food and drinks."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Big, beautiful, open cafe. Deliscious gluten free brownies & ginger chai latte. Also, the first thing I noticed when I sat down was all the women there were wearing little to no makeup, so the customer-type is very refreshing. Everyone seemed to be laid-back yet working well. :) Decent WiFi & a few outlets if needed."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Nice place! Friendly staff -- had a delay with my order and they gave me a free bread pudding to make up for it! Delicious coffee and pastries.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"A coffeeshop next to the ODC Theater. Very clean and sophisticated interior. A respectable food selection. Nerdy patrons, they help sustain the work atmosphere. On the negative side, the place feels too much like a theater coffeeshop, not like a regular coffeeshop that you would hang out in. The opening hours are very limited. And the worst, the order took long, and then they even got me a wrong order - that was rather frustrating."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"This might be my new favorite cafe. Free wifi, killer friendly staff, good music, comfy seating, great coffee. Will for sure be coming back. The drip coffee was a bit over priced but can't complain too much."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Nice open atmosphere, great natural lighting, quiet enough to get some work done. The staff is friendly, the coffee is good, and the avocado toast is everything people say it is."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Great coffee, great staff. Excited to try the food next time as everyone around me seemed to be loving it. Very San Fransisco Arthouse Coffeeshop vibe that anyone could easily fall in love with. Nice to be in San Fran now!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Robin's Cafe is my favorite coffee shop in the Van Ness area.  The staff are friendly, coffee is great, and the place is spacious.  It's an all around great place to sit down and get work done."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Good espresso & tunes, no crowds early weekdays"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"I’ve always been pleased with the quality of the food here, as well as the service, regardless of whether I dine in or take out. The coffee also stands out."

Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Don’t make assumptions, always anatomize a situation before you postulate. The world judges people enough. It’s not good to go to a cafe that does the same. Get over yourself!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Delicious food and juices. I regularly come here for lunch or late breakfast.
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,The avocado toast is so good here. I dream of the buttery perfectly baked toast with chunks of salt and pepper
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Minus a star for the price of food, but otherwise a sweet spot to grab some coffee and get some work done.  Staff is very friendly."
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,"Fairly priced food and a great place to grab a coffee + work.  Attentive staff, fast internet and an awesome playlist as well!"
Robin's Café,3153 17th St #1332,Their fresh squeezed orange juice and Cuban sandwiches are amazing. I love this place
