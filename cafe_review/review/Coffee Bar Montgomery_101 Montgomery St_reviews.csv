Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"The coffee here is very good, you can tell everything is measured and carefully made. You can also taste it in the final product too. I’ve been getting the iced latte (rotating between their house made caramel or vanilla syrups) for over a year and it’s consistently been great each time and never varies.  It’s one of the best coffee in FiDi for sure!"
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Pleasant baristas! For my small latte /oat milk, I paid $7.22 and it came in a small macchiato cup since I asked for regular Vs paper. Can’t use water glass m, has to be paper cup…No sitting…There’s a tiny standing bar at the corner… Good coffee but given quality of experience with restrictions, they should adjust their price.  I think milk and coffee is generally overpriced in coffee shops… I’m surprised ppl are still going to coffee shops to just get coffee. I see value only as meeting spaces… The drop of oat milk does not warrant the 1.25$ add."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"If you appreciate a great cup of coffee, you'll love this place. Their beans are always fresh, and you can really taste the difference. I also appreciate that they offer a variety of brew methods. Their pour-over coffee is a must-try."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Amazing cup of coffee made with love and care. Their Neopolitan is well balanced.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Coffee Bar is hands down the best spot for coffee in the Financial District. Their brews are simply amazing. I really hope they stick around because they're awesome!
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,The Havana latte was delicious and well made with the condensed milk properly mixed in - no thick syrup layer at the bottom of the cup.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"4 stars only because the hours are wrong and we’ve gone multiple times only to be burned by it being closed. It’s almost always closed when we go, and we are craving a coffee fix so we have to turn to the nearby blue bottle, so I’ve decided to add the new hours here for others. Although it is no longer summer, these hours seem to be the correct ones, hopefully things don’t change again 🤔  Otherwise, it’s great coffee and I’d highly recommend!!"
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"To start the coffee beans are $27 per pound. That is a big price for mediocre coffee. Bought a half pound of Neapolitan beans, featuring a medium dark roast. Flavor notes say dark chocolate,  hazelnut and caramel. Couldn't detect any of those flavor notes even remotely. Made the coffee at home using a Baratza Encore grinder and a Bodum French Press. Really lacking any richness or body. Tasting it the one word that came to mind was ordinary. Contacted the owner BEFORE trying the beans about their return policy. She explained to me it could be possible on a case by case basis, but would not accept a return just because you don't like the flavor profile. There in lies the problem, to me this coffee doesn't have a flavor profile. Coffee Bar uses Mr. Espresso beans which are fire roasted. Philz Coffee is way better. Caffe Trieste is 50 times better. So now I'm stuck with a half pound of beans I paid over $13 for and I don't even want to drink it. I do not recommend the Coffee Bar on Montgomery Street"
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Not every coffee shop deserves a 5 start. This one has the great coffee and great people who works here. They brought me the coffee and energy. Don’t hesitate if you see this place just come! Thank you
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Good taste and fresh. I recommend caramel latte!
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,No wifi but coffee is good
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,I work a block away and cannot get myself to go anywhere else for coffee. The quality and taste here are unmatched! Probably the best vanilla latte I’ve ever had. You can tell the care that goes into making their house made syrups. The baristas are always friendly too!
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,One of the best caramel latte I ever had. I would highly recommend.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Regarding the owners reply: Man you get 4 star and I am drinking Coffee all over the world. You say homemade syrup you shall be okay with 4 stars. What kind of coffee would have syrup. Anyways, I am sure it was your cafe and it is a decent place, just be open to feedback.  Cappuccino was okay nothing special though! Almond Croissant was delicious and I got surprised by the fact that it was topped with an almond cookie."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,I stopped by during a business trip and fell absolutely in love with their horchata cold brew. Also their vanilla latte is amazing - you can really taste the difference with the store made syrup
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Tastiest orange creamsicle downtown with all natural flavors.  Drive from Soma for these!
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Aussies, this place has chocolate powder for your cappuccinos! Generally quite a long line during peak hours times, but it moves quickly."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"The sign outside had a bold claim: Coffee Bar’s Orange creamsicle latte is better than Peet’s vanilla latte next door. Well, quite disagree, Coffee Bar’s latte was flavorless (and the staff was busy talking between them and barely said hi). Don’t make bold claims if you’re not 100% sure your consumers agree! The sign has changed recently by the way."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Coffee Bar is a real treat! The staff always greets you with a smile and is really efficient at making your drink in a timely fashion. Their cafe cubano (I think that was the name) is just epic! Prices are good for the area as well. Cool atmosphere although this location is small there are some seats outside should you choose to sit for a bit.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Best coffee I've had in San Fran after  three days of being here.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Coffee here is a little pricier than your average cafe, but it's really strong and has good flavor. I like getting the Americano and Havana Latte. If you're in a hurry in the morning you can go to the left and get their drip for $2. They have a convenient jar for their pay and go system so you don't have to wait in line."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"While I usually stick to black coffee, the bittersweet hot chocolate (Rechiutti) is worth the splurge, especially on a cold July day.  Have to agree that the staff here is exceptionally friendly, always accommodating my indecisiveness with a smile. They also do a great job of answering questions about their beans without making you feel like a rube on his first trip to a fancy coffee shop. Lots of smiles and enthusiasm make it a nice afternoon getaway in the FiDi."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"There are plenty of good coffee places in the Financial District, and this is definitely one of them! Their seating is limited, but the drinks are excellent. For a change of pace, check out their Havana Latte!"
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"If you're looking for a slow cup of coffee in the FiDi, wait in line here.  But if you're looking for a quick cup of coffee, walk in with $2 cash and drop it in the bowl and help yourself to the self service station right at the front.  Quick and convenient for a morning pick-me-up.  And the coffee is top notch!"
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Welcoming space for third wave coffee (using Mr. Espresso beans). The baristas are all pretty friendly and skilled. Another good SF coffee place to have in your back pocket if you're wandering around looking to sate your caffeine needs.  Pour over fans take note: pour overs are available starting at 8AM (presumably to better accommodate the morning rush).
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Fast, delicious flat white and cappuccino prepared by knowledgable coffee baristas on well-calibrated strada machines... what else do you want? How about a croissant to go with your coffee? Or a breakfast taco (veggie and vegan options available)? They got it all in this little coffee shop... Always looking forward to this place when I am in the area."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,drip coffee dark roast was rich and not bitter
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"This is probably the best coffee you can get in the financial district, and some of the best coffee you're going to get in the city.  Don't let the small, ""satellite cafe"" look of the place fool you.  They make really good stuff in here.   They serve cortados, also colloquially known as gibraltars in San Francisco, plus some other unusual things.  Try the havana latte; it's made with sweetened milk, and it's a one-of-a-kind taste that I love."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"A favorite coffee gem in the Mission. Since it's a bit south of the ""core of the Mission"" it's a bit off the beaten path but worth every minute of the trek. The coffee is delicious and the baristas genuinely care about their customers."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Coffee Bar brings together some of the best characteristics of a coffee shop. A nice atmosphere, good coffee, and wifi/outlets for the techies. I really like this chain and hope they continue to grow."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"It's pretty unbelievable that they charge $4 for a ""Vietnamese Iced Coffee"" when they don't freshly drip the coffee. They prepare a whole jug of Viet iced coffee and just pour it over ice.  Even the most hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese stores will charge $3 for a Freshly dripped viet iced coffee.  .. It really just seems like they're profiteering on a foreign concept that they are executing poorly. The cost would be more reasonable if they freshly drip the coffee, especially because I trust that Coffee Bar uses premium coffee beans, unlike hole-in-the-wall Viet restaurants."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,I adore this place. The iced lattes mean business and taste divine. The baristas are super friendly and the place is always immaculate. Just wish they had a frequent buyer punch card program.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"I once held the 4 square mayorship here and a streak of going here 35 days. Even then, after a few days I lost the mayorship. So fierce is the competition here.  The staff is super friendly, skilled and knowledgeable about coffee. I always get the cortado but they also serve coffee, lattes, cappucinos and kale juice. Yes, kale juice. You can get a light lunch here with coffee.  I like to sit outside and sometimes random conversation will happen with interesting people.  I love this place."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"I have never had a bad experience here! I actually go out of my way to make sure I get coffee from here. The only downside is the lack of internet and common area like they have at their other location. Otherwise, the staff is always kind and the coffee is always good."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Mom and pop shop walk right past Starbucks and into the doors of these wonderful people. Carmel from scratch and house made extracts. Hope this place is around a very long time
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Better than Starbucks or Peets. My daily favorite for coffee. Staff are polite and friendly. And it's nice to have a smile and conversation with your coffee.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Great tasting hand-crafted-with-love coffee every day, can’t start my day without it. Cafe de Olla is my go to"
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Artsy vibe solid cold brew
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,Great Latte. Milk was steamed just enough to make the milk taste sweet. Couldn't imagine what homemade syrups would be like.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,FiDi has like a 100 coffee bars in a small 1-mile radius in downtown SF. Coffee Bar is one of five that I walk by every day on my way to work. I’ve stopped by here a couple of times specially for their Horchata Cold Brew ($5) which is very good. I’ve also tried their Vietnamese Cold Brew ($4.25) which does not have the intense deep strong sweet taste of coffee that you expect from Vietnamese coffee. I’ve also tried their cappuccino with both regular and Almond milk and found it to be good but not great.  Like every other coffee place in FiDi at the peak morning hours expect a rush. Here it becomes a little pronounced as the place is very small and a lot of people end up standing close to the exit almost blocking it. I think they need to do a slightly better job of controlling the line and letting people move outside from where they can pick up their orders. Due to the rush I’ve not tried their hand crafted (pour over) coffee selection as the wait for that can be pretty long. The cashier and the baristas here are pretty good and treat patrons with respect (most coffee places in FiDi are like that except for Peets). Overall it’s a nice place for me to cheat on my regulat illy Café once in a while.
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,"Great small coffee bar with excellent coffee, love their latte. There are a few chairs on the sidewalk but otherwise get your coffee to go."
Coffee Bar Montgomery,101 Montgomery St,The coffee is amazing (roasted by Mr Espresso) and they make their own syrups. Fantastic attention to detail.
