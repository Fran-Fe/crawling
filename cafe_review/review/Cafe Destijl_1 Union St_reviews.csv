Cafe Destijl,1 Union St,"It always takes a long time to get your food here if you don't order ahead. Good food, huge portions, which is unnecessary. Slow but polite service, had to wait for my iced tea til after lunch once."
Cafe Destijl,1 Union St,"agreed, be ready to wait if you come during lunchtime! De Stijl (pronounced De Steel) slow-paced European style cafe. My goto here for lunch is the enchiladas; come with a yummy green salad and your choice of red or verde sauce - dericious!  their breakfast burrito is also pretty good - comes with a fruit salad - just a bit pricey"
