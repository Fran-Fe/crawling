Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,What a great surprise! Some in our group weren’t so sure by the outside but we decided to give it a try. The food was great and server was very friendly. Everyone gave their food 5 stars and said they would come back.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Staff are efficient, friendly, helpful and nice. Appreciated that most were masked as well.  Unfortunately the Pho was lackluster as the broth was bland and the noodles stuck together. Everything was packed well for takeout and they remembered the hot sauce, napkins and utensils.  I remember the food being much better the previous time I was there so this visit was disappointing. Would try again and get something else."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Amazing breakfast place … we were bored of eating the same breakfast at the hotel, decided to give this place a try and boy we were not disappointed. They were busy but the kitchen and the staff was very efficient. Each table was getting equal attention and the coffee mugs were being filled just in time.  Not to mention the food was amazing the first reason this place gets a five star."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Our favorite breakfast spot! The food is delicious, has good portions, and is reasonable. The staff is friendly and efficient. They are close to the pier. They also serve pho, noodles, fried rice, etc... Please give them a shot. You won't be disappointed!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Their Veggi Eggs Benedict with hash brown is delicious 😋 . They are very generous with coffee ☕️.  Loved the dine in experience
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Sat down for lunch not your normal Cafe it is heckit fast pace, everything happening. The meals were beautiful more dryer as in moisture but full of flavour had fried rice and noodles beautiful delightful full tasting meal. Recommend to everyone"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Nice little breakfast and lunch diner right near Fisherman's wharf and close to where we stayed. Nothing flash but quick service and nice choices. Ordered the special egg and Bacon sandwich on English muffin. They offered cheese but we found they charged us $1.50 extra per sandwich for it 😕. Coffee was good. Nice staff.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Writing in real time....9:30 on a weekday, midsummer. Not sure if we did something offensive coming in or something else , but the server literally did not say 1 word he didn't have to, including hello. Breakfast menu is limited, especially if you don't eat eggs.  Now our food has arrived. We ordered pancakes, sausage, and country potatoes, as well as an eggs Benedict. All were very good. The cooks are clearly well experienced. The server who dropped it off was friendlier but we won't be back for the rest of our stay or recommend."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Literally some of the best fried rice I’ve ever had!! Super fast service and super nice staff and accommodating! Would highly recommend everyone try! Something for everyone here! Vietnamese coffee is authentic too!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The food was just okay. The prices are good and portions are huge. I thought the banh mi veggies were too vinegary. I've had better sandwiches. My daughter really enjoyed her breakfast. It is convenient if you're looking for a quick breakfast spot. They were not busy at all. There is outdoor seating if you're not vaxxed.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Nice place for a feed without the crowds of Fisherman's wharf nearby. Really nice service
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Darren’s Café was so delicious and loved being able to get breakfast or lunch. The BBQ Chicken Pho was amazing for brunch.  With kids in tow this place had something for everyone! The waiter was super friendly and we felt so at home. My only suggestion is for bigger napkins.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Delicious food. The staff is a bit overwhelmed at times and often needs to be reminded of what they missed bringing. The place is clean and they do a great job with breakfast. I did have to wait a solid ten minutes for my fork and knife once the food arrived so that was unfortunate.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Visited San Fran for a few days. It was close by to our hotel so we had breakfast here, loved it and ended up there before our morning flight just cause it was that good. My husband and I absolutely loved this place. Highly recommend!!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great breakfast for a little place. No bathrooms as far as I could tell. I asked for water and coffee and just got coffee, and my husband asked for water a few times before he got it. I guess they don’t want you to have two drinks at a time? That’s the only reason I took off a star."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Food: I got the Popeye with hash browns. It's American breakfast dining, so nothing to rave about, especially for the price.  Gluten: The options for gluten free are the egg dishes, without the bread, and you can sub for a good quality fruit dish for an upcharge. The Vietnamese dishes weren't an option due to the fish sauce they use.  Service: My server was kind and curious to learn about gluten.  Atmosphere: It has an open kitchen, but otherwise, nothing notable."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Highly recommend this place for breakfast.  The food was terrific, the service was friendly and quick even though they were very busy at the time.  We were a little pressed for time but they got us in and out and fed a delicious breakfast."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Very friendly and clean place with excellent, attentive service and an Asian flair. Highly recommended."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great breakfast! Good service!!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great place for breakfast. Although the space is small, the food is outstanding with really large servings. The service is quick too. Loved their French toast combo,coffee and potatoes on the side."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Popped in here for breakfast last month.  I had an awesome pancake combo with coffee! Would definitely recommend!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Had the crab Benedict, it was phenomenal! Would love to come back to try the rest of the menu, everything looked wonderful. Service was fast and the staff was friendly, highly recommended"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"This place was such a delightful surprise for my husband and me. The food was absolutely delicious and perfect for a couple where one loves Asian and one loves American foods. Also there is delicious Vietnamese coffee, so good!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We had eggs benedict for breakfast, possibly the best I ever had! Just had to come back for lunch for the BBQ chicken pho (Vietnamese soup). Again, absolutely delicious! Service was super thoughtful and friendly as well."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Very good breakfast food, good variety. Crab Benedict was delicious. Great service as well - very friendly and attentive staff."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I ate here a few time during the summer a while back, and it just occurred to me to write a review. This place is amazing. I had the Pho both times I was here, and it was genuinely some of the best Pho I've had in my life. Where I live, there's a bunch of different Vietnamese places that do really good Pho, but none of them do it as good as the Pho I had at this Cafe. I'll definitely come here again the next time I visit San Francisco  10/10, would eat again."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Excellent food, very friendly staff. Reasonably priced. Glad we found this place. Very accommodating to our food requests."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Better food and prices than most places in the area. The country potatoes are amazing, and my wife's poached egg was perfectly cooked."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Hole in the wall! Great food so many options. Cheap. Will be back for more food when we get in town
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Excellent breakfast spot. Serves breakfast all day. The Bay Area omlet is amazing.  It has baby shrimp, spinach, mushroom and Swiss cheese. And the price point is only $13.95 includes potatoes and bread. I recommend the sourdough."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Loved loveddd this café! The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. The soups are the best!!!!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,I took another Google reviews advice and got the fried rice.... yes it was good. Nice dinner.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"My family was visiting from NJ and we wanted to have a good hot brunch. Walked through Fishermans Wharf until this establishment caught my mother in law attention. We had a small Havanese dog with us and it was great that they were pet- friendly. We ordered everything from corn beef with eggs, pho with beef, the chicken /steak combination and all the food was great and served hot. Very quick service and servers were all friendly and professional. Strongly recommend this resto."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Service is Great , even greatest, the service was fast courteous, friendly , Food was very good , generous plates, for reasonable price.  My Wife and I was in San Francisco for a 3 days weekend"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Right off the get go...once you enter the place, it’s a bit small, but you already know it’s going to be delicious breakfast. Indeed, this place has great reviews for a reason. Good service, and not too far from the Piers. 5/5"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, fast, filling and reasonably priced. Well located within Fisherman’s Wharf.  We went here twice during our visit to SF."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Crab benedict was delicious! The service was super fast! The food came out in like 10 minutes! Will definitely be back!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Very fast service and really tasty food! Prices are very fair for the Marina. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. They even offered to get a water bowl for our dog! There are heaters outside, which helps a lot as it can get quite windy."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Awesome diner for breakfast. Thr fried country potatoes may be the best I ever had. If staying in the area, you should try it."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I had the dungeness crab omelet.I came to San Francisco to eat dungeness crab! It was pricey , but worth it. I ended up not eating my sourdough toast or hash brown. I was too full. The portions are generous!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Loved this place! The food is great,  the Phos are excellent! Lovely family run place that makes sure you leave happy."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great food with fantastic service!  Went there 4 days in a row during our visit to SF
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Best place to have lunch around this touristy area. Good prices, service and food quality. Yum yum"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The food and service are AMAZING.  We ordered phö and a rice plate to share and INSTANTLY decided we'd be taking all our meals here. Presentation isn't fancy - restaurant isn't fancy, but food is EVERYTHING. Ask for David when you come because he made great suggestions and guided us through his favorite dishes, and we were NOT disappointed."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The food is great! There’s a good mix of American and Asian food, and both of them are made very well. Good and quick service, food came out under 10 minutes after we ordered with a party of 5. The atmosphere is cozy with indoor and outdoor seating. If you’re looking for a breakfast or lunch place in San Fransisco, this would be my first choice!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Over price food 30$ for 6 egg rolls
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Had breakfast here at Darren's, great service, excellent food and I asked for crispy hashbrowns and they actually did it. I had the seafood scramble and my wife had the popeye scramble. It is very close to pier 39 so the prices are better. They also offer vietnamese food options so you can get lots of different food either beef, chicken or seafood."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I had the BEST experience at Darren's Café!  First, the customer service was excellent!  We encountered one of the best hostess and in conversation we found out she was only volunteering and provided such friendly and professional service.  Second, the food was absolutely DELICIOUS!  We're from New York and the French toast was best I've ever had in my life!  I didn't want my experience to end.  I spoke with the owner to compliment his food and his staff.  He was also very glad and kind.  Thank you for the memorable experience!!!😊😊😊"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"A busy popular breakfast spot just off Fishermans’ Wharf  This small cafe was busy even at 9 in the morning. We were lucky to arrive when we did, because ten minutes later people were queuing on the street outside for breakfast. By the time we left there were 10 people in the queue, but the wait will have been worth it.  My breakfast called a Popeye Scramble, was named for the cartoon character, it was just what Popeye would have ordered, rich spinach with its iron flavour, going well with minced (or ground as they say here) beef in scrambled eggs, with lovely juicy potatoes and spring onions.  My partner opted for Corned beef hash and two eggs. My partner felt this was a perfect mix of corned beef and potatoes in the hash. Both breakfasts came with toast  white for my partner, sourdough for me."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"This place was a bit of a surprise. My husband and I headed to Fisherman's Warf for some lunch. I was set on seafood so we had to stop somewhere to get him something first (He doesn't eat seafood). We saw this cafe and thought perfect a quick sandwich! Guess again! This place had such a unique menu. The prices were a little crazy but we were in the thick of a tourist area so we get it. The food was very good and the menu was so diverse. It was American and Vietnamese. Even though I was eating my lunch soon I couldn't resist and ordered the summer roll. It was so nice and fresh, my husband had the grilled chicken sandwich and he said that was also fresh and tasty."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"10/10 honestly, great food, service, lots of choices, and overall great prices for even better food"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Excellent little spot for a quick breakfast with fast and really polite service! I had blue berry pancakes with bacon and eggs was really good!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"So very good! Awesome service and super duper tasty food!!!! You must go! From American breakfast to Vietnamese dishes, you can't go wrong!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"In trying to avoid hipster $15 breakfast options we were on our way to Denny's when we walked upon Darren's. Tons of options, great portions and prices. Most of all we enjoyed the incredible service at our street side table. Really impressed at team work of staff. Great meal and way to start a day in the city by the bay!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Very tasty Eggs Benedict Florentine (added tomato & mushrooms) to start the day in SF. New find for us and we'll be back.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great place for Breakfast. Polite and efficient staff. Thoroughly recommend.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,It's a good place if you want to get quickly. People here are very friendly. I normally like chow mein and rice plate here. But today tried the fried rice which was salty so giving 4 stars.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Their pho was ok, and their fried rice was mediocre. They seemed to spread themselves out to thin, offering a full menu of American breakfast as well as many Vietnamese dishes."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Delicious Pho! Very close quality to what I have tried in Vietnam!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Friendly staff and chicken fried steak to die for. Reasonably priced. If you're in the area I highly recommend
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Cool little spot for good eats. Came here for breakfast and ended up ordering the pho. I had the spicy pho and my fiancee got the seafood pho. Have to say it was the best we've ever had. I highly recommend this place. They have all kinds of different food options and while eating here and looking around at others, all the food looked great and everyone looked pleased."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The breakfast is amazing! Great value for the price and pancakes are so big and fluffy. Service is super quick.  Although the coffee was horrible. It was so burnt I could almost taste charcoal.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Amazing breakfast. Friendly staff and tasty food.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Good place for breakfast (waffle and eggs were great) this time I just had a coffee sitting on the sidewalk on a beautiful morning. Staff is attentive and recognized me from a visit a couple weeks ago.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Darren and team were really wonderful!  I was initially taken aback by the pricing but it ended up being money well spent.  The service was amazing and the food was top notch!  My kids loved the pancakes and French toast while my wife and I fell in love with eggs Benedict and omelette.  The ingredients are bought fresh daily and you can tell.  Darren was an exceptional host/owner and made us feel like we were in his home.  Wished we lived closer because we would be regulars!!!  Thank you Darren and team!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Had a good breakfast and their service is really nice. Don’t go there for the ambiance but for some good and reasonably priced breakfast.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Menu is available all day, if I remember correctly. Service was quick. Food was hot. Staff is friendly"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Consistently good food preparation. Great classic breakfast and lunch choices.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,This restaurant serves all American Breakfasts and Vietnamese Dishes. Odd combo but it works.  Vietnamese Iced Coffees hit the spot. We had Pho and Rice dishes and they were faaaaaannnn-tas-tic! My favorite was the Satay Beef Noodle Soup and Lemon Grass on rice. Super flavourful.  Great service. Fresh food. Family friendly. Clean. Would definitely come again.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, good portions.  Had breakfast and would definitely go back again.  The staff was very attentive and friendly."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"So many options! My whole family found food they liked, and the prime spot in SF was super nice. The front patio was great for people watching."

Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Must grab breakfast before starting the bus tour 👍 hop on hop off bus office just beside the restaurant …
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Amazing french toast, we came two days in a row on our vacation. The staff was great and the menu has lots of options. Try the mimosas!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"My wife and I ate there and fell in love with place and the food. Never had any bad food. The staff was wonderful and really made you feel welcome. On our next trip back from Michigan, we will definetly stop again. Anyone visiting San Francisco, this is a worthwhile."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We stopped here on a recent visit to San Francisco  for lunch when we took the tram. We were pleasantly surprised by how nice the food was and generous the servings were. This was topped by the staffs pleasantries, they were very nice and welcoming. I highly recommend this place."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The food was surprisingly really good. Location is good but not scenic. The burger was serious good... ordered it medium, and it was arguably medium well but still REALLY good. The French toast was quite good also. Recommend that. Only tip is skip the soda... the kid got a lemonade which was $4.95. Should have forced him to drink water. Still deserves 5 stars. Great place!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Breakfast Potatoes are GREAT!! Pancakes are very fluffy!!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Been there twice for breakfast and both times were awesome. Great friendly staff. Highly recommend!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, always full so a little wait to eat. Highly recommended 👌"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Stopped off for a quick coffee after a morning jog and was pleasantly surprised by a great bowl of oatmeal, clearly not just a simple prepackaged heat and serve. I missed the fact they offer iced Vietnamese coffee and ordered an iced latte, so the server gave it his best shot and it turned out pretty good. 5 stars for the friendly service."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"A GEM of a find in San Francisco! We ate breakfast 4 days in a row. Never a disappointment. David and his staff were amazing. Friendly, great service and the food was delicious!!! Thank you for making us feel so welcome!  Ted & Betty"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great place for breakfast before exploring Fisherman's Wharf.  The owner and staff work hard, the place is clean, the service is pleasant  and the food is good, from conventional breakfast items to Vietnamese pho."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The burgers are fat and juicy. Every time I get lunch here it is always crowded yet they still get my orders to go very fast. The staff greet you by name and are very nice. Last but not least the prices are extremely reasonable considering the tourist location. Must eat here if in the area
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Absolutely delicious and clean. Great service, super friendly.  Can’t wait to return."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"These folks are fantastic. We waited a bit in line, but once we sat down, service was super quick. The staff is very nice and accommodating, and the food was excellent. The country fried steak and eggs is a must have. If you can’t decide on what to get, I recommend it."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Amazing. The staff are great and they were very sweet. Fell in love the minute we walked in. Breakfast and coffee were amazing. Kids loved every minute. The waiter was very friendly and the owner was very welcoming.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"EXCELLENT!!!  We had the pork vermicelli (added an egg roll), chicken fried steak, French toast combo, and the chow mein combo.  All turned out very yummy!  Loved the options on the menu.  Service was speedy.  Definitely would recommend it. Oh, and street parking was available right across the street (at 915 on a Saturday morning)."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,I had a chicken soup from the morning and it was soo big and delicious!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"At the risk of ruining this gem on the wharf for ourselves; Love Darren's! Service is friendly and great. Good food and it comes fast. Our first day in SF Wharf area we tried another place and waited over an hour for food, it arrived room temp and was over priced. Not so at Darren's. Fast, reasonably priced and HOT.  Traditional breakfasts and lunches plus a Vietnamese menu too. Huge thumbs up."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Friendly , fast , good food and was happy ."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,I had the basic breakfast and it was very good.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The variety of food here is pretty ridiculous. Vietnamese food WITH American breakfast? What more can you ask for? We got French Toast with some Vietnamese noodles. How cool is that?! The service was pretty great initially but then it trailed off. Right when we needed it. We didn't need them pestering us for our order every minute. But when we ordered two entrees and wanted extra plates/bowls, they somehow disappeared. And didn't think that we would even need extra plates/bowls.  Either way, the food was great and the service was okay in the end. Place is reasonably big and wasn't too crowded (we got a seat immediately). I have and will definitely come back here again."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I don't usually get orange juice, but my wife and daughter were raving about the freshly squeezed orange juice, so I got one for myself. I was not disappointed. The kids don't usually eat much of a breakfast, but they were all over this food. ""Best pancakes I've ever had."" ""Best French toast I ever ate."" Kept us fed for a long, busy morning."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Nice place, nice people.. typical greasy spoon… pricey but we are in SFO! Breakfast potatoes a little salty… French toast yummy!!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"My breakfast wasn't fancy - eggs over easy, two pancakes, and smoked bacon - but at Darren's Café it tasted like a gourmet meal. The eggs were perfect, the pancakes delicious and stood up to the maple syrup, by which I mean they didn't get soggy, and the bacon, which I asked to be crisp, was cooked to that perfect crispness that gives it a perfect blend of crunch and melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. I never thought eggs, bacon , and pancakes could make me wax poetic but Darren's Café worked breakfast magic. Yum!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,the staff is friendly... food was very tasty
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The sate pho and others food my kids ate are so delicious.  I love when I see The kitchen of the restaurant is so clean. I feel safe to eat there. They have an excellent service.  The owner is very friendly and caring about his customers.  He went out and ask us how is the food I would highly recommend to everyone. Annie
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Service was outstanding prices were reasonable and food was well prepared and delicious!!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,AMAZING FOOD EVERY TIME I TRAVEL FROM THE VALLEY THIS A MUST SINCE 2007

Would highly recommend to everyone! High quality and fast! Thanks to the staff at Darren’s for a great start to the day!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great ""local"" feeling small and busy breakfast spot near the wharf. Nice, family run business, good service and food."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We ordered a breakfast item, a lunch item and Pho - all on the same ticket for our meal. Everything was hot, fresh, delicious and served with a smile. Absolutely impressed with this hidden gem. Excellent service, portions, food and a solid value."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great place to grab lunch. Noodle soups hits the spot Everytime. My lady friends that I bring rave about their bbq chicken. Rice plates are excellent. I better not forget to mention the breakfast plates, everything I've ordered has not disappoint me yet."

Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great food
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"This place is awesome! Best breakfast place I have found yet. They don't over do their food or try to get fancy. They are the prime example for sticking to the basics and delivering an amazing meal. To top it off food was ordered and ready within minutes, hot and ready to eat! I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good breakfast!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The food and service here was great. Although it we busy servers were attentive and patient. Free coffee refills  quickly. The American style breakfast was delicious. It's not on the corner but walk down halfway past the shops and its there. The washrooms are public so you have to walk around the corner or through the kitchen curtains. Just saying. ;)
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Ate breakfast here, french toast, eggs Benedict etc. Good food at good prices. Good service. Also serve a mix of Asian foods. Plenty locals using it which is always a good indicator. Inside and outside seating."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Good breakfast and fast, friendly service."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Definitely tired of hotel food and Darren's hit the spot. Great food and staff
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great breakfast!!! Service was great and staff was very welcoming !!!  Must try for breakfast or brunch !!!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The food is usually pretty good I'm friends with the head chef and he is definitely a hard working great cook. But sometimes all the food taste of fish because I don't think they clean the grill very good occasionally ? Not to deter anyone from eating there. The did is good and they are very friendly people
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"As always, this gem of a place never disappoints. A must if you're near the Pier 39 area."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Best breakfast in Fisherman Wharf area. Fresh, consistent quality. Good Amercan standards plus excellent Vietnamese Pho (noodle soup)! Eating here for ten years."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,This place is fantastic. The wife and I were checking the menu and it has american style breakfasts AND Vietnamese cuisine. Definitely worth trying.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We were going somewhere else. But they were closed... thankfully, this place is great! Friendly staff and food was awesome. Really a great place for breakfast. Hard to find a good restaurant in San Francisco, this is one of them!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great food at a pretty fair price for the area. Food was fast and service was good too.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Came here 3 times in a row when we stayed in San Francisco. Food and service was extremely good would 100% recommend.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Best place if, like in my case, your wife is Asian and loves a spicy noodles soup for breakfast while you are more of 'eggs and bacon' kind of guy. Food selection and quality is good, but nothing wow-ish. Service is very good and fast. The place gets busy around 9am but not crowded to the point that people have to wait. I like their American coffee over other diners coffee in the area."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Huge breakfast, possibly the best value we had in San Francisco, quickly served, hot and exactly as we asked for our eggs to be cooked."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Love having the beef pho and cafe sua da for breakfast!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Delicious breakfast! Large portions (enough to share). Prices within range for location. Staff very friendly.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Had a good breakfast there, decent portions and good service."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Everyone of the employees had a mask covering their face except one person…he was cooking and walking all around. Great tasting food…but show some respect to your customers and wear  your mask properly until we get a grip on Covid-19. Thanks
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"First of all, sorry no pics. I had the combination omelet, hash browns and English muffin. My wife had the French toast with bacon, and our son had the English muffin sandwich. We all finished our food and that is a rarity. We will be back."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Food was good a mix of American and Vietnamese. Service was excellent. 4 star since some of orders were canceled die to unavailability. If it's on the menu it's got to be on the table. But whatever was served it was nice.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great staff, passable food, convenient compared to other places that often have a line. Unfortunately we had a cleanliness issue while we were there. The staff did handle it quickly, and make a small gesture to compensate, but the issue was severe enough that I have to rate it this way. For the sake of the business (and the likely common nature of the issue for eateries in this area) I will not post specifics, but it was more than just a dirty spoon."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Food was really good! Service was great!  Close to the hotel and good prices.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Located one block from Fishermen's Wharf. They serve breakfast and lunch, including some Vietnamese food. Close at 2. Reasonable prices for San Francisco and generous portions of food."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Good pancakes good service, chill place"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"This little spot is excellent. There are plenty of traditional American breakfast selections (e.g. omelets, pancakes, french toast, eggs over easy, bacon, sausage, etc). There are also other delicious offerings such as fresh homemade noodles in various dishes and egg rolls and pho. You will find great food at great prices. You can't go wrong at Darren's."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Lovely food and friendly staff, reasonably priced.... highly recommend breakfast here when in fishermans wharf."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Did breakfast our last day in San Francisco, surprisingly good, I will eat here again."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The food was soo good and my husband absolutely loved the pho. I've tried pho before and wasnt a fan, but these guys know how to flavor the broth and I will now get a bowl whenever I comeback from now on! I will only eat pho from them! Thanks love the Asian guy and white girl. Lol 😆 …"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Decent alternative to other breakfast joints in Fisherman's Wharf that had massive lines.  Has an Asian menu in addition to classic American breakfast. I had the Chicken and Pork Rice Combo (it was excellent) and my girlfriend had a french toast combo (which she enjoyed).  If you can, try to get seated outside because the kitchen is in the dining area and pretty loud."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Never seen anything like it. A pho spot that serves breakfast all day. It was good, but not to the point where I'd make sure to come back again. The pho was missing salt but otherwise flavorful. Country fried steak was good but again not worth going back for. All in all, it's a great option for folks staying in fisherman's wharf."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I live nearby and hit Darrens regularly for lunch and dinner and am always so impressed. The range of foods they make, from American breakfast and sandwiches, to their Pho and rice dishes, it’s always perfect and super fast and the wait staff are the friendliest and most professional. Each one acts like it’s their restaurant which really makes a difference. (Maybe that’s the case. Maybe they’re family?) Highly recommend!!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,It was really good chicken vermicelli that we had here along with the four cheese sandwich. Recommended for breakfast! It was conveniently located near fisherman’s wharf and we came here for breakfast before heading for the hoponhopoff tour.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Friendly staff. Affordable. Coffee always filled. Tasty food. Quick. Centrally located. Pho is bomb. Came here two mornings is a row with two young kids. Everyone at everything. Tip: split a full breakfast combo between 2 kids. $5 and change per kid.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,We stayed near Fisherman Wharf and found Darren's Cafe while walking around in the morning. Great find . Good food and friendly service. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Love this place... was the first place we stopped after a long day of travel and check in at the Hyatt right next door.  Comfort food,  while we decompressed while we were there.  They have everything you want, and while the place is basic, it was busy enough... The staff was quick, and efficient ...  easy to find, and decent food... if you are in the area and want to get away from the expensive tourist food at the Pier... well worth it..."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Omg such good breakfast. We're still sitting at the table and I had to come review. Lots of food for a great price. Such fast service too!! We're so happy we stopped in here.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"One of the more moderate priced food places, in an area of jacked prices.  Servers were friendly, food was good. Ate breakfast at an early time (8ish-9) on a Tuesday and there was no wait. Would definitely dine again when in the area."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great little place, nothing fancy, with a selection of American, Chinese and Vietnamese dishes.  Very handy when each family member (7) wants something different for lunch!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Eggs were fluffy, sausage had flavor, and the French toast was excellent! Can't really complain"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! this restaurant really doesn't stand out as you're walking by but if you stop and eat here the food is amazing. The portions are very generous and the service is great."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I've eaten here multiple times and food is great but the coffee---not so much. In a city with such great selection of coffee's I'd think they'd have an interest in having the coffee, which in my opinion compliments the food, taste great and consistent. I love Biscoff's coffee at Pier 39 and The Chowder Hut down the block from Darren's!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs. It was delicious and crispy. Service was good. Nice small restaurant near Pier 39. Price was reasonable. Would revisit again if Im in area.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We went there day 1 of our trip. We wanted to go back but they were closed for the holiday. 10/10, we will go back."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Reasonably priced lunch spot in a overpriced tourist area. A mix of American, Vietnamese and Chinese options. The pho and bahn mi are great, as are the classic sandwiches and burger. I'm a big fan of the potato salad too, and always go with it over the fries."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Awesome breakfast.  Best Vietnamese Coffee we’ve ever had.  Super fast service.  Food came out hot and fresh.  Highly recommend!!!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I've only eaten the pho here (usually the BBQ chicken or pork version).  Generally it's pretty good at a reasonable price. However, once I ordered the broth only, and it was incredibly clear without the noodles and pork in the soup that the broth is pretty 2-dimensional."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Not impressed. Food & service were uninspired & bland. Crab was on the menu but read not available (this place is 2 blocks from Fisherman's Wharf). And my pet peeve, the bill had prominently displayed recommendations for tipping.  Wow, so very annoying."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I use to eat here when I worked in sf, for 1 whole yr. The beginning the staff was not the friendliest, eventually the ladies came around when they saw me everyday,  the chefs were very nice. I'll give it to the open kitchen, food is mediocre, not something fancy."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We ate here every day while we were in San Francisco. The food was great and so was the service. Our group was diverse, 3 teenagers, their grandmother and great grandfather, and everyone loved it!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Service was wonderful, staff very friendly, food wonderful...we had breakfast here.."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Given it is close to Fisherman Wharf, this location provide fantastic breakfast/lunch/brunch, came here twice during our stay in San Francisco and tried both their western menu and asian menu, i would say both are top notch food given the condition. everything was cooked on order to order. fantastic pho with good soup base, crispy and juicy pork chop and bbq chicken, great eggs too when i went the other way, try their iced viet coffee to go."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Unfortunately, we were in a hurry to catch the next cable car tour. Not only did they bring out the food in a timely manner, never neglecting good service, but the food was outrageously delicious. The waiter couldn't have been more polite & hospitable."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"My husband and baby were looking for a place to eat around 10am. All the cafes were PACKED for breakfast so we decided to head back to fisherman's wharf and try our luck there. On our way down we stumbled across Darren's Cafe and OH... MY... GOD... the staff was AMAZING. The Pho (which my husband and I are obsessed with) was to die for. We've never had it with cilantro but it was WAY better than the basil we normally get from everywhere else. Let's just say we found a warm, welcoming new place to visit in San Francisco (which we travel to A LOT). Thank you so much for being where you are (perfect location) and for being one of the best Pho spots we've ever been too!!!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"I went there for lunch with friends last weekend.  The good:  Good service...  Very cute asian waitresses...  Food was tastey,  The bad:  They are really stingey with portion size.  Tiny little cheese buger, not enough fries, and limited to 3 refills on ice tea.  Overall it was good, and I'll eat there again."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"FAST, tasty and large portions! Vietnamese coffee is well-made!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"My wife and I went there with our 8 month old and the staff was great and the food was good! We had the chicken PHO. The only thing I would change is the chicken in the pho to chicken breast,  not shredded. No complaint though!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Delicious food. Hours are always changing and they turn you away if you get there with less than hour before they close. Was coming here every day for lunch when I was working in the area. Brought my family now twice and been turned away both times, so I won't be coming back. Shame, because the food is good."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Delicious food! Very courteous service. Ate here consecutive days, during vacation, at this awesome multicultural cuisine cafe!!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,When I say my glass was filled once I had their breakfast I'm so honest I loved the noodles never had them before in my life and they were really good 👍😋😌 my little ones loves sopita and caldos and this for her was another level I love all the veggies and extras it is so amazing my birthday at this time was complete 💕 please go I also had Vietnamese iced coffee ☕❤
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,I normally love this place. But this time we drove from far away  to be here. And they where out of the  Vermicelli noodles.  And they said it takes a whole day to cook. I goggled it and it says takes 5 minutes  I am really  upset that they don't  care to provide the customer w the food they have on the menu.  Highly disappointed.  I wont be coming  back.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great breakfast spot near Fisherman's Wharf.  Everything came out to us piping hot and the coffee was to die for!  Loved the fast & friendly service!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Nice environment, good coffee and nice service. The meal was great, but I overestimated my hunger and ask for the pile of chocolate chip pancakes - the reduced size was going to be more than enough."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Good eggs Benedict, but I went there for crab benedict and they said they didn't have anymore crab. Not something I'd expect to here on the wharf. And it was right after they opened. Nice sidewalk heaters though, but the homeless panhandles sours the outside experience a bit."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Good food. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices for standard breakfast fare. Neat American/Asian fusion vibe. Recommended by the local guy running the parking spot.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great coffee, great food, great service. We stayed in SF for 3 days 2 nights, every morning during the stay we had Darren’s cafe for our breakfasts. It just became to my NO. 1 breakfast place 😁 …"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Amazing egg rolls! Great Service! If your reading this review, you have to stop for breakfast or lunch! American to Asian food! You can tell this place has great management!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,We r in a group of 16 pax n they are quick in settling down each of us. Basically all the food we ordered are so yummy n also reasonably priced. Will definitely return to those place again and again.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, awesome staff. Very quick on service from the staff, i have never tried this type of Asian food and now I'm craving it every weekend, i wish there was a restaurant like this near my area."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Very good breakfast and fast service. Friendly staff. Pho looks good and lots of people eating it. American breakfast is very good and they keep your coffee cup filled.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Darren's Cafe serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  A three egg omelette was $11.95.  Which is reasonable considering their location.  They have all the breakfast staples as well as a number of asian food dishes."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great place and great service food and coffee great.... but nothing interesting or exceptional
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, great service! For a small group there's 10-20 mins of wait, could be longer for bigger groups. But if you plan for the wait time, you're not going to regret it."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"That was great for a quick tasty breakfast that wasn't too pricey. It's a small place, but nice people, decent food, and quick service."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Amazing food. Had the eggs and seafood scramble. Wow.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,First time here. Great place to eat at if your visiting! Food presentation was very well put and everything had good flavor to it.👍 …
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,If you are in a hurry this is a great spot.  Great variety everything from Pho to country fried steak and eggs.  Full menu served all day.  Reasonable prices and service.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Perfect for brunch.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Absolutely delicious breakfast and really kind staff! Highly recommend the chicken fried steak and gravy
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Close to out hotel and cheaper than the hotel's breakfast. Small place but no wait and food came quickly. Mom and I had tasty omelets with crispy hash browns and coffee. Will be back again!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The staff was so nice I was able to get in a couple of minutes before they opened to get some coffee, very accommodating! Food was fantastic as well! Thank you so much!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Nice little cafe just off pier 39. Good menu with wide variety of breakfast options.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great place for breakfast.  Fast service, great food.  And everyone very friendly.  Warm and welcoming.  Highly recommend."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Beef noodle soup regular portion came with only 2 thin slices of beef. And i asked for extra beef they said extra 2 $ at first then said extra beef is on the house. They need to add beef to regular portion otherwise its a rip off. I have been to many pho places.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Great food with a lot of choices. Good prices. Very friendly folks that give great service. Will definitely be back!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Amazing food I was skeptical at first because of the wide range of different types of food. I am so glad I gave them a try the best Asian noodle soups and breakfast ever.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Thank god we found this place!! The food was awesome, and the servers were so nice! We went 2 mornings in a row. We wish we had a breakfast place as good as this in Boston."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We love this place. Breakfast, chow mein. Yep and really good. 10 out of 10 would do again."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,We ate there the last 3 mornings. The food was good and the staff were attentive. Would recommend it to anyone visiting the San Francisco area
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Darren's is a great restaurant and you won't find nicer service anywhere.  They have a huge menu and there prices are really great.  Good job everyone.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Exactly what you want from a quaint sidewalk cafe service breakfast all day!
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Really good food! Great for traditional American food as well as Asian food! Eating inside was a tad tight, but other then that, everything was great"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Excellent Breakfast! Great service, best Cafe in the area!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"An early morning visit to Fisherman's Wharf wouldn't be complete without breakfast at Darren's Cafe. Everything, from the coffee to the pancakes, was served exactly as it should be, in my opinion. Darren's was a delicious start to my day of exploring San Francisco."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, big portions, fast service, low prices.  What more can you ask for?"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"The food at Darren’s Cafe is absolutely delicious! The staff is also very friendly, tending to your very need. My experience was amazing. Thank you!"

Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Amazing service, quantity and quality of food at great prices.  If you're in the Fisherman's Wharf neighborhood in San Francisco, eat here!"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"A place to stop for a quick breakfast.  Good service, but food's nothing fancy, hashbrowns seem to have been made out of boiled potatoes, tuna met very salty."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"If you like spicy food, try any dish with the Thai chilly. Careful though, it can be really spicy. Goes best with their fried rice."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"We had a really good lunch here.  It was a little busy, but we got in pretty quickly.  Did was good.  Price was OK... But this is sf so.... Yea"
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Best place to go in SF for a quality breakfast or lunch and not have to pay a fortune. Staff are really attentive and turn the place around quickly so you don't have too much of a wait during the peak times.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Lovely food and friendly staff.. Highly recommend
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Breakfast big and very tasty in medium price. Staff very nice and helpful. But coffee too expensive and not good (in my opinion).
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Wow. Fast, friendly, service.  Excellent pricing for San Francisco.  No waiting.  Can't wait to try their lunch menu."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Great food, and great service! Weekdays are the best when there aren't tons of tourists. The food cones out in about 5 minutes or less."

Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Delicious, no wait time. Quick and delicious. Not a far walk from hotels."

Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The Food is very good. We ate breakfast there 3 of 4 days. Very Friendly with quick service.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,The food was okay but horrible for the price of it. It was to expensive for what was given to us although the service was good. The restaurant was also really small and it was uncomfortable.
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,"Good diner food and friendly service. It's a good spot to get a bite, and I would definitely go back."
Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Good service and breakfast was delicious. My veggie omelette was perfect and country style potatoes were delicious.

Darren's Café,2731 Taylor St,Very popular. Probably better than most places in the area but not too great food quality. Staff are nice although service can be slow due to the amount of business they get.
