The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"The coffee here is outstanding, but the breakfast sandwich was extremely underwhelming. Barely any sauce or toppings, they also didn’t have any hot sauce. I’d personally skip that and stick to the drinks which are awesome. Didn’t try the pastries but I’m sure they are better. Only had outdoor seating, but it was still a vibe when sunny."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"The vibes here are so good. Food is amazing, coffee is great. It is a little slow sometimes but the Richfield is for people who take live life easy and well."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,neighborhood gem! delicious coffee (try the spaniard with condensed milk) and now they are upping their pastry game too. everyone who works there is kind and helpful.
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Stumbled upon this little gem while I was running errands. Service was quick. They even tried asked how my name is spelled to write my name on the cup. There was a water bowl for dogs and a bucket of chalk for kids or kids at heart.
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Tiny coffee shop with 3 small tables that can seat 2ppl each on the inside and maybe 5 small tables on the outside that can seat 2 ppl on the outside. The coffees are solid and yummy though all are the size of a Starbucks small. You can only get one size. I haven't yet tried the food. As long as you know what you're walking into, you won't be disappointed."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Tiny gem of a coffee shop, just a block or two away from Clement Street in the Inner Richmond. The interior is well designed and theme with boxing memorabilia and the exterior has plenty of cute tables to enjoy a nice brew. One of my favorite places to stop before going into work 🤓 …"
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Love this place. Coffee is so good, and they have coffee ice cubes. They have a good breakfast sandwich and yummy pastries and also a variety of other food that they rotate as they try new things. Constant innovation! Also everyone who works there is chill and nice"
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Cozy space, excellent coffee, and really nice staff. The building is cute place wedged between two roads, so it can be easy to miss. Definitely one of the better coffee shops in the Richmond."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"I wanted to like this place, but something was just missing.  Ordered:  Cold Brew - I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the barista put in coffee ice cubes instead of the #basic water cubes im my cup prior to filling it with that black gold. I was excited to be given that extra ounce of caffiene without my cold brew being dilluted. It was only after a few sips I began to realize that the ice had given my coffee that freezer taste..that old ice taste. Ugh. I think they have a promising concept, but the execution of protecting the ice has to be worked out.  Bacon & cheese muffin - It was ok. Wasn't given an option to heat it up, but maybe it would have tasted better then? It had a good amount of bacon bits, but didn't have much of a cheesy taste.  All in all it was ok. I wouldn't say there'd be anything to keep me going back."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"This guy used to have the best pastries and  a drink on the Too Good To Go App, way better quality and amount versus what I was getting at Cumaica and Peet's Coffee.  Unfortunately I haven't seen them on the app lately and I'm too broke to buy this deliciousness at regular price."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Cappuccino- consistently delicious Staff- incredibly friendly Avocado toast- not worth it  Highly recommend this place for good coffee and friendly staff. It’s a tiny shop and the only seating right now is outdoors. As for food I’ve only had the plain avocado toast which I don’t think is worth $7.50. Maybe if the bread was better and it had a few more toppings. Maybe other food items are good there though.
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Had Hot Chocolate- no cream. Got cream whipped in, and not piping hot. Meh. The Cafe au lait was better. Overall, not a knockout."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,They have the most Wonderful Coffee. Very Nice Staff. Its always clean . I come from northbeach just to have there coffee and there Goodmorning Hello. If I lived closer I'd come ever day. Starting your day with a smile and great cup of coffee makes for a good day. If you want a pour over or breakfast allow a little extra time. Its a small place and just 2 people. everything is made fresh. Thank you for being there. hope all you are well through this crazy time. cheers
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Super cute neighborhood coffee spot! We had delicious breakfast sandwiches and cold brew. Great vibes all around
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Good coffee, nice scone, good service (nice people).."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Cute little coffee shop, great tasting coffee comparable to Ritual, Equator & Blue Bottle! Glad I found this little gem!"
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"My friend loves this place, last time we came by they were closed. We tried again and they were open!  It was a bit chilly in the Richmond today so I thought it was a perfect time for hot chocolate (I don't drink coffee).  I didn't taste any chocolate in my hot chocolate. It tasted like warm water. Very disappointing.  Had to toss it and buy another one else where.  Not a good first experience but I'll give them another try when in the area."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Even if it was just a little neighborhood coffee spot with nothing more than their amazing beverage selection and some generic muffins, the charming ambiance, tasty coffee, and friendly service would still probably earn it five stars in my book. But what takes The Richfield above and beyond is their unique and delicious food menu. I was obsessed with the black sesame ricotta toast topped with fresh strawberries and coconut. I've never seen this combo anywhere else but as soon as I spotted it on the menu it was a where-have-you-been-all-my-life type of moment!  Though it's teeny with just a few small tables, it's a great addition to this neighborhood and I'm jealous of people who live in the area and can stop by on the regular. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to SF!"
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Perfect neighborhood cafe. Super friendly service, and the the coffee, baked goods, and breakfast sandwiches are all amazing."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"A great addition to the Inner Richmond when they opened in the early fall last year. The beans are their very own Snowbird brand. The friendly team pulls excellent espressos and makes some fine specialty drinks (the Brevano is my favorite treat). The food menu, while short, is tasty without a miss in the bunch. They've done a nice job sprucing up this funny space, making it a real neighborhood gem."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"This is the place where locals go grab a cup of coffee and hang out on Saturday mornings.) super small and cute inside, patio setting under maple trees outside."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Excellent seafood on Half Moon Bay. Always a long wait but we'll worth it.. Sit outside and watch the whales breach the water and put on a display. It's usually hot so take a hat, wear your sunblock, and have sunglasses. Oh yeah, they have a great bar too!"
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Great coffee - the cafecito is delicious!!  Big drawback: drinks are super slow to come out, esp during a work week! We've had to walk away a couple of times now from a line that moves too slowly."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Wonderful small coffee shop in the inner Richmond that also serves pastries and sandwiches. The chai latte is especially delicious. Grab a coffee, croissant, and a seat outside on a Saturday morning to start your weekend off right!"
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Nice little coffee shop offering creative drinks and a small menu of good eats
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Wonderful friendly coffee shop. It’s the neighborhood favorite for my house. Coffee ice cubes in the cold brew are a nice touch.
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Tiny coffee shop that takes the entire side of a tiny building. The cafe an adorable feel to it. The Richfield also makes great coffee. If you're hungry they also serve small food items like their popular avacado toast. Great spot to spend a lazy sunday morning.
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Good coffee, and the black sesame ricotta toast is incredible. Closed Monday and is on the small side, so can get crowded/backed up during busy hours."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Great neighborhood find!  The lattes are beautiful, the service spot on.  It's well run for the extremely small kitchen they have.  Great for a Sunday morning spot to read the paper."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Superb coffee and friendly staff, high prices.  A get what you pay for place, assuming you like fancy coffee.  They have phone chargers to lend to customers."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"I’m kind of obsessed with this spot, one of the smallest coffee shops imaginable. Get there early to get a seat inside or else they’ll already all be taken! Not always guaranteed that you can expect to stay there a while so just be prepared."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,"Super slow. Matcha latte came out lukewarm, was in the middle of some work, so my fault--I didn't take it back straight away. Asked for a remake 5mins later, got flak that I had drank part of it (duh?), and they refused to remake a 6oz $4.75 latte. After much discomfort and disruption to everyone, they offered a refund. So problem solved I guess? Seems pretty stupid that they didn't just remake the drink and keep the money. Stupid people."
The Richfield,195 5th Ave,Excellent pour over coffee at The Richfield. We also loved the classic bacon egg and cheese sandwich and the avocado toast. Such a great addition to the neighborhood!
