Starbucks,3595 California St,"I really love this Laurel Village Starbucks location. The customer service is very nice, quick support. I usually order online through Starbucks application, so I don’t have to wait in line. They have opened and space seating indoor. Free wifi. The bathroom is always maintained."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Packed almost all day long and only one outlet for customers that's always being used by cafe campers, Internet gets throttled at this location regularly throughout the day.  The only good things about this Starbucks are that they're open later than most and the staff are usually friendly.  Better as a grab & go.  I would avoid if you have any other close by options available for your coffee & you want a more casual and comfortable experience overall."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"There's no vegan food, the coffee is bitter and not drinkable, the service isn't stellar because the gen xer's are more interested in thumbing their phones than giving good service, the atmosphere contains homeless and thieves at any given time. The açai drinks are the only reason I go there."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"The staff hated the store being 24 hours because they were too lazy to clean up. Because of that, the store is restricted. No longer 24 hours No outlets (they hated labtop studying) No free parking (Lot 90min actively enforced, ticketed) why bother when door dings are common here. Street parking was free but now need a permit or 2 hours and this extends at a 12 block perimeter.  1 star for restricting the experience and making it un-enjoyable for others."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I don’t know what is the problem with “June” today, that rude attitude when she took my order was unacceptable. Super aggressive, I was still thinking and saying how I want my latte to be made and she kept asking “anything else to get for you today” for like 10 times.  What can I get for you today? Toffee nut latte please anything else to get for you today Extra espresso please anything else to get for you today 2 pumps of syrup only please anything else to get for you today Whipped cream on top please anything else to get for you today  I was very annoyed at the end, thank you. Other staffs are great. Won’t ever go in when June is working"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This store was filthy! Dirty sticky tables, windows dirty on the inside, floors had spilled drinks. A wall vent above the food was so dirty. Lots of staff behind the counter. At the very least manager should have someone wiping down tables once an hour. Not too much to ask since Starbucks charges $6 - $7 for a coffee drink. No excuse for a dirty store."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Starbucks- Laurel Village! I am glad with new decor. The bathroom needed hooks to place purse/coat vs the floor, air purifier and a garbage can. Plan to return, the staff is accommodating, pleasant."
Starbucks,3595 California St,I really enjoy this Starbucks location for the customer service and demographics. The indoor seating is very open and spaced for safety. The bathroom is always maintained and the condiments are always stocked. I have consistently enjoyed this location for more than 5 years. I recommend a  visit.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Used to love coming here at night to study but they removed the outlets everywhere. Kind of a bummer cuz no where else stays open past when I get off work so I can study ☹️ Also, would love more seating!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Why  this Starbucks? Try an employee creation called ""The Mint Chocolate Cold Brew"" only available at this location. It's also open 24 hours and the place is very clean during the day and at nighttime.CHEERS!!! I give this place 5 out of 5 stars for their overall rating. As usual the Starbucks music picks are playing. There is a continuos flow of customers, but yet a quiet and pleasant place to be especially for ""all nighters""."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"The good point is the store operates 24 hours and it has a lot of seating area, the disappointing points are dirty espresso hooper and poor customer service at register ( the black Americans women barista was mean !)"
Starbucks,3595 California St,This was one of the dirtiest Starbucks I've ever visited. The floor was littered with paper and spilled liquid and the tables were filthy. Usually my experiences with Starbucks have been positive but this location was terrible and not well maintained at all.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Open 24 hours, enough said. Good hot chocolate. Public restroom. Limited street parking. Highly recommended."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Stopped by to get a quick cup of Flat White, it was the middle of the week, line was short, mobile order which I placed, was done quickly, so no complaints. Plenty of sitting places, there is another entrance from the back ( parking I guess), also they have bathrooms and in general this Starbucks was pretty clean and OK to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee (which I didn't, because gotta go)."
Starbucks,3595 California St,The dinning area use to be 24 hours. And was the best spot to do work anytime. I first notice the upgrade to the restrooms. They look great now.  Unfortunately they decided to take away all outlets. Which is why I gave the 1 star.  Please bring back the outlets.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"They call this the Laurel Village Starbucks. It may be the only 24-hour Starbucks in the area. It is always busy, and is quite big with lots of seating inside. There is always a line, so don't do it if your bus is coming in less than 10 minutes."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I just was reviewing a different cafe, and afterwards Google asked if I'd like to review this Starbucks. I had just been thinking ""when you gotta put 'I'd rather have gone to Starbucks' in the review..."" (I didn't, it wasn't that bad). But let me tell you that is a criticism on culture not performance or range of services, because I go to Starbucks regularly and have never been disappointed. Try the espresso. Oh and when I uploaded the photo (I didn't really think I had a sb photo in my library that I would find, I just looked for s&gigs) I remembered that I wasn't a huge fan of the pumpkin scones cuz...they don't have creme cheese frosting! It's just regular sugar frosting like some sort of orange Christmas scone. Obviously there are plenty of ppl who like those because there was even a sign showing sb was glad to have these things back on the shelf. I am just voicing my opinion. If you're still here, maybe you'd like my blog. js.  °UPDATE(only minutes later)° I thought this was the Starbucks across the street from the Transamerica pyramid, which is the one I frequent. But this review is still relevant, so I will let it lie."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Popular hangout spot in Laurel Village. They recently had a remodel which has completely brightened up the place (it used to be so dark with the odd shelving and walls!), and had made it feel more spacious. Tables are always clean, and the crew here are so friendly!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Had a great time with friends and family at this Starbucks! They have a great staff and the location is great! Thank you guys!
Starbucks,3595 California St,Wonderful customer service. Got our usual venti lattes
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Standard Starbucks location. Good service, tasty food and steep prices like most other Starbucks locations. This place is almost always crowded during the day and I've  never seen it customer-free, even at 10PM."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Best Starbucks in the city! I go there basically every day. Service is always fast even when it’s crowded (which is often), place is always clean and staff always friendly. They’ll promptly fix anything that might be wrong with your order, though that hasn’t happened nearly as many times as it has at other Starbucks. Keith is the sweetest and his happy nature always brightens up my day."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"The place is open 24 hrs... which is awesome. Perfect place to go to work on essays and late night work. The staff were really nice, and the place felt like a local coffee shop, not a corporate Starbucks (the workers knew the regulars and would joke around all night with them). About 1 am it starts to clear out and there are less people around. Will definitely go back in the future for late night projects."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Zero customer service. I wanted to use the restroom and it was 6mins after their employees made up rule that restrooms close 30mins before closing, am I in equinox paying 200 dollars a month or a stupid Starbucks. I mean who set these rules but bunch of lazy employees. A tall guy resisted to be flexible on Sunday evening. You specially get zero star bro, congrats  lol"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Best employees ever.  I have been a very old customer since this place was opened for the public. I have always had received same high quality service. Employees have come and go but the same high standards are the same.
Starbucks,3595 California St,Last Starbucks in San Francisco that had wall outlets to charge ur laptop and study 📖 and they took them off
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Best Starbucks I've ever been to. Bathroom is on par with five star hotels, Barista is incredibly professional and knowledgeable as well as friendly to the perfect degree. Selection of coffee and beans is amazing. I ordered a Blue Mountain but someone happened to have bought the rest of the stock yesterday. The refund process was beautifully professional and efficient. After being used to the unpleasant experience at most of the Starbucks stores I've been to in the last a few years, this is the only store that's given me a 10/10 experience. Thank you."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This must be a workhorse for Starbucks. Parking available all along a big street and open 24/7. I have been here all different times of night and days of week and its busy in activity without a line over 2 people. The crew are always bringing their best attitude and workmanship to a demanding , diverse set of customers."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Very disorganized.Burnt espresso,missing order/s. 👎avoid! …"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Don't know the morning staff, but the evening/late night staff seem to be doing a good job keeping this place more organized and functional than most Starbucks I've been to. Not to mention that it's open all night, let's people sit, and doesn't cover up the outlets. This may not sound like a big deal in other more civilized cities,  but this is SF so you do the math. I'm impressed."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"It's always packed in here. Many of the seats are occupied by the homeless. There was a nasty smell that was probably brought by the homeless, and it is pretty damn strong. I'm smell-sensitive and that stink was hard to tolerate. Some homeless used more than one seat for their luggage and stuff."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Came in just before close and got my usual hazelnut latte, ordered a scone as I was pretty hungry and they noted they were out but the barrista was super nice and gave me the display one for free!  Great service!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Clean and fast. You have to love a place that knows your order as walk in the door. As you walk up you can see its laptop city, during the fall its a second study hall, with a mix of writers, musicians and photographers. The staff does a great job of keeping the place clean and service is always fast."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"The day staff is extremely rude! This place is opened 24 hours, but in the process of shutting down at night due to residents complaining about the riffraff the place attracts. Also, too many Police officers stop by to get their coffee there. This contributes to make you feel even more unsafe in this establishment.  Definitely a place to avoid at any time of the day or night if you want to stay safe. Also, their drinks are watered down and cost too much. Everything is over priced in that awful place."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Trash everywhere. Sat here all day and no one comes around to clean up.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Love that they are open 24 hours and have lots of seating, but man their bathrooms leave a lot to be desired. Forever out of supplies and often times water or some other fluids on the floor. Not sure if the toilet leaks or what, but it's really bad. You cannot count on a clean restroom at this location."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"One of the few 24 hour Starbucks  There had been a problem here with homeless people sleeping in the comfy seats, which is not good for SB and not good for real customers. Unfortunately that forced SB to reduce the comfort and quantity of seating. In the late evening the place fills up with cops going on or off duty, but they don't stay long and it's just a rush worth being aware of.  Other than that it's a Starbucks. Just like all the rest."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I used to frequent this Starbucks location, since for most of my life, this was a 24hrs/7 days a week Starbucks. Now, they have changed the hours and are not open 24hrs every day, which just sucks so much because there are no other options anymore for coffee or tea late night, unless you want to drive all the way to Daly City, which is quite the drive for a cup of something hot to drink. Aside from the sudden change in hours, I have to say I'm extremely disappointed in the AWFUL customer service here these days, especially at night time. I am never ever greeted and always have to deal with a really crappy attitude. Literally, the last 10-15 times I've been here it's always been the same night crew and I am so sick of the way they treat their customers. They make me feel as though I'm an inconvenience to them, like I'm bothering them when I order something, and like it is SUCH a huge burden on them that I am even talking to them. They constantly seem absolutely pitiful when serving the customers and I really don't appreciate how horribly I'm treated each time I go there. Aside from all of this, they don't even bother to clean the bathrooms at night and it is absolutely disgusting. I wish they would step up their game at this location because it is just so disappointing what has happened to this location, that I used to visit DAILY for 10+ years. Now I don't bother ever going in there because I can't stand the rude workers."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"As a student, this place is perfect to come do homework if you show up way too early for your clinical rotation (because it's a 24hr Starbucks). This is really nice to just walk to and catch up with friends as well, and the neighborhood is very nice too! It gets crowded during the day because of the 2 hospitals that are nearby, but nonetheless, I've found that this is one of the better Starbucks in the city."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I just moved closer to this location so I go to this Starbucks, now.  Haven't had any problems with the baristas or service, so far :-).  So glad we have a starbucks in the laurel heights area!! I hope this all ends and we can sit in the store again.  One of my joys in life is sipping on a hot coffee in a coffee shop.  Thank you and keep up the good work, guys!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"clean, well functioning.  *edit.   after further review, and making my face known regularly, my experience here has improved to everything i want in a starbucks. There is often a line but it moves fast.  large seating areas spread into 3 regions, allows you to move away from say a noisy table to completely quiet ""region.""   good amount of outlets but not everywhere which gives space for both turn and burn customers and those who need more time or a refill.  i like this location."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This is the only 24 hour Starbucks of which I am aware.  As a night owl, I'm always glad to visit at 3:30 AM.  It's spacious and I have found the staff to be consistently friendly.  As for the food and drinks, it's pretty much standard Starbucks fare.  A nice little nighttime oasis...."
Starbucks,3595 California St,The listings for this site say that it's open 24 hours. I'm having a late night and I just drove 10 minutes across town in San Francisco at 3 a.m. to find out that they're actually closed every Monday from 1 to 4 for deep cleaning. I'm really kind of pissed off because I could have driven all number of other directions at 3 in the morning if the map and or the information they gave you wasn't an error. This sucks.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Oh God! The Late night staff here is amazing, Dominique guy with brown hair and the dark lady with beautiful afro hairstyle do a great job: I am studying here but their dynamic is amazing. They help eachother and run errands. I have seen hardworking people- but I have not seen people who make it seem so easy. They are so skilled. Great welcoming skills. Also, the spot to study. <3 :)"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This starbucks would have been great if it was actually open 24/7 like advertised on google. Also i had found a nice cozy spot by the window only to be kick out so they can sweep and mop 3-4 hours BEFORE closing. And after I moved I got kicked out AGAIN so they can sweep and clean another section. Very annoying why not wait until you actually close??? apparently they close at midnight?? Update your hours online so they are accurate please, I hate coming to a place only to be mislead!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Although this Starbucks here on California Street in San Francisco is one of the busiest in the town, you always get great service and they always get your order right. Good place to people watch too."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I really love this Starbucks, it's a big one with a lot of seats but often busy. Friendly staff and open 24/7. One downside is that if you stay for more than an hour, you can smell the coffee on your clothes unlike most coffee places."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"The baristas are uniformly friendly, efficient, and engaging. Open 24 hours, the staff is on point even at 3 a.m. Food and drink are Starbucks standards (IMO not the best out there but also not the worst), and always well-made by this staff."
Starbucks,3595 California St,It's open early if not a true 24 its close enough if your in the area & need a fairly quick cup of coffee & a bite at 3 or 4 am has you wait on a bus or b4 /after work or got a few mins break and want a cheap grab bag because ain't nothing open to speak of..it's your place. Big & roomy largest Starbucks stand alone in the city i know of
Starbucks,3595 California St,The space is big for Starbucks but the little ones behind the counter must spend a lot of time on their devices.  Hard to communicate with the young guy and gal that were working there at 10 pm tonight.  Don't see them with their phones but *disconnect* with them is like with many Millennial service employees.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Customer feel the rush to order,  Lactose milk not part of menu. Every addition cost extra on top of the costly prices.  Not fair for our low income community .. We are sustaining  Starbucks expenses by purchasing of half what we like because they don't have it"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Laurel Village. Nicely done interior remodel. Several benches in front to enjoy the sun with your drink. It's my go-to Starbucks.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Great place for grabbing Starbucks, especially if you need a good reading or study spot. Lots of tables and comfortable seating, and lots of parking out back. Lots of outlets and people seem generally comfortable. Music is at a decent volume."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Good service and coffee at this location
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Constantly posting my order is ready for pick up even though it is not .. I wouldn't care other then for the fact that I put in my order 20 min before I come by. If I knew the order would not be ready, the order wouldn't have been placed . Their lack of communication is causing me to run late for work. Will have to change locations."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Nice Starbucks outlet. The staff were super friendly and helpful. There are many different seating areas with varying vibes (e.g. comfortable chairs for chatting, seats by a window counter suitable for working on your laptop etc)."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Bathrooms were in need of immediate attention, no soap, filthy and employees seem indifferent when I told them and just stand there doing nothing.  Very rude service also."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Great staff and clean building. In a nice location and is open later than any other Starbucks in SF at the time of writing!
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Open 24 hours. It's a large Starbucks almost always filled with people reading/studying.  Few study places are open late in SF, so this place is very valuable. Most baristas are nice and friendly.  Now the bad thing... I have my messenger bag and laptop stolen at this place when I was ordering during the busy hours, store almost full.  There are always quite a few laptop campers in this store, but that doesn't mean this place is free of thieves.  And unfortunately no security camera seems to be installed on the side leading to the bathroom, where many outlets and therefore laptop campers are.  Just be aware."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I have always been true to Peets but$ has given me a great appreciation of Starbucks; milder blends & less expensive. Good way to start your day. Nice staff, great banana bread!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Nothing wrong with this location! It's large, spacious, and quiet in the wee hours with a few workers, students and fellow insomniacs doing their own thing. And they seem to have sorted out the problem from the last post."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I've been coming here for moths now. Wounda the night manager, is to busy holding Court with her followers to great you or to take your order. You have to wait for them to finish their conversation. It's obvious she thinks highly of her self. Homeless hang around, wealthy patrons and ghetto Baristas are not a good mix."
Starbucks,3595 California St,This is my favorite Starbucks in the city. Mostly a college crowd. Nice atmosphere. Usually a very clean store. Friendly service. A roomy place. Check it out. It's open 24/7/365 too.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This is one of the only starbucks that I know that is open 24 hours! I used to spend a lot of time in this area, and it was really convenient to be able to get a fresh cup of coffee at any time of the night. The baristas here are some of the best I have seen. At the early hours in the morning, they could see their regular customers approaching from the hill nearby, and they would get their drinks started for them-before they even entered the building. You'll see a combination of police officers, students, and families here."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Great coffee. Pricey
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Typical Starbucks very chill, near Lombard. Very warm and welcoming inside. Most of the city is pretty anti bathroom use but this Starbucks was very cool and the coffee was made fresh"
Starbucks,3595 California St,I come here for my daily morning cup. Place can get really busy but staff are friendly. I love that my mobile order is ready almost every time so I don't have to wait long.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I was rushed in ordering, and the restaurant itself was cluttered with millenials every which way. I was mistreated, assumingly due to my age, and could not eat in the shop due to the millenials in the way. I don't drink coffee, but their Very Berry Hibiscus Lemonade Starbucks Refreshers Iced Beverage was not particularly enjoyable."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Okay this is more to the management than the staff.   Each time I come to this place there out of something they never seem to have everything you want in stock.  Staff is great they just need better leadership
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Wanda closed the door at 1 AM Monday and told me it would not open up until 4 AM Monday and when I asked her through the door why they were closed she told me I was threatening her because I was having to yell through a door, she did let me in but continued to yell at me the entire time. I explained I had called one half hour earlier and no one answered the phone, she told me she wouldn't answer the phone because she received prank phone calls. Not a very good representative for Starbucks"
Starbucks,3595 California St,I ordered a beagle with butter cause they were out of whipped cream and then these cowards forgot to put it on the bagel or even give me some butter evening is ruined best regards yarro
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I posted a picture on ""add a photo"". There are two trash holes right where you dress your coffee and a canister right beside it for recycle and compost. All four openings were overflowing and left like that for the two hours that I sat in the lobby. Everything else was fine but that right there deserves one star bc I have never seen this before at a starbucks and it is completely unacceptable. Disgusting."
Starbucks,3595 California St,I'm a Starbucks junky. This one on California at the Laurel Heights Village is super crowded. Managed to snag a comfy leather chair to sip my latte. Used the mobile app ordering system to avoid the crazy long line and it worked beautifully.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"1st THING TO KNOW: 1. Just because there is a parking lot, it doesn't mean you're free of time limits! There is a **90 MINUTE** parking limit and they're on top of it! (I got a ticket). It's SF...so expect it basically everywhere.  LOCATION: 1. Very Spacious and different kinds of seatings/ tables (normal, tall, etc...) 2. Loud music, and they were playing Taylor Swift for an hour straight or more (a bit annoying after the 10th song) 3. A great place if you listen to your own music 4. aesthetically pleasing"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Never been treated rudely at any Starbucks but Wanda made that happen for me, kinda wondering if she put milk in my coffee now too because she was rude about me asking if there was milk or almond milk, why do you have her on register? Oh well I'll just throw this coffee away."
Starbucks,3595 California St,I Love Starbucks!‼ the sweetest people work there. Sooo friendly‼ mango dragonfruit refresher is my drink of choice
Starbucks,3595 California St,My local neighborhood Starbucks where Wanda's chipper personality and the smiles of the baristas makes it a good stop every time. LOVE THIS STORE!!
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I love this Starbucks. You can tell the workers enjoy what they do. They work good under pressure when it gets busy, even if they do get overwhelmed, they keep a smile on their faces!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"It's a good place to bring some work and a laptop,. Most people here are posted up using wifi and studying or working in small groups.  It's open 24! Also a favorite rest stop for SFPD. Id give it 5 stars , but to me,  the food options at Starbucks are glaringly lame,  and it's so obvious how to beef they're offering up (pun)  and yet they don't.  You know how much money id drop in Starbucks if they had better food which could approximate a deli meal or even an airplane snack?  Man cannot live by pastry alone,  though man try.."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Although I usually don’t get starbucks coffee, I stopped by today. Good reviews because they have really nice people working at this location. Sad that I cant say the same for other starbucks nationwide."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Saturday evening 8~10pm, quite some people here and their internet sucks BALLS. Keeps appearing and disappearing from the list of discoverable networks and when finally connected is so slow you can't even open the Google main page. The second star is for the barista that sat down with me trying to help me connect."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Open 24hrs making it very convenient if you're having a late night. Always packed with people. Usually get the single brew using their clover machine.
Starbucks,3595 California St,This is the biggest I have been to. Easy access to the (small) bathroom. Not the fastest staff but plenty of seats. Don't be surprised to see SFPD in here later in the evening.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"I hand my cup to a dreaded haired woman for a refill and she grabs it by the TOP RIM of the cup.....in between HANDLING MONEY. Completely disgusting to even the dirtiest gutter punk ! Just happened 20 minutes ago,  Thursday,  August 24th .... Shady & with a hint of racism in my perception , seeing the two of us have never laid eyes on each other , ever... A river rat would shutter... Trump himself would gasp..."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"A Starbucks is good because it can be trusted to be a Starbucks.  This one goes above and beyond an average Starbucks in these outstanding achievements of it's team and the local police force: ·Open 24/7 ·In the spirit of San Francisco: caters to all of its many diverse elements and provides a safe environment ·Power, Wi-Fi, Starbucks services ·SFPD on duty outside ·Courteous and helpful team inside ·Clean and pleasant  Thank you for providing a safe environment for dislocated workers!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,The hours are wrong. They close at 9 pm.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Good Starbucks in a convenient location, especially if you're walking. Service was fast and friendly. Coffee was good. Good covid-19 compliance."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Good place to study, come in out of the rain, pretty cool people hang out here.."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Why is there only 1 person making coffee with a constant line up? It took her 3 tries to get my iced coffee right. Add another barista, maybe the drinks will come out right first time if theyre not rushing."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Hard working crews making the most of a challenging location. They handle tons of customers very professionally while kinda functioning as babysitters for students, neighborhood types and struggling people utilizing it as a waystation."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"What happened recently in Philadelphia made me think about what I have experienced in this store. Some of Starbucks employees really need training. I asked for a cup of water when I was waiting for my beverage, the tall white hair caucasian women in her late 40th told me “ask from cashier next time”, so I thought she is going to offer me this time, instead, I waited for about 10 minutes, nothing happened. But I saw she offered water to some other caucasian female customers. I finally has to line up again and purchased a bottle of water. This is San Francisco, probably the most diversified city in US, unfortunately race discrimination is inside people's heart."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"The baristas are there to be of assistance and to help the customers have a great experience going there. I ordered online for an Iced Green Tea Latte, and I was unsatisfied with the way it was made. I asked to have more matcha powder in it but one barista told me put more next time beforehand, it was as if they were bothered that I asked to add more to my drink. I thought the policy is that ""IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH YOUR ORDER WE WILL MAKE A NEW ONE"". Are the baristas not following this anymore?  Then on a separate day, I ordered in store for the same thing but wanted a certain amount of Matcha powder in my drink. The cashier said it was too much. I was not asking for a drink that was exaggerated, i.e. one pump this, two pumps this, 3 shots of this, a dash of this, stir in the milk, no foam, no whip, no vanilla, but add chocolate to my latte.  All I was asking was to make my drink to a consistency or the taste that I wanted."
Starbucks,3595 California St,I drop in every morning ony way to office. They always are so friendly and fast! Barista made an excellent tea choice! I will be back to this location.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Giving this starbucks 5-stars because it's just like any other starbucks except that it's open 24-hours. I also appreciated that the people behind the counter seemed to have a relationship with the patrons, making it feel more like a community spot"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Great place and has lots of sitting room. They are open 24 hours, which is a HUGE Plus. The Free WiFi work well most of the time."
Starbucks,3595 California St,My favorite coffeeshop near home!! Cool staff and you meet great people over there. My drink were on point! This location impressed me.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"One of only two 24 hr Starbucks in the entirety of San Francisco. It's super busy but I like that I can usually get dark roast at 3am. Lotsa students from nearby University of San Francisco cramming here, Uber/Lyft drivers taking breaks, officers from the Park Service and SFPD satisfying their caffeine requirements all night long. I'm a night owl so this place is a godsend to me."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Always clean when Kayla is there; lovely attention to customers that makes you come back every day. Great job guys
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Not much to say. It's not a bad Starbucks, and the fact that it's 24 hours is the only thing that brings me in. Been quite a few times and I always feel rushed when I order, and they never get my order right."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"HeadquarThis place is two faced ! My rating of 5 stars means they did a great job of making feel so uncomfortable , unwanted & unwelcome ! I tell everyone I meet not to go ! The ones who decide to go check it out ! Say to me ! Dam you were right ! Why didn't I listen to you ! My friend Don who is handicapped and in a wheelchair  ! Was told he had to leave the store because he was there more then Jennifer the manager ! How ever he was welcome to come by any time and spend his fixed income ! How ever he had to leave after he made his purchase and keep it moving ! The corporate headquarters is investigating"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Open 24 Hours but some days it closes 12 AM and Google working hours information is wrong also a lot of homeless strolling here. Employee is good
Starbucks,3595 California St,The bathroom is completely dirty;it smells like pee.I wouldn't want to go there again to wash my hands and/or pee again. I can believe they don't clean it when needed. :(
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Of the couple of times I've been here, there servers/baristas seem angry and not very friendly. In a way, I don't think it is their fault because they seem always under staffed."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Keila the manager at this Starbucks was the worse Experience I ever had at any starbursts Be careful if u don’t wan to have the worse brake fast Monday at 4.30 am Go any otter starbursts Have a great day everyone hope this “manager “ Learn about customer service is important especially earlier morning
Starbucks,3595 California St,I am in love with their iced coffee! i always get the iced caramel macchiato and its always made just the way I like it! They make sure I have my extra caramel in my coffee!
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Hours are wrong, and no one cares to change them. Expect them to be closed, go somewhere else."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Coffee was the worst coffee I have ever tasted and customer service was not in the slightest bit friendly. Not just a one time thing, went there three times and coffee tasted old and very bitter, would not recommend this place to anyone☕💀🤢😡 …"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Lots of seating and only closes once a week. If it weren't for the restroom floor always being wet I'd give it 5 stars.
Starbucks,3595 California St,Open 24hrs. Fantastic and plentiful seating and parking options for reading or working. Pretty much the best you could ask for in a city Starbucks.
Starbucks,3595 California St,Open 24 hrs except closes at 1:00 am - 4:00 am Sunday night/ Monday morning. Parking right in front - meters. More food choices than most. More seating than most SB.
Starbucks,3595 California St,Maybe the best Starbucks in SF coffee-wise. Average unfriendly Laurel Village clientele leaves something to be desired. Service is really good though.
Starbucks,3595 California St,Coffee not like PEETS! I hate I stand in line and people walking in picking up their phone orders and we are waiting for someone to wait on us. It's ok if PEETS is closed.
Starbucks,3595 California St,My favorite Starbucks. Had the first rude cashier tonight but still deserves 5 stars for convenience. And the barista was very nice.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"It's a Starbucks, you know the deal. This particular one recently underwent a renovation, though looks about the same as pre-renovation. From an ""I want to study at a Starbucks"" perspective, this one almost always seems full, so, go early?"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Filthy bathrooms That smell of urine. Managers That mistreat thier crew members with verbal abuse. Managers that do very little managing or work for that matter. Managers that pick on old ladies who are homeless.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Very quick an efficient crew didnt wait long an was in a hurry but didnt feel any pressure , got in got out excellent Mocha as well cant ask for more"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Nice place to get together with friends. This Starbucks has a great atmosphere. Their coffee is fabulous.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Bad phone service. This lady and her manager or something were really rude to me when I asked them a question. I wasn't even rude to them. Even though it may seem rash,  I would drive the extra mile to find another Starbucks just to avoid this one."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Got myself a hot chocolate and my dog a puppycchino! She was such a fan and the employees were very nice.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Good size facility that is open 24 hours!  On the downside, being open continuously it lacks cleanliness and definate overall upkeep!"
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Quite spacious location with seating areas suitable for work/study and good wifi. Usually easy parking, especially on weekends."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Unless you've been living in a cave, or are very young, you probably already know what Starbucks is all about.  What sets this location apart from the others is that it is open 24 hours a day. If you're craving that caffeine fix at 3 a.m. in the morning, they'll be here waiting."
Starbucks,3595 California St,What's the point of customizing a drink on the app if they are not going to create my specific order? Friendly people at take out window tho.
Starbucks,3595 California St,This location could not get my simple chai tea latte order right. First gave me a green tea latte and then a chai tea with a baggie?? I just wanted the regular chai tea latte. It’s not that hard
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Internet could be sooooo much better at this location (actually at all Starbucks locations in SF). Also, I wish they wouldn't blast the music so loud."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Your meeting place! The group table is great for leisure reflecting or reading. Healthy options are available. Peaceful ambiance!
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Got a traveler lack last night and the time I got ready to drink it the coffee was cold, supervisor said sorry about that  did not say can we get you another one or can we get you something else! Horrible customers service, where you find these workers?"
Starbucks,3595 California St,Wow no more outlets to charge my laptop 💻 then what’s the point of coming to Starbucks!
Starbucks,3595 California St,This is one of the busiest I've been to. I always have to wait for a long time to get my drink.
Starbucks,3595 California St,They've never messed up my order and are the only Starbucks that actually knows my name before I say it!
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Decently sized, modern-looking Starbucks store that is open late. Friendly service and good amount of seats and outlets."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Very nice staff, clean restroom, open 24/7. Easy parking at night."
Starbucks,3595 California St,The attention is very bad
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This is my local Starbucks. The staff are very friendly and efficient, and every visit has been a delight."
Starbucks,3595 California St,Good place but would be much better place to hang out if the music wasn't so loud that it sounds like a night club!
Starbucks,3595 California St,Dirty and worn...high traffic. The staff is the same worn and uninviting. Time for a good clean up.
Starbucks,3595 California St,The line can be long but just do like everyone else has figured out and place a mobile order.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"This location still has seating, unlike many that have reduced chairs and tables to minimize the number of people overstaying their welcome."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"It's Starbucks -- dependable, consistent coffee. After a recent trip to New Zealand, I now order mostly flat white."
Starbucks,3595 California St,It was alright. Not an empty seat in the house. Coffee was fresh. First time visiting. I was in the neighborhood🤓 …
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Pretty neat spot; it's a shame they rearranged the seatings by the window though, I thought it was much more cozy with opposing chairs.."
Starbucks,3595 California St,I love Starbucks but this Starbucks is exceptional. Great staff. Drinks are always accurate.
Starbucks,3595 California St,Day times and evenings are like heaven. But the late night shift's staff is like nightmare.
Starbucks,3595 California St,I love Starbucks is my most favorite place to go on a date and they pay you back for spending your money
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Glad it's a big place, it gets crowded. Good place to study, however the amount of outlets  are limited."

Starbucks,3595 California St,As all Starbucks a very good place  for coffee & snacks along with catching up on work free WI-FI
Starbucks,3595 California St,Typical Starbucks fare with friendly service. I like the fact that they're open 24 hrs.
Starbucks,3595 California St,"My favorite Starbucks anywhere,  lots of room, plenty of outlets, and 24 hours.   Awesome."
Starbucks,3595 California St,"Great service,  need to do smth about tge restroom.... very dirty and almost nonfunctional....other wise 5-*"
Starbucks,3595 California St,4 stars because it opens 24 hours.  Missing one star because it is always packed in the evenings and its difficult to get a seat.

Starbucks,3595 California St,They made my drink expertly. It kinda smells like pee in this place.
