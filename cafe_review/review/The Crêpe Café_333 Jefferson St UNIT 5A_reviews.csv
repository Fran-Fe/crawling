The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"We found this crepe place on our family trip to San Francisco, and it was amazing! They’ve got tons of different crepes and they all taste great. You could eat here for every meal, but the dessert crepes are the real stars.  The spot has indoor and outdoor seating, which was a nice touch. And it’s right in the wharf, so you can stop by while you’re sightseeing. Can’t recommend this place enough for anyone who loves good food. We’ll definitely be back next time we’re in town!"
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"Walking by a crepe cafe is something I rarely do without having walked inside first. If made right they are delicious, flavorful and wonderful to eat. Many are filled with an assortment of fruits with bananas and strawberries being the most popular. You’ll also find chocolate which, only enhances its overall flavor. Unfortunately, the only fruits available were bananas and strawberries. I can’t tell you the exact calorie count nor do I want to. Just know they’re delicious and a delight to eat. So, enjoy The Crepe Cafe while in San Francisco."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"The Crêpes were very delicious and there wasn't much of a line, though a few minutes later, it was long. There are many tables and a bar top too. I got the Strawberry Nutella crêpe and it was good. Highly recommend and there are one or two places to charge up."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,Gross. Worst crepes I’ve ever had. Crepe batter doesn’t have good flavor. Gave me rotten bananas. Even if the bananas were fresh it wouldn’t have tasted good. Coffee wasn’t good either.
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,Very american crepe cafe with both sweet and savory crepes ! The have a nice pation with outdoor seating on the backside . We tried the nutella crepe with cream and sugar - definitely coming back here again! The gourmet crepes will try next time- looked very good!
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"Honestly a really great breakfast and lunch place if you're staying at a hotel nearby! I actually got a bread bowl of chowder, which was completely delicious!! Crepes are good as well and a wide variety of coffee and tea options."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"Just ordered take-out from here and was astounded by the terrible customer service from the girl working the register.  First off the place opened 10 minutes late, not a big deal, but standing outside for 15 minutes with 2 hungry young kids and no apology set the tone.  Ordering with her turned almost hostile. No welcome, no smile, no thank you the whole time. I had to ask her to repeat the cheese 3 times as she went through the options so fast, which was met with a roll of the eyes the third time.  I mistakenly ordered the food dine-in as I did not mention I would like it to go, she then literally threw the to go boxes towards me and walked off.  I have never felt the urge to write a bad review, even through other bad customer service experiences, but this was too much.  If you do not like dealing with people, do not work in the service industry."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,Steak crepe and bread bowl is good but they burnt the coffee beans
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,Stopped in for little Crepes by the Fisherman's Warf.  It's a  cute space.  Ordered the strawberry banana and Nutella and it came out fast and was terrific.
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"Strawberry banana Nutella crepe was good but strawberries were not fresh . The breakfast special crepe- mushrooms too hard, was supposed to have sautéed spinach, but was undercooked chard- cheese was not melted, not cooked long enough. Maria was the cashier and when we came in - I said good morning, she picked up her drink- took a sip and initiated her RBF. She was very unfriendly and could use some training as a front person to your business"
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"So good we ate here 2 days in a row! Cafe latte and savory egg, spinach, tomato crepe was huge and great start to a day of sightseeing. My daughter loved the mixed fruit with whipped cream. Staff are friendly and service was prompt so we could eat and be on our way. Definitely recommend!"
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,For tourists. I asked for a Ketchup to go with my soggy fries. They told me that they need to charge me extra for that.
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"It’s nice, specially if you’re in for something sweet! The crepe was thicker than in a traditional French recipe and much sweeter too. It’s was overall a nice meal but nothing that it’s going to change your day, I’ve tried a simple cheese and ham one and because the batter was very sweet didn’t feel like the right combination there! I would definitely go for a chocolate one, as a nice dessert 😊"
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,Having been in San Francisco over the summer they were closed when I came so I had to stop in when I came back. Well that was a HUGE MISTAKE! I ordered the chicken they were out of crab 🤦🏾 and it had more onions than chicken and the clam chowder had nice chunks of clams and more rosemary than the law allows. So I trashed it all $30 just wasted and went and spent $20 at another restaurant.
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"So many crêpe options here; sweet or savory, take your pick. For my choice, the crab crêpe was definitely worth the price. Also offers ice cream cones and other baked things. Outdoor seating is through the back, and orders come out pretty quickly despite how busy the place might be."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"The crepe tasted and was firmly more like a tortilla. Very saddened in that this was not a crepe. The filling was good, hard to go wrong with chocolate, strawberries and bananas. They were offering bread bowls and a slew of other menu items, but for a place to be named after a crepe, my hopes were high and quickly dashed. Would not re immediately for crepes."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"Excellent crepes!!!! Clean restaurant, fun window at street side to watch them being made. My only complaint is I didn't the one I ordered.  It was to go so I didn't realize till I got to the hotel to eat it. It was still good."
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,An avocado veggie crepe was great and delicious. But mixed fruit one with strawberries and bananas had tainted bananas - very disappointing.
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,Crepes were delicious. The line was long so service was a little slow. The restaurant itself was super dirty. Most people were taking the crepes to go because none of the tables were cleaned off. Maybe 3 families were sitting down inside. The remaining tables were all empty and dirty waiting to be cleaned.
The Crêpe Café,333 Jefferson St UNIT 5A,"Other than opening 30 minutes late, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend this place! There are a wide variety of crepe flavors and waffles. The only reason I did not give it five starts is because it opened late and there were a lot of people waiting outside the door."
