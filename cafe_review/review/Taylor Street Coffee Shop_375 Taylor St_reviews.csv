Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Came here for an early morning breakfast and it was delicious! The service was super fast and was seated quickly. I do notice that after a while it did get really crowded since they got busier so I do recommend coming when they just open it. The area did feel unsafe as just on the same block was a lot of homeless people so do be careful. Try walking on a different road that is less crowded when trying to get here.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Phenomenal local cafe serving exquisite breakfast & lunch plates. The staff is extraordinarily efficient and accommodating!
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Extremely delicious breakfast.  Amazing bacon.  Sailor hash brown meal out of this world.  Pancakes from heaven!  Would come back again and again.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Pretty good little breakfast spot.  I ordered eggs o easy w pork sausage, home fries.  Food was good, OJ fresh and coffee too. No issues, seems pricey but i’m not an SF regular to compare."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Such a great place! I really enjoyed my scrambled eggs with chorizo and cherry peppers. The fruits were fresh, everything was delicious. Loved the atmosphere too"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Great small place to eat breakfast. Amazing customer service even better home feel food. Get there early fills up fast on the weekend.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Awesome breakfast in an itty bitty space.  The preparation and presentation are fine chef quality.  Despite appearances this is not your regular greasy spoon diner.  Millionaire Bacon proudly served.  My eggs Benedict were done to perfection.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Must try the millionaire bacon! Small interior with about 10 table so can get crowded. Food is better than most breakfast places around. The interior is slightly dated but very clean. The hash is good and the burgers are well prepared too. Only opens in the morning closes after lunch time.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"MILLIONAIRE BACON 🥓🥓🥓 A delicacy, although admittedly not for everyone - extra thick, somewhat spicy, and $10 for two slices. Other menu items are the real winners - burgers with sprouts, perfectly done over-easy eggs, or chunky seafood salad. This one's a special hole-in-the-wall."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"quaint little hidden cafe, squash between 2 buildings! the service and the food were great! the hash and millionaire's bacon are the stars of the place! great places to get some brunch before exploring the city."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"This place is a hole in the wall. Would have never noticed it if I hadn’t been looking for it. The food was excellent but the service was a bit slow. In fact, we saw a couple get up and leave their table just because they were waiting so long. However, we were in no rush so we were luckily able to enjoy the eggs benedict. The one with the millionaire’s bacon is the one I would recommend. Crab one was good but not nearly as tasty."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Taylor is my favorite place to each breakfast in San Francisco, USA 🇺🇸.  The place was very small and cozy and atmosphere was amazing it made me feel like home 🏠. The service was excellent and and staff are sweet and friendly. 🌺🙏🏼  The food was excellent with fresh ingredients 🤤. We went twice and every dish 🥄 was more yummy than the other. We ordered very berry salad 🥗, Spiffy Sandwich 🥪, Greek Omelette 🍳: the taste is earthy and vegetable aroma. The taste is so good.. try it with maple syrup. The maple syrup complements the feta 🤤 😋  Trust me, You won’t regret it! It’s the best in San Francisco 😍😍😍"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Is an small and warmest place to eat breakfast or lunch, the prices are affordable. The food was delicious 😋. Because it is small place you need to wait to sit. but it will be worth the wait. I forgot to take photos to the food. our empty plates speak for themselves. …"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"I'm a hole-in-the-wall junky, and this place made my heart so happy. Food was AMAZING, everything cooked flawlessly, turn over was quick. The only thing that was not that great was for a packed house, with a line out the door, there was only one server. She was trying, but was just totally overwhelmed. Still, would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to EVERYONE!"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"ORDERED FLORENTINE BENEDICT($17), CRUCH FLAKES FRENCH TOAST ($14) AND THE MILLIONAIRE BACON($10) ALL VERY TASTEY AND DELICIOUS. VERY FRESH, AND CAME OUT PRETTY QUICK. SUPER CUTE AND QUAINT PLACE. I WILL DEF STOP BY WHEN I AM IN TOWN NEXT AND INTRODUCE IT TO SOMEONE."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Popped in for breakfast while in town. Pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was. Would probably be a regular if I lived here.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Well done! This place is a very little and isle shaped diner style cafe. And their foods are fresh and tasty. Their kitchen is very limited but also they’re doing a nice job in that place. A kind of miraculous job for the kitchen side. The wait staff was so polite and nice also. Thanks to all!
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,The millionaire bacon is a must. Very tasty menu options like the loaded hash. The coffee is pretty good too.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Has bacon ever given you goosebumps when you eat it? THIS is the bacon that gave me goosebumps. It’s like $7.50 for the bacon, but it is worth every bite. Who knew you could make bacon better? Like I know they don’t really mix their bacon into anything because it’s that much of a delicious stand alone item, but WOW is this place worth it. This place has the freshest orange juice I have ever had in my life, the fruit side is huge, and the omelet is huge. I’m so happy I came here 😭😭😭💯"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"This place is great. I ordered the Sailors Hash, which is their take on hash loaded with yummy seafood: blue crab, shrimp, salmon, and bacon. Added a side of millionaire's bacon (sugar coated bacon fried until glazed and candied). My server was also super nice and attentive, making sure everything was good and that my coffee was filled. This is a very small restaurant that holds probably less than 25 people and at 10:30am on a Monday the line was out to the door. But don't let that dissuade you from coming here because the food is delicious and comforting. The Mom and Pop vibe is welcomed and I was very fortunate to stumble upon this little gem of a restaurant."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,This place is extraordinary! I’m staying next door at the Hilton and wandered across for breakfast based on it’s strong Google reviews. I had the Blackstone Benedict and it was as good as it gets. I arrived pretty much within 5 mins of opening and the place was half full. Within 10 mins there was a queue. Definitely worth the wait. I’ll be back every day.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,I love 💘 this litter dinner the food is so delicious.  The tailors hash is my favorite I will literally eat this every day. The bowl of fruits is a definite treat so sweet and fresh.  The staff members work really hard and they are polite. A definite stop if you are in San Francisco. …
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"I try to eat breakfast here when ever I'm in the city. Usually a line but I shoot for 7am, opening time, and sometimes get lucky and miss the line. Food is excellent!!! Serving size is perfect. It's rare I eat breakfast and have trouble deciding what to order.  It's small, the food servers move fast, the cooks are awesome. Food comes quick, it's always hot, and wonderful.  The whole place is about 12 feet wide and seats about 28 people but the service is so good they move people through pretty fast.  Worth the wait when there is one."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Epic breakfast menu with big portions. Really cute small place, very clean and well-kept inside. Great service. Coffee is just okay, but that won't stop me from going back!"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Best place to get breakfast in tenderloin. Their speciality bacon is a must try! Staff is friendly and service is pretty fast. The food is very good with a large selection. Fresh pressed OJ is also a good sign of a great breakfast place.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Don’t let the small entrance or the outside of it detract you from trying this amazing place. The food is made really close to you and you can practically see it being made. People are nice and attentive. I will for sure come back!
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"After the price shock, I must say this was an amazing breakfast. The Benedict was perfect. The amount of fruit was generous vs other breakfast spots. The hash browns were probably the best I've had and the pancakes were very unique. Highly recommend. Spent $50 for two people though."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Loooved the veggie burger, probably one of the best I ever had. Even though it looked so huge, it didn't feel too heavy on eating, and also felt very healthy. Their bun was perfect - so light and crunchy. I am definitely going here again for the burger."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Great place for breakfast. They do simple food well. This cafe runs seamlessly from the kitchen through to the waiters - efficient and good service. The menu has a lot of options for such a small kitchen too. The eggs were excellent and the fresh orange juice was delicious. The queue ran out the door but it moves reasonably quickly - and it’s definitely worth the wait.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"If you’re in the Union Square district of San Francisco and are looking for a “not your typical” breakfast, try the Taylor St Coffee Shop. Don’t let first impressions stop you from walking in and sitting down. A small narrow restaurant where the kitchenette size cooking area is right up front. 1. Coffee is good! 2. Variety of food. We both ordered the (healthy) Primavera Omelette. A large serving. I am told (after the fact) that the Millionaires Bacon plate is a must.  Next breakfast I will be sure to try it."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"I went near closing time on a Saturday. No line, solidly decent breakfast. Small place, but truly good food and the staff was friendly too. Price was a little high for my liking though ($28 for two scrambled eggs with ""millionaire bacon"" [even if that was the highlight of the meal, changing $20 just for that is too much, I think], a well- sized hashbrown, and tea)."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Spicy scramble was one of the better breakfasts I've had in a long time. Way better than average coffee. Fast and friendly service.  Very small and busy as expected with the quality food they're putting out
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Hollandaise hash with millionaires bacon was amazingly good. Would have given 5 stars but the coffee is so so.  The place itself is a hole-in-the-wall but clean. Expect a little wait as there are not so many tables.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Amazing brunch food! Such a small joint, but their service and food was amazing. We had the sailors hash, hollandaise hash and side of  millionaire's bacon. It was so good! Millionaire's bacon is definitely worth it. Definitely come again here"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Absolutely heavenly breakfast place. All kinds of eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes and French toast ; as well as their millionaire's bacon. If you happen to go, do not miss out on their Hollandaise Hash, it is delicious, the jalapeños infused onion gives it just the right kick of spicy and sour. The eggs cooked to perfection, and the cornflakes crunchy french toast was an exceptional experience. My husband ordered the Californian Omelets and he liked them just as much as he liked everything else."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Right across the street from the Union Square Hilton  The millionaire bacon is to die for! Easy walk-in reception, and this just feels like a cozy hole in the wall cafe. I ordered mine to go and it took 10 minutes."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Amazing food! Great service. Came for breakfast at lunchtime. Not too busy. It's a cozy spot - not a large place. The millionaire's bacon is incredible! It’s a must-try!!! Expect to spend at least $20 per person. Pricy for some people for breakfast, but worth every single penny."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Top breakfast spot in the area. Food is really good. Place is cozy and small. Worst part is the service is not friendly or personalized. Servers are overworked and running so have difficulty being personable. But I definitely recommend this spot. You might have to wait up to 30-40 minutes for a table. However look at my reviews and avoid other places in area.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Great breakfast place and wonderful millionaire bacon (seen on Discovery Channel). Very nice and lovely place, a little small but you don't need more space with this kind of plates and with so nice people working in here. Suggestion is to go early in the morning because of a lot of people waiting for breakfast."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Great breakfast find about four blocks from Union Square and the St. Francis hotel. I had the bacon benedict that included the Millionaire Bacon. It was outstanding!! I also had the fruit that was excellent but the bacon is really outstanding! It’s pricey but then I expect it in San Francisco. If you want a cheap breakfast go to McDonalds. If you want a great little spot come here!
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"We arrived at 1015am on a monf ay morning and there were 10 people ahead of us in line. We were seated after 10 minutes approximately, so the wait was not bad at all. The menu had a trademarked item  called Millionaires Bacon, which I elected to try. The Blackstone Benedict which included the signature meat was an excellent meal. The hash brown was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Hollandaise tasted fresh, English muffin soaked up the juice of the bacon and runny egg and the meal was great until the last bite. My wife had the Taylor hash which was delicious as well. The freshness of the ingredients is evident here. This along with speedy and attentive service makes Taylor Street Coffee Shop a great place to have breakfast."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Oh my God, try the Bacon.  It sounds crazy, but it's shockingly good.  It's spicy and sweet.  It's also very thick...like use a knife thick.  It's a bit expensive, but it's a must try.  Also, try the Sailor's Hash.  It feels weird to order seafood with eggs, but it works out.  Overall, worth a try. Just plan to wait for a table and be careful if you're claustrophobic.  The whole restaurant is like 10 feet wide."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Amazing food and service. The best salad ever !!! 💯 recommended
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Located across from the Hilton and a wonderful alternative eating location. Cost extremely reasonable...meals well presented... fresh and full of flavour. Most times there is a line-up but worth the wait.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,Have been here several times now on my visits to San Francisco. I love Taylor Street even though it is a very small venue. The food is always spectacular the service is always incredible and that is why I continue to come back. I have to get the million dollar bacon every time I come because it is such a unique menu item. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a good breakfast to start the day.
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"A great please I like to stop by for breakfast. All kinds of dishes you can wish for for breakfast or lunch. So far the food was great but be prepared for some waitinh time as the location is rather tiny. The only thing I am lacking is a decent coffee. If you are a coffee lover like me, make sure to get it someplace else, they only have drip coffee."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"I was making audible moans the whole time I ate this meal. Just phenomenal. The ingredients are so fresh and flavorful. I put extra salt and hot sauce on everything I eat - but this meal was so packed with flavor and perfectly seasoned - I didn't even have to salt it. Speedy friendly service, very busy, line out the door. Great coffee."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"As a refuge from the rain, this small cafe was just the right place to stop for a quick meal. The food was delicious, and the service was warm and welcoming. I would definitely come here again."
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"You would walk right by this place and never suspect they have one of the finest and most wholesome brunch spots in town. Don’t be thrown off by the location or lack of “insagrammable” decor, this place has a solid breakfast if that’s what you’re looking for. Right across from the historic Glide Memorial Church, this place is everything you’re looking for with Sunday brunch without the lines or fanfare. We got the chorizo scramble which packs a punch with a side salad and a diverse platter of fresh fruit. We’ll be back!"
Taylor Street Coffee Shop,375 Taylor St,"Bug infested coffee shop! I was sitting down waiting to be served. Out of nowhere, I seen something crawling on the wall. I thought it was a cockroach. I jumped out of my seat and yelled. The server came up and killed it like she’d killed bugs plenty of times. It was some other creepy-crawly. As we were leaving, my daughter saw another creepy-crawly on the window! For the food, it was okay. I got the millionaire bacon… It wasn’t worth my money. It was more like maple, chewy, very greasy pig meat. I was expecting it to be crispy. The French toast was okay. The pancakes and the real bacon my daughter had was so much better than what I ordered. The restaurant itself was so tiny that everyone had to stand against the wall for people to pass. Not recommended!"
