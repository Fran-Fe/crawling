Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I love home coffee! this is my to go place. there are many tables you can come by yourself or with friends to study or just hang out . The menu is big so there's things for everyone. All of the drinks that i've tried are good, I have no complaints. The flavors are there, and the baristas always make cute latte art. The pastries are delicious too my favorite one is the banana bread."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Great place to grab a coffee or tea and work. They do a really great job with the designs in the drinks. A good amount of seating and outlets for work. Definitely would come back and visit again.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"If you'd like a skillfully made, colorful latte, this is the place for you.  This coffee shop has indoor seating and some benches outside, a restroom, and free WiFi. Pastries and coffee-related merchandise are sold here, in addition to drinks. They have less expensive drinks, but I ordered the Birthday Cake Latte, which was $7.06 after tax. Cash, card, and contactless are accepted here. My drink was ready in about four minutes and came in a jade green cup with a matching saucer because I ordered it for here. It was colorful and delicious as expected. After I finished my drink, I used the restroom, which was all the way at the back, passing by some art on my way there. Overall, this is a great place to get coffee quickly, a place to get some work done, or a place to splurge on a fancy latte."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Got the cookie butter latte which was pretty good. Overall this place stands out bc they have a lot of creative sweet coffee drinks with fun presentation.  My friend lives in the area and this is their go to cafe when looking to treat themselves to a coffee brewed outside of the home
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,I tried the Birthday Cake Latte and it was fantastic! Sprinkles gave it just the right amount of sweetness. There are plenty of tables for seating and it wasn’t too busy around 10am on a Sunday but got more busy around 11-noon. The baristas were friendly and overall the coffee shop gave off a great atmosphere.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"My favorite coffee shop in SF! They are so friendly and always make cute latte art that sparks joy 🐱🐶☕️ recently they added goods shelves full of fair-priced home coffee supplies. If you grab a bag of Home Coffee Roasters coffee, you get a free cold brew or drip! I only wish they had more vegan specialty lattes. Most of the flavors have skim milk or cream in them but if you are ok with that, you can still get the latte steamed with nut milks, so depending on your preference, you could get away with a mostly vegan latte. Otherwise your options are whittled to just a mocha (or a non-latte option ofc)."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Clean dine-in space, friendly staff, and tasty sweet coffee drinks. The Seoul Much Avo toast is also great. Only downside is the pricing. I know it’s SF but over $19 for an iced latte + avocado toast (+$2 to add an egg!) is a bit much."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The Lavender Latte & the Bacon/Egg Avocado Toast are my favorites. Excellent Beans. Very friendly, relaxed atmosphere. If it was more affordable, I’d go everyday."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Great seating with lots of outlets! Good work environment but also a fun place to bring friends! Try the Cookie Monster or Birthday Cake if you want photo-friendly lattes :)
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"This is an amazing place to taste incredible coffee. Today, I enjoyed a lavender latte. 😋"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Went looking for a light brunch on a Saturday, saw Home Cafe on Yelp and decided to give Home a try. Lucky us! From the Nutella latte to the Cinn-ful toast to the Chicken Sausage Pesto toast to the mango Tart dessert everything was delicious, the service so friendly, and the Cafe was clean. The vibe here is young but didn't feel out of place. Not hipster, all the food was as described. Trying to find another time to go back Home!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Oh home. I was in San Francisco for about three weeks and I came here about half of the time. I love some things and not others. They have a lot of options.  Coconut vanilla latte hot or iced is fire.  Cookie butter latte is hit or miss. I got it iced so the cookie butter was solid and at the bottom and didn’t taste special because of that.  Birthday cake latte is popular but it doesn’t come iced and in my opinion it wasn’t good hot. I didn’t enjoy it at all so I came back the next day for my usual coconut vanilla latte.  Matcha latte hot was average and not worth the money.  My complaint is that they only have one size, so often id Order two lattes to make up for it which is an arm and a leg.  Oat milk is an extra $1.00 which is honestly outrageous but normal for the area. All of the coffee shops in the area charge that much for oat milk which is wild because it’s not that expensive.  An average latte here with oat milk will run you $7.00 ish, which is a lot, especially for one size and especially if you’re coming daily.  Lastly, if you’re in a hurry, the wait is typically long. I often was waiting about 10 minutes to get my coffee after ordering because they’re packed. Which is a good thing but also not so much. Overall, this was definitely one of my favorite spots to frequent. I did find other shops that had their plus’ but nothing compared to the coconut vanilla latte hot or iced.  Also, currently there is no indoor dining and that has no impact on my review"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Great spot. I ordered the birthday cake latte and a Cookie monster latte. They're both delicious and the birthday cake was a bit sweeter. They have a number of different creative coffees to choose from and they are all delicious. The vibe is great and the staff are the nicest!  Tables are marble and perfect for the gram too ;)
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The pictures look great for Insta but it isn't that awesome. Its just kinda missing that ""it"" factor to me. They should try to get more dynamic with their spices and combinations.  The two winners were what my date got, the pesto on brioche and the Christmas Latte. Both were easily a 5 star breakfast but mine (the one with radishes was too Plain Jane. Still a nice place to pop in on a weekday but you are better off heading down the hill to the bakery in the Outer Sunset . . . If you don't know, figure it out"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Beautiful little coffee shop with staff who are super friendly. I had a cute and colourful #birthdaycake latte and milky way french toast. Both were so very delicious and enjoyable, yet filling! They have a delightful seating atmosphere, and they encourage engagement and communication amongst customers."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I really enjoyed this little cafe. I love the coffee menu. Having a lot of fun flavours to try out. We had the lavender and also the salted caramel and they were both amazing. Definitely give the lavender a try. It was very unique and very yummy.  I liked the simple menu for food. Although it was quite limited, the food tasted amazing and they really nailed it for flavour and also speed."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Awesome latte art. I ordered the red velvet and hit wasn't too sweet, which is perfect for me. I'm not a big fan of sweet coffee, and this really hit the spot! My partner went for the birthday cake latte and she said it was beautiful and delicious! The staff is really friendly."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I found out about Home cafe from their IG page, noticing how appealing their latte arts are! Latte art is just a bonus, their menu is unique and have a lot of items that most cafes/coffee shops don’t have!  I tried out their Birthday Cake Latte, comes with their rainbow art and sprinkles on top...it was too pretty to even drink! It was sweet and light, I wasn’t disappointed in the flavor.  I also tried their Cookie Monster Latte, with comes with those cereal cookies on top of it! I could barely taste the cookie flavor, it mostly just tasted like a regular latte with a hint of chocolate chip cookie flavor. I really want to know how they flavored it for it to taste like a cookie! I was hoping it would taste more like cookies than latte, but it was still good!  Customer service was excellent, the cashier who rung me up and also made the drinks was super nice and did an amazing art on the drinks.  Definitely will be coming back to try their food items whenever I’m in the area"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Great place for coffee and to have a conversation. Definitely not for studying; place is slightly small and they have tables specifically where no laptops are allowed. Birthday cake (top) and Holy cow (bottom). I had the Holy cow, it was great!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"After stopping by Clement Nursery down the street, we HAD to try Home coffee roasters! Thankfully they had various affogato - YUM, I must say! Both the espresso and matcha were so delicious. Their beans also have the cutest packaging on it! Will def be back and can't wait to try the other goodies"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Such a warm and inviting place. You can tell everything here is done with care and compassion, from making a smile inducing latte to the way you’re greeted and treated by the warm and friendly staff. Finding a cafe full of people simply out there trying to make the world a little brighter and happier place truly makes me feel grateful to call San Francisco home. ❤️ Many thanks to the thought and kindness behind everything and everyone at this shop!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Very cozy place, full of young people with their laptops. It can be called workplace cafe as well;) the ceiling is high and bright, with a window open to the sky. The must try is egg sit in toast;)"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Not sure how I haven’t reviewed this place yet here it is now! Some of the nicest staff (shoutouts to Carolyn, Carl and Daniella, James and Katie, especially) and beautiful looking lattes. The owners In and Annie are amazing and how they take care of their staff shows through how their staff takes care of the customers. Come on through and enjoy!! I guarantee you will!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,So many lates to choose from! We ended up with only cold brew but will be back to try a rose late or birthday cake late!  Cute space. Very clean and friendly. I also like that they discourage laptops! Will be back to test out some of those gluten free donuts!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I actually came here on the day of my birthday to get the birthday cake latte. It's pretty and totally something you would post on IG, but it did not taste that great. I love birthday cake flavor in general and though it was that. I guess just how it looks is ""birthday cake"". It tasted like a regular unsweetended latte. Not really impressed. I also got the chicken meatball pesto toast which was pretty good, but I wasn't super impressed either. I felt like I could have easily made that at home with my bread, jar of pesto and my frozen meatballs.  Overall, it's a cute place with free wifi (the ask that you only stay for 2 hours though), but the food and drink I had was just mediocre."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I found their cute latte art on Instagram, so I went to Home SF. Their latte art is so cute and beautiful. I love them. However, this latte art might hurt a latte's taste a little bit. I don't care about that though. When you go there with friends, staff members will make you guys different latte art. I wanna try a different one next time.  Inside the coffee shop is fine. Local people seem to enjoy there routinely. Some people use laptop PC, so Home might have Wi-Fi. I will try that next time. Recently, San Francisco is cold, so it's a good idea to keep warm there!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The place for “Speciality lattes”. You wouldn’t think rose and coffee went together but it was surprisingly good. They have many more options like birthday cake latte, hazelnut latte ... They also offer a few toasted brioche and toppings options."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Cute coffee shop that I wish I had near where I live! They have unique flavored lattes (salted caramel, red velvet, etc) and different kinds of ""toasts"". The vibe in the cafe was awesome and everything tasted great!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Came here because of the instagram hype of the cake latte, but was pleasantly surprised. The drinks are legitimately good and food is good too! The space is very homey/Scandinavian-esque in my opinion, so it’s a great place to bring your parents or a friend to just catch up over a pretty Birthday Cake Latte.  I’ve also tried a few of the other specialty drinks and they were good as well, so even though the cake latte is pretty, done be afraid to venture out!  If it wasn’t so busy on the weekend, I would actually make this one of the spots I’d work out of when remote."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,A great spot to enjoy some drinks and chat with friends or do some work! The drinks here are wonderful (my personal favorite is the lavender jasmine tea latte; it is so wonderful and I’m missing it).
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Solid coffee, excellent service and friendly staff. The avocado toast was as fresh as you could hope for too which made for a nice pre-Sonoma/Napa brunch."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"This shop is the epitome of an SF coffee shop- dainty, hipster, and photogenic. Their coffee and latte drinks are what brings people in- but the simplicity yet complexity of it all is what keeps people coming. Their breakfast toasts can be slightly pricey, but they're good for sharing."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Its so nice here! They have really fun and unique flavors of coffee, the shop is very cute, and the staff are always really nice! Pretty good tea selection along with coffee including a few tea lattes. Good pastries if you get there early enough and they make a great toast if you want some food too. They have all the alternative milks including oat, soy, and others."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,I stumbled upon this little coffee shop and it was so homey and delightful! I liked how cozy and handmade everything felt and really enjoyed my Mint chocolate latte. I will definitely be coming back!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Super cute cafe with warm friendly service and drinks as artful as they are delicious. I got the birthday cake latte and my sister got  the lavender latte. It didn't taste like a bday cake (it's a regular latte) but it was fun, tasty and hit the spot after walking the 16th street steps and taking in the views at the top of Grand View Park."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Went there after seeing its success from Instagram. Cute place and good options. The matcha toast was alright, ordered it more for the pictures than for the taste."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"This is my second time at Home, and everyone was as friendly and lovely as they were my first visit. Two of the baristas, James and Christine, remembered me from a couple weeks ago and offered fantastic drink recommendations. My rose latte was delicious! 💕 I’m coming back as often as I can. …"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Great little spot for some Instagram worthy picture perfect shots of your drink! At first I wasn't sure how a birthday cake or other odd flavors would taste but I went with the hazelnut mocha along with the b day cake and they were both really good! Authentic taste and exactly what the drink description says. It's a cozy spot and even though you can't sit inside, it's worth stopping to grab some coffee."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,This is a great cafe to work from and the people are accommodating. My favorite latte is the red velvet latte and I like the eggs in a basket toast.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,This place has amazing coffee and customer service is great. Only downside is the line out the door but it’s a common thing during the pandemic. Definitely recommend the chocolate mint latte and hot chocolate
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,I’ll be back.  Great service - took the time to explain espresso shots to me. Lovely interior.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,First time here. Shop was really cute and all the drinks look very creative. I thought the birthday cake latte was going to be too sweet but it wasnt. It was pleasantly creamy and the coffee still comes through
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Very nice lattes of various tastes!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I almost don’t want to review because i don’t want it getting crowded ha... on foot this was 1 of two places i could go for refuge from cold and for a morning bite, and needed to hop on my laptop. Greeted right when i walked in, super sweetie took my order. A mix of people meeting to chat socially (signs on the first 5 tables say no laptops which i appreciate) and the whole back area had workers quietly typing away...  Cozy festive decor for valentines and a delicious sweet chai latte— the silkiest I’ve ever had! And pretty latte art to brighten my day."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Fun coffee (and tea) drinks and tasty toasts. A really cute atmosphere. One star removed because it's definitely a bit pricey for the food and I found the beverages to be a bit too sweet.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Fantastic place! When you arrive they greet you with phrase ""Welcome home"" 😊🏡This is a small detail which makes you feel welcomed and creates memorable experience. Food ia very delicious and fresh. Coffee ☕ art is something worth to see and to try - Fantastic!!! Highly recommended to visit.  Suggestion to management : do laptop fee policy on the weekends. More people will be ably to enjoy your fantastic place."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Relaxed and cozy, this place is great for a quick and tasty cup of coffee or tea. Food menu is pretty limited but everything they have accompanies your drink of choice very well. I got Organic Macha Latte and gluten free muffin, it was delicious! Their coffee art is cute, definitely an entertaining aspect for everyone"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Great coffee here. We swing by here to buy coffee beans before we head back to Socal. We will be back for more.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Best place ever! They treat you like family and the food it's simply amazing! If you go there, you will really enjoy the food and company!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,I went here with my wife to celebrate her birthday. The staff were sincerely friendly and although our two coffees took a while they were delicious. It’s understandable that our order took long because we went mid-Saturday morning.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Very cool place. Coffee all looks amazing and tastes great also. Egg toast was really tasty
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,I found Home Cafe to be quaint and lovely in atmosphere. I found the staff to be very kind and welcoming. I loved the birthday cake latte. It was sweet but not overly so. I love their pastry and toast selection.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I've been here a couple times and I love their ""Br-Avo"" and lavender latte-- their lavender latte is probably my favorite of all floral lattes I've ever had. 💜"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Very friendly and fast service with a smile (: Didn't have any sugar free options,  I went with Rosemary and honey with almond milk, suggested by cashier. Different for sure but tasty.  Bravo toast is very delicious."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Love this place! Workers are very friendly and find it cute they say, ""welcome home"" when you walk in! The latte art is insta worthy and tasty 😊 I do recommend their condensed milk toast! It was super delicious! …"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"This place is super cute. SUPER cute. Came here for my birthday to get a birthday cappuccino. (It was adorable, by the way) Even had an accident with the cappuccino and the barista was nice enough to make me another. The employees are so super sweet! 💕 …"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,The food is awesome including their avocado based toasts. Their selection of coffee options including types of lattes is broad yet retains quality. The only downside is that it gets busy during weekends and other non-working days.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Pretty well, but not easy get parking , I order coke-tastic & Cookie Monster , the coke mix with coffee and top of ice-cream is so special , not bad is like sparkling coffee with vanilla ice-cream, and the Cookie Monster hv cookie on top"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Good coffee, good service & reasonable location. Typically get americanos, but decided to try the sweetened condensed milk latte with an added shot. Satisfied with my decision. It had a very subtle & balanced flavor and the milk was v frothy."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"ADORABLE!  Bucket list place! Great music, and cute decorations. The coffee is just what you’re looking for."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Great place; unique coffees and delicious toasts. When u went it was pretty busy
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Home Cafe makes normal coffee drinks look magical! It's a fun place to take friends who are visiting. I love the vibe of the shop, and also the service was quick. The drink was beautiful and delicious! 10/10!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I'd say that this spot is a mix of people who are socializing, studying and doing work.  Pros: -They have wifi and outlets -The coffees are tasty  Cons: -The wifi has been spotty (and doesn't always work) -It's crowded and sometimes there are no open spots -The food/drinks are pretty pricey"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Love it here! Great food, Great drinks, Great atmosphere. Lovely staff. Highly recommend!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Very inventive drinks and friendly staff. 100% would recommend.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Convenient location, but the drinks weren't impressive. Coffee was only so-so. And the Lavender Latte was too sweet. Not my kind of local café, but those who enjoy chatting with friends loudly in a crowded café would like this place."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The walk here is a bit uphill, but 1000% worth it. All three locations are incredible. The baristas are SO talented!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"They really do make you feel at Home. Great people,  great atmosphere, and amazing coffee.  Don't forget to try a toast."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Delicious chai lattes in a cute little homey space.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,It's the best coffee shop in town with the most creativity. It's always busy and the tables are usually taken by people with their laptops
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"It's a cute little place. They say, ""Welcome home!"" to everyone that comes in. I came here while I waited for my oil change. The staff was very nice. They have a decent sized menu: mostly coffee, toast, and a sandwich or two from what I remember. I had the Nutella hot chocolate. It was good. They even wrote my name, José, on the marshmallow. They also have free Wi-Fi, just ask. I'll make sure to come again."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Absolutely one of the best spots for coffee in all of the Bay dont miss your chances at a cookie filled coffee
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The best latte ever. We've had the lavender and the nutella, all the recommendations for the lavender one, it is guest's favorite for a reason!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,My friends and I were not disappointed. We got the birthday cake latte and the red velvet latte.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Home cafe is the best place! They make the best latte art!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Amazing coffee choices and bakery stuff!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,It's no surprise that people have come to love this place as much or more than their own home. After the pandemic hit there were only two things you could rely on- your family (or friends)and Home made goods like these tasty birthday cake lattes which helped me get through tough times when everything else seemed hopeless at first glance.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Adorable coffee shop with a wide variety of drinks and bright interior. The coffee was good, but we got drinks to go so we didn't get a chance to sit down."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Amazing little cafe!!! Their birthday cake lattes are awesome and colorful, and they don’t just look great but taste great as well."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Wonderful ambiance! Beautiful aesthetic! The best part was the food and exquisite barista art! Love this place and highly recommend!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"This coffee shop was most likely the most peaceful place I visited. What transpired in that room will never leave my mind. The personnel was kind, and the coffee and sweet pastries were considerably nicer to those I had previously had. Thank you very much to Jessica, the server, for being such a darling!! I will undoubtedly return!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Really like the birthday cake latte surprise. Looks fancy and taste good.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"One of my favorite cafes in San Francisco. The menu is limited, but everything is tasty and prepared fresh. Good coffee and a friendly, young vibe in a neighborhood where there are not many other outstanding cafes."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"My favorite coffee shop, every weekend is great when you can start it at home."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I wish my experience had been as nice and welcoming as others’. Unfortunately, while I silently and patiently waited in line, an employee got very stressed out and told everyone in line to leave for being too loud. All of the people quietly waiting to order looked at her in confusion so she reiterated that we were too loud and had to get out of the cafe"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Home is one of my favorite places for a fun and exciting coffee. It's not cheap, but I can see why; they really make some delicious coffees and drinks here. I also had a toast while I was here (can't remember the name but it had eggs), and it was so unique and delicious! I can't wait to come back."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"A bit pricey, but the place is cozy and clean. The lattes are also super pretty and nice, and the food is good too. Overall a good experience."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Amazing espresso macchiato and the rose latte was a nice surprise, very good!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,The latte art is the best I've seen. I challenged them with a hippo and they without experience nailed it.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Very cozy coffee shop. Delicious coffee and lattes. Have milk substitutions. (Soy, almond and milk) Just be sure to ask. Their most gram worthy drink is their birthday latte. Hazelnut and vanilla flavored I asked them to just put a tad little so it’s not overly sweet. Their regular cappuccino is pretty solid. There’s meter parking outside. Will definitely visit again. I went during lunch, so it was busy and not enough seating. Recommend going after the lunch rush. Closes early by 5pm."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,One of the best coffee shops I’ve ever been to. Delicious avocado toast. You MUST order one of their special drinks. They are delicious. I ordered an iced Red Velvet Latte and got a Cookie Monster Affogato to go. I just had to try another one.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"It is a beautifully cozy place, great to start your day with the friendly staff. Do make sure to check out their interior collection. The menu is also all inclusive and kind of unique. I had slated caramel hot chocolate-to die for. And cinnamon sugar toast- creepy, sweet but not excessively and perfect timing of cinnamon on butter. Overall it was a great place and I would definitely come here over and over. I won't be surprised it this becomes my favorite breakfast place."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,A beaut latte indeed. So perf for IG. But this place also draws that crowd - lots of “micro influencers” documenting every second of their lives. Find me making faces in the back of every photo taken here.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,First time experiencing this coffee shop. Carl was an amazing help and very friendly. Felt very welcomed and he went out of his way to help my party of 7 get seated. He recommended a Cookie Monster for me and it was amazing. definitely would come back here
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"This cafe is so cute, and their drinks are tasty and gorgeous! My friend who was visiting out of town made us keep coming back here because she wanted to try so many drinks. I had the lavender jasmine tea latte, rose latte, and the red velvet latte - they were so good and beautifully prepared!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Great place to work/study. They close at 5pm, which is kind of early for me. They have such creative drinks and there is always something new to try. They are friendly with those who bring their laptops. Very popular place for students. Sometimes it gets so crowded that you have to share with other patrons. Really nice staff. They always greet you and wish you goodbye."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"A very good and quiet bar, perfect for work with a laptop or drink something with friends!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Great coffee, good service, no waiting."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Really tasty coffee. I got a Lavender latte with oatmilk and a Vanilla Coconut Latte and both were fantastic. Cute latte art too! The chocolate Mochi brownie was enjoyed by my 3 yr old and myself. Very pleasant service as well ☺️
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I have been coming here since they opened. The business owners and all of the baristas are super nice! They serve counter culture coffee here, and it tastes great as well. I personally am a big fan of their cold brew, their hangover (an Americano but with sparkling water), and their lavender lattes. The place is a little small and can get very crowded,  but people are very nice about sharing tables. Also make sure you try their toasts, they're so good!!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I really love their specialty flavored lattes, though I normally just enjoy black coffee or a dry cappuccino. The rose latte is my favorite. Their toast is delicious. The location is small and there’s usually a bunch of students in here. I’ve tried coming to do some work and it’s been difficult finding a seat. Definitely a gem in the sunset."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I always enjoy going to this coffee shop! It is such a quaint coffee shop and there is always plenty of comfortable seats to sit. Lots of choices to choose from that would definitely satisfy your taste. All of the staff are very friendly, accommodating, and always happy to serve. I would highly recommend this place to everyone."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The drinks are not only Instagram worthy, but tasty. Drinks are priced around your average Starbucks lattes, which for San Francisco is a great deal. Service was excellent and the cashier was super friendly. Due to it's popularity know that there can be a long wait time in ordering drinks and the cafe is very small."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Got the iced coconut vanilla latte with oat milk it was so good. would come again. Cute quiet atmosphere. Has wifi!!!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"The coffee is really good here. I like the creative drinks they offer as well. Ive had the Birthday Cake, Ube Latte as well as the Nutella Latte...all very good options. The latte art is always something cute and photo worthy, I never have time because i just like to enjoy the drink lol. I have yet to try the food so thats next on my list."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,First time here and it was pleasant.  I just had coffee and a pastry but will come back again.  It was a little busy (Sunday morning) so I didn't feel like I could really enjoy my time there.  Decor was really nice. The breakfasts sounded really yummy.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Great coffee, but the place is so badly organized. I was waiting for at least 15min to get a coffee and there was no waiting line. I suppose many people order on line. Also, the girls making the coffee were quite rude. I won’t go again."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I loved this cafe!! Aside from their unique and creative lattes (and super cute latte art), the staff were friendly and warm. The space was very cozy and they had tables where no laptops were allowed. I liked that- we really ought to enjoy one anothers company more and put the devices away."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Awesome little spot to get coffee and a quick bite. The avocado toast is their speciality and it is very delicious and not too heavy. I would recommend this place to anyone that lives or travel by frequently. It's a bit pricey which is why it didn't get 5 stars.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,This is my favorite coffee place. Delicious coffee with fun flavors. The specialty toasts are also great and well worth the price. Plus the staff is friendly and they make adorable latte art.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I only had coffee. It took an unreasonable amount of time to wait in line for it. The place serves food too so you have to wait behind food orders. They need a separate line for to go coffees. Very good quality coffee. People there seemed very happy. I saw strollers, lots of babies, laptops. Looked like a great demographic mix. The coffee took so long, my car oil change next door was fine before my coffee. They measure every single espresso shot first. It's ridiculous, like an amateur runs the place. It's a burden in customers time to do that. Very loud room, clean, bright, nicely decorated. Near two bus lines: 28 on 19th Ave and 71 Noriega."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"What I love about this place is the extremely friendly staff. Great lighting and atmosphere. Awesome sandwiches and super affordable! Also, their drinks are well presented and will get many hearts when you post them on Instagram. LOL Highly recommended for everyone!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,The bravo toast is such a perfect balance of savory flavors and hint of spice. I absolutely love it with an egg or two on top. The baristas are all friendly and genuine which just makes my day!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Good coffee and one of the best avacado Sandwich
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,This place is cozy and welcoming. My wife and I stumbled across this place on our way to the beach and it was awesome. The coffees nd toasts they offer are delicious. Definitely a SF gem and a must try spot. We will definitely go back when we are in SF.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Fun spot with lots of charm and a long list of creative coffee drinks. Coconut latte and Birthday Cake latte were delicious and true to their respective flavors. Fun latte art was an added bonus.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Prices went up, quality went down sadly. Been coming here for years and was surprised my last latte was 7 dollars and was lacking the usual flavor."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Tried a matcha mochi 🍩 and a pour over coffee. Both were fantastic. …
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,This cafe is so cute. The baristas remember their regular's names and very clearly genuinely care about their customers. The food is deliciously gourmet and Instagram worthy but you can tell is also made with love. It's no wonder this place is called Home because it truly feels like one.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Nice coffee shop. I had latte, it was tasty and had very nice ornament on it.."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"There are tons of cafes in the city, but not all have the creativity and character of Home. The drink menu is clever, coffee is quality (Americano for me, black), toasts are great. Will look forward to having the opportunity to go back until I have the chance."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Great feel like Home ambiance. Good place to study. Great staff. Variety list of unique coffee with artistic cream on top and a selected menu of food and bakery choices. Try the hazelnut latte and egg in a basket toast.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Pricey fancy brioche toast. Lavender mocha and hot chocolate could be hotter.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,This is a cute coffee shop. The decor is so chic and creative.

Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Great drip coffee, always tasty. Interesting latte creations too."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I said for here, but they gave me to go. The birthday cake just look nice but I will not try again. Also the toast is not my cup of tea."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Pretty interesting coffee shop, not big into artisan coffee but this place is an exception! Ordered a churro latte and I was not disappointed! Would recommend to those that like a unique take on their morning bean juice!"
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Recommended by a friend. Love the spot. Had  Birthday Cake Latte with Let's Avo-Cuddle. Both delish! I was told by the lady the latte is not bday cake flavor but inspired. I was totally ok with that. Also she mentioned if I wanted it lightly sweet I could request it so I did. Perfect for me. I loved it! Going back again! Tomorrow in fact!
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Super cute little space with awesome lavender oat lattes

Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"One of the best cafe in Sunset! I tried cookie monster(sweet latte), red velvet latte(the best sweet latte, rose latte(little bit bitter, less sweet, holy milk latter(best choice), and matcha latte(medium sweet). Tosts are also good. But always hard to find seats. So go early and enjoy special coffee and tosts. Also workers are very nice and friendly."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Cute cafe. Tried the signature lavender infused latte with soy milk. It's on the sweeter side which suited my taste. Seating is a little difficult with most people camped out working but was able to find seating.
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"I am a coffee lover and all coffee is NOT the same that's why I adore coffee roasters over a starbucks. I buy small batch coffee from local rosters as often as I can. Their coffee , first thing in the morning was perfect. Nice little place in China Town... so glad this was open during this pandemic."
Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,Pretty good sandwiches and great variety of coffees.

Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Some what of a coffee hound. Its rare you find such quality beans, unique drinks, amazing staff and delicious food. they have the best pastries , and they have my all time favorite breakfast invention. Eggs in A Basket .

Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,The coconut vanilla latte is amazing! Wish I had more time in SF to try all the lattes

Home Coffee Roasters,1222 Noriega St,"Good coffee, but very slow service. Staff wanted to hang out instead of work. Took 15 minutes for two basic drinks.  Will probably go somewhere with good baristas instead of high schoolers on their phones."
