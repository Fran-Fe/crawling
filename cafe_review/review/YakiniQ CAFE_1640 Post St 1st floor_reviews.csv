YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Worst experience ever. Mushroom’s root is not cut. I can even see mud on it. The quality of beef makes me worried about. The smell and taste is unpleasant. The smoke extractor doesn’t work well. Sharp cooking smells.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Very solid ayce kbbq. We opted for the premium option which included more meat variety and sides. Highly recommend the brisket, marinated short rib and pork belly. The steamed egg and cole slaw was also delicious. The staff was also very attentive and frequently changed our grill."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Monday around 1pm First impression: the HOST did not say a word. He was not welcoming. We walked up the host was standing there.NOT A WORD. Ok, so we sign in on the. Little kiosk and wait. Looks at us and acts to be writing something idk. Mind y’all, Half the restaurant was empty. 5ish minutes later after other guests also sign he uses his hands to show us to our table..WE ALMOST WALKED OUT. THE SERVERS were on point, came up to offer water or if we wanted to order more items. Changed our grill as needed, they really did have their customer service on point, only rang the bell once to order more items.. I appreciate the Hispanic/Latinos who worked that day, I know because they spoke Spanish to me That HOST need to learn a few things."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"THIS RESTAURANT DESTROYED OUR BIRTHDAY CAKE BECAUSE WE DECIDED NOT TO DINE WITH THEM  We dropped our birthday cake a few hours prior to our reservation. The place was packed and our reservation didn't go according to schedule. After waiting for about 30 minutes we all decided to dine next door at San Wang instead because of the birthday schedule. We went back to ask for our cake back and the manager was really upset. They gave us our cake back after giving us a hard time. Later when we pulled the box out of the bag, we were surprised and confused to find that the cake was destroyed. The box had a hole in it as if someone stomped on or punched the box. The cake was a nice cake from B Patisserie. This is totally unacceptable. I understand that the change in reservation may have inconvenienced the restaurant but destroying a potential customer's property, in this case, someone's birthday cake on their birthday is NEVER the right way to do business.  Hopes this reaches out to people as their paid Yelp account filters bad reviews."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We always get  Beef Bulgogi, Pork Belly and Spicy Chicken with all the accompaniments. I always use all my dipping sauces and need more, my daughter loves the Kimchi, for me it's the Glass Noodles and the rice goes with everything.  We always get all you can eat. My son has been coming here with his friends for years. Delicious food"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Overpriced, underwhelming food, abhorrent staff. It's becoming apparent that the Asian food scene in San Francisco is severely lacking due to lack of competition and exposure. Never been more thankful for the wide variety of options in the DMV and NYC than after the terrible experience here. I'd truly rather go to the Korean Butcher back home and pay more than double per portion and get meat that's so much better and doesn't taste like it's slowly spoiling than ever return to this spot."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Limited menu of items and kind of expensive (33 and 40 for their tiers). They charge the SF city tax too which is 5% on top of the bill.  I went with my friend and we both got diarrhea for some reason. We also kind of got scolded/tip-shamed for not giving tip which is always uncalled for. The person taking our meat orders didn't understand English well and missed what we said sometimes, but they changed our hot plate often, which was good."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Amazing food and the staff is very friendly and helpful.. the meat was delicious and juicy. We tried the Bulgogi and the rib eye steak.. I also loved the kimchi and the cold noodles... Definitely going there again
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The restaurant was not happy with our tip and decided that that gave them carte blanche to harass us. They dropped off a bill with the tip section circled and told us ""not to leave"" until we had tipped. It is completely unacceptable to threaten customers who just paid more than $30 each for a few dollars worth of meat.  Do not go here."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Really fun experience! Great meat with a variety of choices. Spicy octopus and chicken both have a kick but were good! The garlic chicken was very good! We had a variety of beef items and they were all really yummy!!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,It's pretty good with relatively fast service at the start that kind of gets slower as you approach your time limit. Good variety of meats and drinks. Some of the meats feel a bit unthawed. The vegetables / sides were great.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"I know it's Korean BBQ, but I'm vegan, and I went for a work thing (big group)...I was able to get the veggie bibambop, which was great, but it's $18 and you HAVE TO  get the all-you-can-eat meat bbq for $33 IN ORDER TO ORDER THE bibambop. The 2 people who ate NO meat cost more than the guy who ate 3 servings of brisket.  Ridiculous concept. Maybe have tables without the grill for people like me, but I was in at a table where the grill was being used. I get the sharing part in order to cheat the system, but there's gotta be a better way."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Eat all that you can, makes this Korean BBQ a restaurant that one is willing to wait even an hour to get seated. We tried the pork belly, tongue, octopus the beef and they were all delicious. The only minus point is that you need to wait to get seated."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I was there 2 times. It is a good priced nice and authentic Korean BBQ! I will definately come back next year!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Early into the next morning, let’s say midnight, after I actually enjoyed my meal at this place, I woke up in stomach pains and found myself taking multiple bathroom trips. It was at those times that I realized I had food poisoning! I now question the quality of the meat, the sides (that were sitting there upon my arrival just past opening time, 5pm) and/or the freshness of everything. This sucks, because as I mentioned, I actually enjoyed my meal! No Bueno 😒"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Make sure to do wait-list on Yelp BEFOREHAND if you want to get in! We got lucky and did wait-list 7 minutes before opening and we got in pretty quickly (2 people). Is 3 stars because the food was r e a l l y salty. Even the unmarinated meats. Steamed egg was beyond salty too. Idk I had to drink a lot of water to wash it down. 🥴 The staff was nice though, came in ever so often to see if we want to order more."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"A bit of a wait to get a seat even on a weekday and the waiter will rarely, if ever, stop by the table unless you call - probably because it was a full house! However, the food was great and it was not overprice. Will definitely visit again the next time I am in San Francisco!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The food was amazing and service was fast and friendly. This is def going on my top ten fav restaurants list!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"$21.99 for all you can eat Korean BBQ in Japan  town— very good! You can order three items on the menu at a time, & it’s all unlimited with sides. Extra $1.99 for a side of lettuce. The restaurant has signs at the entryway stating they only seat a minimum of two diners per table, the gentleman who sat me was kind enough to let me dine. I think that’s weird that there’s a minimum, cause a paying customer is a paying customer, but whatevs. I only ordered four things from the menu & didn’t get very far before getting full. The beef belly is flavorless, but fatty & delicious. The octopus is spicy! I didn’t think anything of the three chilies next to the menu item >.<  The galbi is ok, dry & not like the bone in galbi I’m used to, but it was still good. Lastly, I got the large beef intestine-fatty, delicious & flavorful. Brian & a female server were amazing. They helped me with my cooktop & cooking the meats (not that I don’t know how), but they were very attentive for service, price & ambiance. Five stars all around for ambiance, service & food."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,This place has the good meats! The veggies leave something to be desired though. Really great atmosphere that is perfect for big groups.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"First time ever in a Korean BBQ and I definitely love it, they have good quality meet and plenty of options. A perfect place to enjoy cooking your food while having a good time  with your friends. Definitely a must go."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Went for dinner while on business and I was shocked at how much food you can order for the price! Tried all the beef, a spicy pork, and even the spicy octopus. Staff was courteous, prompt, and quicky swapped grill tops Overall, great experience and would definitely recommend."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Amazing Japanese restaurant a different type of dining. Pls remember to book a table or else ur wait is minimum 90 mts on a week end.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Wonderful experience for a first timer at a Korean BBQ! LOL I might be the only one that they have asked (Are you finished eating because we have a reservation coming in? !) I ate 10 items Wooo!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We have been regularly coming here when our wallets can allow a splurge & have always loved the fantastic customer service & especially the FOOD! The boys bustling around a busy room & never missing to cater to us! Always enjoy coming here! A great place to relax, have a hearty meal & share with family & friends 10/10 highly recommended!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Loved this place. Korean BBQ is always great, and they had lots of meats to choose from. Grills didn’t heat up very quick but it was a good experience overall"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Overall, my impression with YakiniQ BBQ is ok. Not the best place for Korean BBQ I have been to, but it's definitely not the worst. Service was nice until rush hour came. It was so crowded that it was hard for us to get attention from the waiters. Food was good, at least to my taste. My recommendation would be Gal-bi (too bad each person is allowed to order this once). My most favorite would be Spicy Octopus. If you are into hot and spicy food, this one is for you. At the end of the meal I also ordered a bowl of tofu soup, which is not included in the All you can eat menu (I wish at least rice and soup were included). Nice place for hanging out."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Cute space with tons of open area, free wifi but a little bit lacking in power outlets. Quiet space as well so I would definitely come back to study  I had the lavender iced latte and I asked for it not too sweet, came out really well and tasted just the right balance of sweetness, floral and espresso."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"My first time here with the hubby and we both liked the place. Is small and i love it! Felt like hubby and i were both eating at home lol. Very good customer service, i really liked how we were served all night. Our waiter was so very polite. I would definitely come back again."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"As far as Korean BBQs go, this one was pretty standard. The space is enclosed and dimly lit, and the options for all you can eat are on the more limited side compared to previous restaurants I’ve frequented. The service is fairly prompt for it being so busy, and they frequently change out the cooking grills. Food quality is about average with a reasonable (for the Bay area) price tag."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"They try to sneak extra charge to our bill. When we found the bill is off and questioned it the manager then said he miscalculated, while he literally checked the bill twice, when he is trying to imply us to leave. The waiters are great though."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I’ve had Korean bbq at some places in Texas. This is fantastic. Makes the best I’ve had anywhere else seem bad.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The person who response to arrange the seats is the worst person！！！！ This person let the seats blank there for two hours！！！not arrange the customers to seat！！Suggest the owner of the restaurant to fire this person！！！
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Food is delicious. The drinks were not to bad ..
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great choice of meats!!! First time I was at a Korean BBQ restaraunt and not only was it delicious but very fun!! Servers are very attentive 😊 …
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Decent KBBQ for the price, but the quality is just okay. The brisket is really chewy and the sides were salty.  The best things were the salad, which had a creamy dressing, and the beef belly (however it was cut into smaller pieces which made it stick to the grill too much)."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The best all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ in San Francisco. Come here to celebrate good friends and good times.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Waitress joy kim wasn’t very helpful, she barely checked on us and when she did , she only walked by to make sure we were eating all of our food. There was hair found in my rice, she didn’t say sorry she just got me more rice. There was no accommodation, there was no apology… nothing.  Thennnnnn they added a tip of 18% to my bill… yes it says 6 or more BUT my party of 7 was split into three groups (me and my child, my two little sisters on their own tab and my best friend and her two kids on another) joy kim definitely didn’t deserve a tip. Customer service was horrible. I wont Be coming back."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"10/02/2019 There were only 2 kinds of delicious beef, another on the menu weren’t delicious, just ok.  The most disappointed was the way they treated me. They told me that if I came alone, I could only sit there for an hour.  If I came with a friend (two people), I and my friend could sit there and eat for two hours.  I arrived at 5pm, my cousin got there at 6pm. They repeatedly say we need to pay and leave the table at 7pm MANY TIMES.  I still don't understand why they just treated me unfairly like this. They were so impolite to do so to us.  That affected negatively the customer experience.  5/10/2021 There is 1.5 year since I wrote the comment above, I haven’t come back to this restaurant. Hopefully, they have improved their customers service. I’ll come back one more time soon to see what they have changed so far, and I will update new review to you guys."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Busy, popular, trendy Korean BBQ in San Francisco. Little bit of a wait because it's such good food. Cook it yourself and be careful not to overeat bc portions are above average. $50 out the door for two people. Tons of meat choices, beverages and large tables for groups."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Some of the best korean bbq in norcal. I feel clean after eating there, like the food went digested well without issues. $30 for all you can eat of amazing meat selections and rice, with unlimited complementary side dishes is a price not many can beat. great authentic environment. my favorite place to eat with friends. be sure to get there when they open though or leave a reservation on the waiting list, it is ALWAYS busy. worth every minute of the wait though"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Good service, fun experience + good selection of food to cook + loads of sides."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Nice and quiet here. It’s cozy and the staff are friendly. My caramel macchiato was great. There’s also a lot of wall outlets which I appreciate. -1 star because it’s a Little hard to find and has slow WiFi.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Delicious, affordable, and great service for how insanely crowded/crazy it was! Note: you have to cook the meat yourself, and it can get a little smoky towards one side of the table (fan not so great), so make sure to request to have your grill changed regularly!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Service was friendly and efficient. My friends and I did have to wait for about 30 minutes for seating, but part of the delay was caused by another group of customers that refused to leave their table after the time limit was up (1.5 hour to order I believe). Since it is AYCE, make sure you order everything you want to eat in a prompt manner. Everything on the menu was so good. We opted for the 29.99 pp option and it did not disappoint. Great value and great vibes. I highly recommend it!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"I suggest, order thin beef first (usually cook fast), then try seasoning chicken or pork or beef later👍 …"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"What an awesome place to eat, and eat a lot of food. The price is pretty simple, you can get a dinner all you can eat for $22 or a few more options for $26 per person. With that you can get as much as you can eat within two hours. They continuously replace the pan so it doesn't burn or char and are always bringing you more food. Waiters and waitresses continuously stop by and ask if you need anything like soju, beer, or soda. If you want to have an eating experience then check this place out, and I would recommend the beef belly it's so good!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,All you can eat Korean Barbecue.. Do I even need to say more ?! Service is fast and friendly but it's very crowded so prepare to wait some time! Nevertheless awesome experience!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,$21 per person for all you can eat Korean bbq is such a great deal
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The wait-list is entirely inaccurate. They don't factor in reservations in the timing so a 50min wait turns into 2hr plus if you are a walk-in. If we'd known that the 50mins was going to be 150 we'd have left and gone somewhere else a lot sooner.  We also wouldn't have known if we didn't ask. That is just bad restaurant management to not leave enough seating for walk-ins that your entire dining room is filled with reservations. They seat ALL the reservations first. Period. So good luck without one.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Health hazard with all the smoke?  Definitely was coughing while eating and watching others cough. Food was really good though!  Update: came here again on surprise with friends. Again smokey, coughing (and sneezing!) with poor ventilation. Food is really good. I just wish they invested in the infrastructure with respiratory wellness in mind."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great food . A little wait , but it was worth it"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great for large parties. Food is great and you cook your own food so you can make it how you like it. Lots of varieties of meats and sides. Gulp down your food with some cold Soju shots or beer. Meat plus Alcohol equals a great time. Only wish they were open later.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Delicious lunch. Make sure youre not going anywhere after though. The food smell will soak in
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Amazing service and fun atmosphere.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,great kbbq place. all you can eat (for 2 hours) lots of options and friendly staff. highly recommend. put your name on the waitlist through yelp if you plan on getting there later than their opening time.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,We fortunately or unfortunately could not get into State Bird Provisions or their next door sister restaurant The Progress and wandered over to this upstairs gem.  YakiniQ's claim to fame is being the first Korean restaurant to offer all you can eat.  The staff is very attentive changing the grill top and bringing out foods 3 at a time.  The portions are HUGE!  We usually have a tribe with us but came for a date night. Recommend you to bring a large group to try everything.  The foods are marinated tastefully.  They were out of the Rice Cake Wrap so we had the Steamed Egg...  it was wonderfully light and flavorful.  Now I am curious about the Wrap.  The chairs double as hiding places for jackets and other things.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We had a truly memorable and enjoyable all-you-can-eat lunch at the very reasonable price of $17.99 per person (plus tax + tip). They bring a few typical complimentary Korean side dishes to accompany the meal. So we started with a huge platter of spicy beef brisket, then fantastic spicy pork belly, followed by fire baby octopus, garlic butter chicken and marinated pork ribs plus rice cake wraps. Everything was delicious, and we literally could not eat any more! The service was really great -- the waitress very attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Racist employees, asking to leave after 45 minutes because the table is reserved for someone else!? Does that make sense? Why you gave me that table in first place?"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We passed by lady night and the aroma from the street was amazing. We came up the staircase to a hip and happening place. The crowd is young and the energy was high. The wait was over and an hour and we were starving from a long day of moving. Several hours later we got a call from the owner, Tony. He apologized for the long wait. Now that is customer service. Who does that?  That phone call and the smell made us know there was only one place in the city we were having dinner on our second night.  We arrived around 10 PM. To my great surprise they were still busy and a line at the door. This time we waited. Great crowd once again. There were large groups, small groups and bday parties. As the guest get up to leave a crew comes out to clean the tables and everything is clean and tidy in what seemed to be about 60 seconds.  We were seated and our Servers name was Moses   What a great spirit and server. He took great care in guiding us through the evenings selection. He was so good that we ended up just letting him chose what came next. If you are new to the s type of food then ask for Moses. Rest assured you will be in the best of hands.  The food was amazing. You cook all the meats on a grill in the middle of the table. The smell is intoxicating and your taste buds water while waiting  for the first round to be ready.  Make sure you bring a healthy Appetite. This is not a restaurant where you want to come and just pick a little.  After our dinner was over, Tony came to the table and made sure our visit was good. Once again demonstrating great customer service and care for the guest. I look forward to attending this restaurant again in the near future."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Very close to Japantown, so makes it relatively easy to find parking (albeit not for free). The spot is very cool, located on the second floor with spaced out tables and vents. Our servers were very accommodating and kind, and the food was great. The selection for halal/vegetarian could be better but overall it was a great experience."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great Korean BBQ place. The meat is delicious. Bulgogi is my favorite. The price is really good for an all you can eat (for two hours). It is usually really packed so you may have to wait for a long time before you can get a table.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Good Korean BBQ place.  The ""Fire Baby Octopus"" was out of this world. Triple red chili pepper rating. Make sure your pitch of water is ready before you try."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Well seasoned and prepared proteins, very clean environment, and friendly staff. If DIY BBQ is your game, check it out."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Typically at ayce bbq we never get great service. I am reluctant to go sometimes just to avoid the rude servers that cant keep up with their tables. This place was just ok, ive had better banchan, better (friendlier) service, better cuts of meat, and more choices at other ayce places than this. Not worth the wait if you see a line."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Decent restaurant, gal-bi beef is specially good!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Would have been four stars but the waitress (head woman in charge of the servers) is rude. Food was actually good and all the others servers seemed nice. I do think it was a bit noisy and the smoke could be ventilated better.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great all you can eat Korean BBQ. I wouldn't say that the meat is the best in quality, but for the price and quantity, YakiniQ is a great restaurant to try!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Staff blamed customer for not making reservations correctly, (we called) then proceeded to forget about us (twice). Leaving us waiting forever. Apologetic and did not own to mistakes. The reviews check out. After pushing, they made it right. So edit (2 star) I hope they get their system fixed"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Sign yourself in at the tablet kiosk upstairs. Select the marinated meats. 15 min wait turned out to be 45min wait. Cook the food yourself All you can eat in 2 hours. Skip the rice and request lettuce instead Very tasty.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The meats are very good and it’s a really fun experience to cook with your friends. I recommend the 29.99 per person option. The food is all you can eat, so make sure you eat as much as you can!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Took the guy I'm trying to make my boyfriend when he asked me where I wanted to eat after Roe v Wade was overturned. (You know. For ""women's choice night"")  Always nervous introducing people to new places, but he loved it. I always do. Brisket and bulgogi were great. I ordered the spicy rice cake side. It comes with rice cakes in there and is probably my favorite Korean dish. Other than the meat of course."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,YakiniQ Cafe is ideal for studying or meeting up with friends over coffee or desserts. They have a wonderful variety of choices. My favorite is their Nutella Latte and affogato.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"While looking for a bite to eat, my friend and I stumbled on this place thinking it was a tiny Korean BBQ place but to our surprise the restaurant was huge and upstairs. Great service and the beef is magical"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,All you can eat in a very nice atmosphere. Staff are working really hard to serve the customers and they will come to your table to ask if you need anything. Delicious cuts of meat. I recommend reserving spot ahead before going because usually it's packed.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We arrived at 4:45 p.m. on a Friday to line up for the 5:00 p.m. opening. By 5:30 p.m. the place was packed. You only have two hours to eat and one server reminded us of this an hour and twenty minutes into our meal by telling us to put in final orders (seemed a bit too diligent). Quick tips: Order a lot at once, bbq while you eat, and wave down a server as often as needed to change the grill. The environment is fast paced, but makes for a fun gathering."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"A Korean ""All you can eat"" BBQ joint that has all the flavors of an old school table grilled eatery in Japantown, San Francisco.  Man this place is GOOD!  The Kalbi beef is on point, the Bugogli has that sweet flavor and the kimchi is like ajummas back in Songton City.  Bring you appetite because you will want to try as many meats as you can. Thirsty?  Wash everything down with an OB Beer, which I haven't seen since I was stationed in Korea.  The staff is friendly, checks on you all the time and switches out the grill when it is needed.  Make no mistake YOU COOK YOUR OWN FOOD Korean style if you order the all you can eat...so be prepared to sling some meats on the grill."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Food was great. No compromise whatsoever for all-you-can-eat restaurants. If you don’t want to wait, call them in-advance before they’re too busy that you’re coming in 15 mins."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The food here is very great and it tastes wonderful :-)
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Super busy but the food is worth it.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Had a bad experience last week because the establishment decided to destroy the birthday cake of our friend when we didn’t decide to dine in. We left the cake prior to our reservation and picked it up after we decided to cancel. Cake was destroyed when we received it and our friends were talked to rudely when getting it. Won’t be going back
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,First time there with friends. Food was great. Fun to cook our own food
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Good meat and loved the chili sauce. Definitely work coming back
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,YaikiniQ has been around forever and might actually have been the first AYCE KBBQ place in San Francisco!  I remember coming here with my friends over a decade ago.  The cuts of meat are excellent and the salad is TO DIE FOR.  I think it's a cabbage salad and the dressing is absolutely fabulous.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Edward, this guy, has no professionalism, behaves bad, calls himself a manager, and then goes onto tell that without having a tip policy, you have to pay a minimum of $30. Takes the food away, and also takes the money away, horribly tells you to leave. Absolute nonsense service, absolutely horrible customer response."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Nice place to hang out with family and friends, good beer, good food💯 …"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great value for 22 bucks. Lots to choose from !
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Korean bbq is one of my favorite things of all time. I have been to NY (jongro bbq), charlotte (lets meat), Atlanta (762 bbq and 9292 korean bbq), and many gyu kaku (its japanese i know). My point is, yakiniq has been average. I enjoyed the food. The quality and variety are not bad, but there are some things that left me wishing for more. I hope the owners reads this because i think there is room for improvement. San Francisco is one of the major cities and all the other places i've been have done a better job at k bbq in my opinion.  What you guys did well:  1) good miso marinate 2)lots of variety 3) maybe this is a bad thing for the people trying to eat every item on the menu but you guys give large portions of meats. 4) fair prices, specially because this is an all you can eat restaurant. 5) most items are fairly tasty  What needs improvement? :  1) only 2 sauces. You guys have one that is a spicy with a wasabi flavor (not bad). But the second sauce is just another extra spicy version of the first one. Where is the sesame oil with salt. Where is the Gochujang, or soybean paste, or a sweet and spicy. Only 2 sauces: one spicy and one extra spicy. This makes it really hard to eat non marinated meats. 2) key side dishes missing. You guys have some good and tasty side dishes like potato salad, kimchi, the glass noodles, cabbage salad and others. But you don't have pickle radish, pickled onion, or a cucumber salad. In my opinion, having some pickled radish wrapped around some meat and kimchi would have made this much better. Lettuce leaves were too big and It took a very long time to refill the side dishes bur that is a minor problem. 3) no oil or lemon for the grill. In many restaurants they oil the grill to prevent food from sticking and burning. And the lemon is to scrub the burned residue. This would have helped reduce how often we needed to change grills. 4) our fan was not working. We were on the older side of the restaurant so i think our fan was just a bad one. Our neighbors had a good fan. Because of that and having to wait a long time for the waiter to come change the grill, we would find ourselves inhaling all the smoke. Not a lot of fun. 5) music was little bit too loud. 6) the place feels and looks old. The stair to the bathroom smells. Probably a renovation is needed but i understand it is a major project. 7) the bulgogi marinate was really average. It wasn't salty or sweet. 8) this is minor but Nothing we ordered had any garlic or green onions. These are typical korean aromatics and I think it would have added a extra layer of flavor to everything.  I would probably given you a 3.5 out of 5 because of the need of a renovation, average ambiance, average bulgogi and the slow service; however, i think 4 out 5 is okay because of the price, the variety, the waiters are hard workers and most items were fairly tasty. Ultimately, this is an all you can eat korean bbq restaurant. Most ayce will  skip on quality and focus on quantity. YakiniQ does some things well but it is not an exception to the ayce rule. if i had more sauces (at least the traditional kbbq sauces), lemon or oil to prevent food burning/sticking, 1 or 2 more side dishes, and fix the bulgogi, i think yall could be a 4.5 out of 5 or even a 5 out of 5 (if you over look the old building) when it comes to ayce korean bbq."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,My families favorite place for occasions! Wish it’s cheaper though
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great atmosphere, perfect decorations, and wide selection of baked goods!! I had the sweet potato latte and it was really good!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The best KBBQ place in San Francisco. The owner treats every customer with great service despite how busy this japan town mainstay is on just about every evening. Well worth the wait. Order the premium all you can eat selection. Well worth it! If you are scared of octopus be brave and try it! Marinaded perfectly and helpful staff make sure you don't overcook your food.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Best value for money, having a great time with friends."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Place actually stops seating at 9:30 but they sat us anyways. Food is fantastic! Highly recommend!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Don't come here for the food, come for the convivial semi co-working aspect of the place, with great fast wi-fi, plenty of outlets and tables arranged almost like you're in the study hall of your school library. Tasty lattes and snacks keep you going -- the sweet potato one is weird but moreish -- and I recommend their amazing macaroons for a sweet and cheap sugar high. Good opening hours, a nice place to chill and a relaxed atmosphere where people don't get to noisy."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great value for money, all you can eat! Meat quality is good, staff very helpful and always ready to get us more meats. Come early it can get busy really fast!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Worst BBQ experience ever! If you like lazy waiters and VERY LOUD music, this is the perfect place... We waited for 2 hours, but were very disappointed. Food is good though."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This place is for 20 something. Loud music and mediocre food that is perfect for the young and ignorant crowd. If you want authentic Korean bbq you will not have it here. By the way if you do not see many Korean people eating here, just ask yourself why that is."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I don't recommend going to this restaurant within an hour before it closes. we went at 8:50PM and it closes at 9:30PM not knowing it's a all you can eat bbq. we had to rush really badly to finish eating 3 meat we ordered since they charge you for the left overs and they reminded us multiple times that they close at 9:30 and we will be asked to leave. they had good sides though
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The food was good but nothing special the place gets very packed very early so make sure you get there as soon as the doors open it also gets very smokey. You're basically paying for the experience and the location
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Been here a few times. The food and presentation are amazing. Make sure you get a reservation
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"I’m so glad I found this place in San Francisco , It was the only Korean bbq restaurant that had the grill on the table so you can cook your meat to your desired taste!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Very good food plenty of good meat chocies...very short 7 min wait called ahead wonderful service and wait staff....came for a birthday dinner..we will be coming again.. And as a plus we got to share the WARRIORS 3rd win with some awesome dinner guest.... All N All we had a very unique evening.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This coffee shop had a charming atmosphere, and the lattes were fantastic. Our hotel was across the street, and YakiniQ Cafe was our morning coffee and breakfast spot.  The quiche was delicious and served with a salad...w/ a light vinaigrette. The croissant with nutella was a great alternative when I wanted something sweet.  It has a cozy atmosphere, with a couch and chairs to sit and chat, but also had tables for people to open their laptops to work, and outdoor seating on the sidewalk in front."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great service. All you can eat option isn't too expensive, it was reasonably priced. The atmosphere is good."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Very quiet place to study, read, or get away from everything. The matcha latte was okay, maybe a little sweet, and the shortbread cookies need more match flavoring. The staff was plain, not really friendly, nor rude. Tipped them anticipating they would provide some service, but that wasn't the case. I thought when they weren't busy, and there were two of them they would have brought out the drink, we were right there. Considering I tipped them close to 20%, I felt jipped."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Easily one of my most favorite places to frequent in the city.  It's by far the best price to experience you can get.  Cheap all you can eat prices, great menu, awesome service.  In the pre-pandemic days this would be the best place to gather a group of friends on a Friday night before going out.  Can't wait to do this again once Covid is over!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great location, surprisingly great prices, and even better food. Would recommend if you're looking for a KBBQ place!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"A really cute place, nice ambience. Good for a quick coffee/snack/light lunch or to get work done in the afternoon, since they have WiFi and plentiful seating (but only if you get there by noon or so, otherwise you'll probably have trouble finding a table near an outlet). Coffee and food is kinda over-priced, but not enough to prevent me from buying something so I can camp out for a bit."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The food was amazing but we kinda had bad service but the other servers were nice except the person who served us yet when we left he followed us to our car asking for a tip yet we had really bad service by that one person. But at least the food was great
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"nice ambiance. ok coffee (good lattes, so-so mochas). friendly service. outlets are sparse and limited to the tables flushed to the wall, and it can be very busy so if you're trying to do work here make sure your devices are charged beforehand."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Good seating, not too cramped and spacious interior. This would ordinarily mean a great spot to read, get some work done, or just sit down for a relaxing conversation with a friend. Unfortunately, the music (modern pop, hip hop, etc) does not fit the interior and makes for a less pleasing than possible experience."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,It's all you can eat. Totally worth it because it's tasty. Probably one of the better KBBQ places in the area. But sometimes service can be kind of slow....
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Love stopping here to work or study for a couple hours on the weekend. It's fairly quiet (not as deathly quiet as a library), but you are not disturbed by other patrons. Wonderful service, free WIFI, water and bathroom in the back. Cafe also has a nice unique selection of drinks and some eats. One of my favorite spots!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Love the food selection. Great service. Good amount of sides. Quick and to the point, will be back"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Very worthy, the meats and the service are great."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,This place gets packed on weekends so make sure to make a reservation before going in. Their buffet style korean BBQ is great and my favorite parts is their service. Great people.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Service is very good. Not that many choices for all you can eat, but overall a decent place to have meals with your friends."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The food wasn't all that great for the price compared to other kbbq spots. The servers weren't paying attention to my table or giving us the right stuff.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Don't forget to order Steamed egg
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Very nice atmosphere cool vibe. The staff and owner are always very friendly, and the coffee is on spot every time I go. Pastries are made by the owner and some are brought in from other sources. They have salads and huge onigiris. Love the place. Always stop in when I'm near by."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Absolutely love this place — fantastic for a group meal. Great sides, good flavours, great selection (even just on the base all-you-can-eat menu). Just know that you will definitely smell like barbecue after you leave!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"I love this Korean style BBQ. Their all-you-can-eat is reasonable, so I’d like to visit frequently. Before going, I’d recommend to use Yelp waitlist to shorten waiting time."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Horrible place! Absolutely Need void it ! We come in because the waitlists of Daeho(popular Korea Restaurant),and there is no charger at all, I ask twice, the owner said no very coldly, and we ordered 2 macaroons (just so so:-(, and coffee(no flavor at all:-(, and my sister need a cup of hot water,she said need pay $1.00 for a cup of hot water?!!!! I never go to a cafe place they will charge your hot water! That’s just so mean and cheap! Never Never will come back!:-( serves suck so horrible!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,We LOVED this place. I will come back every year mutiple times and recommend it to any friends who visit San Francisco. Great price and great food
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Rare are cafes that have good coffee but are also dead silent. This cafe not only has many tables to work with, but also bathroom, water, couches, food, and wifi. People come here for work so don't expect to get chatty and loud here. I came here multiple times to study for my licensing exams and was able to fit in a great session each day. If a day of productivity is what you need, you can certainly find that here!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Really really pleasant Japantown cafe! The atmosphere is cozy and calm and the barista is great. The drinks are a little pricey but there are fun drinks like a lavender latte plus all the normal offerings to choose from. The service is also excellent!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I loved the food my friends and I really enjoyed it! Great atmosphere and service was nice
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Been coming here for years when we crave some yakiniku!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Very good menu and service
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Quick service and fun staff, thanks for the great time"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great food. A little smoky, but hey, it is BBQ right? We went on a Sunday and it was issued so expect a wait but it's well worth it."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"So so quiet here. If you need to get work done without distractions, this is a great option. Sandwich and matcha tea latte were great, though a little pricey. Outlets can be hard to come by, but communal seating is encouraged which helps."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This is my go to Korean BBQ spot, even if there are a bunch of other spots closer to my house. Service is great, food is amazing. I like YakiniQ much better than one of the popular local chains ;)"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Food was very good and tasty, and service was fast (although slightly pushy). The meat was so well marinaded and tasted amazing. Even the sides were well priced (although pickles were free!). The only downsides was poor ventilation and lettuce wasn't free (or at least cheaper)."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,This place is amazing. Great price for all you can eat the staff is so nice and super friendly. I loved how they can and help cut up the food for us when I apparently was struggling. Ha ha love it. Very conveniently located near the Japan Town Mall. Highly recommend go check then out when you are super hungry.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Really good ! Even better when there's no line which doesn't happen often. Came a few times and were not disappointed.  Please let us pre-book a time so we don't have to wait for 1 to 2 hours in the cold, and standing in the stairs. The food was excellent but the waiting time repelled us!  We came back one day when there was no line."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"A quiet cafe serving coffee, tea and light bites. This was a great place to spend the afternoon working, reading, listening to music and grabbing a quick lunch. I'm surprised it wasn't much busier, but I really appreciated the chilled out atmosphere."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Price list, two options: $19.99 or $24.99. Eating time, two options, before 6PM or after 9PM (or up to 2 hours wait in between). Taste, one option only: great.  I wish they offer more drink varieties. Get ready to eat in a very loud and exciting environment. Service is excellent."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Love this place! Have come here multiple times now and have never been disappointed. Very accommodating and even takes reservations ahead of time. Food here is consistent and tasty each time. For what you get it is fairly priced too. Great for social events! Can have all you possibly can stomach and crammed down your face hole. I give this the place the highest of thumbs up and as a bonus they play kpop in the background for the atmospheric appeal.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great staff! They change the grilling plates out for you very often and give plenty of food. Side dishes were great! The lunch special is very worth.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great food. Reasonably priced.  Waits can be over an hour without reservation (only for party of 6+).
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Very friendly, knowledgeable and patient staff. The pricing was also very good."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Haven't been here in some time... Previously had very good experience. That said, this Thurs early eve was disappointing. The very rude counter person (Perhaps Russian accent) should not be working in public service. Really bad attitude. And, the macaroons were old & soggy.  New owner? Shame."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Amazing all you can eat. Just make sure to get here before they actually open so you can easily get a table without too much waiting.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"No more sesame oil and salt dip. When you ask for sesame oil they give you oil but not sure what kind; definitely doesn't taste like sesame oil. Meat is mid, prices are high for what you get. Half menu (no bulgogi) is now 29.99 compared to 24.99 a year ago, and 21.99 2-3 years ago."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,enjoying the unlimited like in Korea
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The best place for Korean BBQ in SF! You get very good quality stuff for the price you're paying. Loved it a lot!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Can't go wrong here, The staff is cool, The food is great, and for $25ish all you can eat /w drink....becoming a regular!!!!!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Really great place to dine in! All you can eat with variety of options for everyone. Staff are really attentive and great service.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"First time going to KBBQ in the city, the meats were delicious and the service was impressively quick getting either new grill tops or food for the table. Was pleasantly surprised that they asked for proof of covid vaccination."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The host started the whole great experience. The side dishes was amazing the authenticity of it. Then the variety of tasty meats filled my stomach. The place is exciting and the staff is helpful and plenty of It. What a great experience...the price was orth the all you can eat....enjoy😁 …
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This place is amazing! Hands down best Korean bbq spot I have been too. This place is great. The wait can be a bit at times but that should tell you it’s worth it. It’s a whole experience! The staff is exceptional, the food is amazing.  This place has withstood the rest of Covid. It’s hands down the best place to be in Japan Town. At full capacity this place get a little smokey/cook meat smell. The atmosphere has always been live."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,You will always find good service and great food for the price here! YakiniQ has been one of my go to spots for years!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We had a huge group and they were very helpful. They were incredibly busy and came off as ""rude"" but that was just because of how much was going on they ALWAYS got us what we needed and answered us if we called them over. Great food and atmosphere!!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,For a great price you can eat more meat here than you ever wanted to. Very delicious! Make sure you shower after to get the smoke smell out of your hair.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Awesome price-quality, great meal. Give all you can eat a try!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"We been here, food is good but service so bad. We ordered 1 dish 3 times, but they just brought in last minute."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Best place ever if you have to feed hungry teenaged boys!  Next time would not choose the premium menu because the boys just didn't appreciate the unique meat options offered (tongue, cheek etc). Food was plentiful, staff were very attentive and polite and the owner was great to talk to and very patient amongst the hungry droves waiting to be served. A definite must visit."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Eastern Euro woman who works in the day time is consistently unnecessarily rude to customers. Including someone who appears to be handicap. Very mean and sharp .. makes customers feel unwelcome. Im sitting in the cafe now, watching her be mean to elderly woman. **Owners should change the staff .... she does not create a nice atmosphere and scares people off with her mean attitude. **** All of the 1 star reviews complaining about the same girl !!!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Quite a long wait for a table, but the service is pretty good, servers all have nice attitude and act quickly. Recommend marinated beef!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Awesome all you can eat Korean BBQ. This place is popular among the locals, so getting there closer to opening time will make it easier to get a table. Delicious high-quality meats."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I only get the all you can eat and drink so I'm not sure how anything else is but the meats + the hot sauce is amazing.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great for group dinners, fast and friendly service and the food was good. Wish there was more sides included such as rice within the buffet price."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Cute, spacious, tranquil cafe where you can relax and enjoy the extensive drink and food options. Sweet potato latte was tasty and not too sweet. Enjoyed the humongous tuna mayo onigiri (a little bland but healthy). They could fit in another large table and a small table if they wanted too.  The macarons are pretty good. So are the cakes that I've tried.  Free WiFi available."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"YakiniQ is DELICIOUS. I had them for the first time when there were indoor dining restrictions, so have only had their bento boxes, kimchi fried rice, and japchae. The bento box portions are HUGE - easily 2-3 meals. Everything was flavored well and were delicious as leftovers.  I can't wait to go back for AYCE KBBQ - the ambiance would make it a great place to go with a group!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This spot is great, fast service, good meats. I definitely would come back."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Randomly found in Japan Town!! Really worth it! Go there before 2pm than they have the lunch special. It’s an all you can eat for max. 17.99$ - and you can choose from 15 different dishes.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Food was great and service was solid. My issue is there's no wheelchair access and even though I'm not handicapped myself I watched a teenager in a wheel chair (helped by two of his friends) basically pull himself up a flight of stairs. Then wasn't even offered a chair to sit in while waiting so he was propped and held up by his friends.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This is more of a 3.5 stars review. Unlimited rounds of meat (3 items at a time). It's super rowdy and loud for dinner so I wouldn't recommend it for a young family. Service is mixed depending who you can catch. The Kalbi was pretty good, everything else we tried was ok and too much sauce. I'd try a different place"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I had been to this place a few years ago and had enjoyed it back then. My more recent visit was less pleasant. I recommend you seek the seats by the window as the ones towards the back boast restroom odors. :/
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Gotta love all you can eat. Although the portions on single items were huge so didn't get to test as many options as we would have liked. Maybe we could have ordered portions for just two although our party had four people in it?
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Went at around 5:30pm on a Tuesday so definitely not so busy. Got great service, the waiters always changed the grills immediately after a round of meat, and the marinated meats were oh so yummy. XD Definitely try it if you're in the area, great experience, and nice people."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The food is really good, but you should know, the costumer service isn’t the best, but thanks Carlos employee how was really friendly and good with us. Thanks Carlos! You guys should have more Latinos there because they are the best!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Long wait, but great food. Short ribs and pork belly are the way to go. Some things on the menu are a little much for me but I tried them once anyways"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Amazing selection of premium meats. Would recommend the expanded menu- it's definitely worth it!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Honestly the food was amazing and the service was pretty fast didn't have to wait
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Reasonably priced! At around 21.99 per person you get to choose from a limited menu of meat that has all the usual k-bbq options such as beef brisket, pork belly, etc. Great atmosphere and good service as well. Definitely a great spot to fill ur k-bbq appetite!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great food. Slow service. Busy. Okay price. Smokey environment from all the grilling.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great food, fast service. Best KBBQ I've had. But the restaurant is a bit dirty when you look up, and the noise level and wait time are pretty bad. Overall it's worth dealing with it all for the food (spicy pork belly), but there are definitely some screws to be tightened."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, a little smoky but that's expected, great food and drinks"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Best Korean bbq place I've gone to when you factor in the food, price and overall atmosphere."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"There's not a day that I wouldn't mind literally eating at this ALL YOU CAN EAT korean bbq. The vibe is great friendly workers convenient bell to request more food so service would be efficient. I gotta also give to their sauce like why can't all the Korean bbq place have that orange sauce its so addictive its spicy sweet and tangy all at the same time its great. Honorable mention on their honey mustard sauce. But yeah overall food is great many options me and fam always get the same stuff brisket , beefbelly , porkbelly , galbi , and baby octopus. (Gotta try their Military Rice lit!)"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Delicious all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue for a decent price. The cheaper tier offers more than enough options for most people, and all of it is delicious. This place gets pretty smoky but it makes for a really neat atmosphere. Service is great. Definitely plan on going back."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"All you can eat for cheap. All kinds of meat is served pork, beef and ribs. I don't eat meat but my friends enjoyed it so much. I didn't go hungry they had loads of mushroom, cucumber and the vegetarian bowl which was so good. Strive for variety 😉 …"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great Cafe, but the wifi was incredibly slow. The place was pretty full of people working which may have been the cause of the slow WiFi, but ended up having to leave because we were unable to get much work done"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Good Food!!! Good Service!!! Very FUN place!!  Very Very reasonable PRICE!!! Highly recomand with large group!!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,This review is for the cafe next to the restaurant. The cafe is tucked into the building and very easy to overlook. I highly recommend this adorable little cafe! The cafe itself is simply adorable with all the quirky little decorations. The staff is so nice and definitely contribute to the atmosphere. The coffee there is amazing and always fresh. You won't be disappointed!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,What a great KBBQ. We must have been here for 3 hours eating their amazing food. Lovely staff. Would go again in a heartbeat.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,the service was pretty dismal. the place is so cute and quaint but the customer service was extremely unfriendly and over priced. what a shame. 75 cent milk...seriously.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"First time here- I like the drinks, and it's a good place to get work done. However, one of the staff members was fairly rude and impatient. It ruined an otherwise good experience."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Fantastic BBQ, a nice long 2 hour limit, great drinks, spicy...but good spicy.   And shoes are optional."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This place is amazing. The food was great, my partner and I walked there and needed to get a Lyft back because we were so full."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Bad place. Came here for lunch on a Saturday and there were a bunch of open tables. Service was awful. The server dumped my entire first order of meat on the grill without asking. Had to ask for water three times before getting it halfway through my meal. The galbi is mediocre and you only get one small serving of it in the AYCE. Don’t come here.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,me and a friend recently came here and had a wonderful experience! Food was awesome and Cindy was a great server! She was very helpful and we had a great time!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Love the YaqiniQ, my wife and I have been coming here for years. We don't go for ""speedy service"", if that's what you want to to Starbucks down the street.  This place has character in spades and it's nice to have suchs a good atmosphere to sit on a sunday, have spam masubi and a cappuccino, or get out of the house and do some writing and maybe treat yourself to a cookie too!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"we went around 5.30pm and waited for 5mins, it was okay. the staff are pretty friendly, but the food was okay. the beef short rib was really very good and the garlic butter chicken and the beef brisket was okay. quite smokey and the smell will linger on your cloth."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Best dining experience ever. So fun with a group of friends! Don't wear any clothes that you don't want smelling of Korean BBQ. You've been warned.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Nice usually quiet cafe with great desserts (yuzu & matcha pound cakes are especially delicious). Not a ton of outlets but still a great spot to read or study.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"If I were the owner, I definitely would focus on cleaning."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Decent food but they rush you if you show up towards the end of night. They cut us off at 10:20 when they close at 11pm. We were seated at 10:09. Not cool.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,A long wait if you don't get early. The pork belly is delicious and they have a pretty good sized menu. Not as good as Gen. Ken but still good !
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great all you can eat KBBQ on the cheap, they put a limit on galbi orders though. Expect a long wait if you come during the dinner rush or anytime on the weekends."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Marinated pork rib much better than expected, of course the short rib is real good tho only one order per person but overall great kbbq ayce"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Cute cafe with tasty drinks and food
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Huge selection, good bundle pricing, quick to watch and replace the hot plates when needed. Great staff and food."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,The food is very delicious. The service is also very good
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Everything is great about this place. The atmosphere, the people, and definitely the service. You will not leave happy. My only complaint would be that they leave the door open and it can get freezing cold at times. But I understand its for ventilation since its a gigantic BBQ in there. But regardless of the door open, the smoke still congests the area and can get a little bothersome but I understand that it is part of the eating experience of Korean BBQ."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"I would give this place 0⃣⭐️star if I could.  It was my first time here and my friend has been there few times. We got here at 5:30p and only couple tables occupied. Food served so fast and the servers helped pour the meat on the grilled for us as if they were rushing us out the door. During the 1.5hrs there, the servers came by many times and asked if we were done eating?!  The first order is big and second order on meat portion is smaller and poorer meat quality. By the time we left, only half the restaurants was occupied. I will not recommend this place and I will not go back for poor service and poor qualify meat ! 👎🏻"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Wait is about 30 minutes for dinner service. Food is excellent quality. Price is competitive for the quality, service, and cost. Only complaint would be how tightly packed the tables are, this causes the restaurant to be quite noisy/loud."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Their meat is fresh... Ish... Not straight from the butcher fresh but juicy enough to taste the difference... It's a self bbq place so if something becomes dry and jerky like then don't blame the place...  It's your cooking skills... 21.99 for basic menu...
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great tasting food. It is all you can eat and there are two menu options you can choose from. One 21.99 per person and 26.99 per person. Already great choices on the cheaper menu. You cook for yourself(most fun part) and they have free side dishes(typical for Korean restaurants). You are also able to order other dishes like steamed egg and rice.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,My sister kept burning everything..lol ....but the food was great for price. And the service was fantastic.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Food was delicious. Very, very crowded. Definitely need to make a reservation."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Nice place if you need Korean BBQ!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Best all you can korean bbq I’ve had so far! There’s even a cute cafe below that you can wait in since sometimes the wait can be long. But food is amazing quality and definitely a gem of SF
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Excellent service and reasonably priced for lunch.  The marinated pork rib and steamed egg was exceptional.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Lots meat choice, awesome food, long wait, and strange service."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Value for money is great - excellent food, helpful service and a guaranteed good evening"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Full range menu on meats and seafood selection, may need better ventilation, be prepared to walk out with strong food smell, good dining place overall for quantity lover"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Good value for AYCE Korean BBQ, but the service was a little chaotic because it was quite busy and there was one large group. Had to ask more than once for some items. Ventilation is poor so it gets very smoky."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Awesome experience! They fry up the meat right on the table. Korean wine is a must. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. There's a call button at each table and servers come instantly.  Don't wear nice clothes, you'll stink after."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Fantastic Korean BBQ, great for big parties! Just make sure you make reservations far in advance!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Service was good but they limit short rib to 1 per person.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Pricy but good food. Wish the waiters did not rush us while we were still eating.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Really nice ambiance, decent wifi - can get a little spotty when it's crowded; good mix and space for people to study, meet and/or lounge. Solid coffee spot in Japantown"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,One of the best in the city and you cant beat the price. Just $21.99 for dinner. Closest to LA level kbbq.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great Food always a fun time ...be ready to eat
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great selection in the all you can eat bbq, with two price levels (we opted for the more basic one). The gal-bi was best, the unmarinated pork belly was plain. Efficient and friendly service! Be warned, it’s very smoky inside and you will come out smelling like kbbq. Not vegetarian friendly."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Cook your own, all you can eat! Great experience!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great Korean BBQ at a good price. A reliable place to meet up, eat and drink with friends."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Very good all-you-can-eat restaurant. Very local Korean favor!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The food was excellent. $22 a person. $10 for my three year old,  and free for my one year old. I especially enjoyed the butter garlic chicken. I did not like the spicy chicken. This would be a five star if they had changing stations in their bathrooms. The bathrooms were dirty and had no area to change diapers."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Excellent service, great food, some staff could be friendlier"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great Korean BBQ!!!  First time in San Francisco and if we ever come back, we will definitely go back."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Fantastic for the price which can't be beat in San Francisco. We do an outing at least once a year here with the company and always have a blast enjoying the BBQ and soju. The Kalbi in particular is some of the best I have had.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"good, tasty but pricey"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Hours says 9:30pm closing time we were there at 9:15 and they said they can not take us, If thats the case mention on your goddammn website that you stop taking customers after 9 and closes at 9:30 🤦‍♂️ Trash"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"cute seating and menu, but tiny/not the most comfortable tables and chairs. very limited plugs for those looking for extended stay to study/work"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"One of the best Korean BBQ in San Francisco, great taste, great service equals to great meals.  Keep in mind that since YakiniQ it's quite popular you might have to wait to be seated but the wait worth it."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,An interesting experience. Good marinated pork!! Not too expensive.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Waaaaaaaay better than the San Jose location!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"A wonderful cafe in Japantown: hot drinks, boardgames, a light quite space with plenty of room, and late hours. Just perfect for study, work, or just poring over a book!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This place is great, but check your bill before you pay. Also, wear clothes that you want to smell like smoke!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Pros: Good tea selection, power outlets, open decently early and late, chill vibe, art, decor, onigiri, location.  Cons: Bathroom smell drifts in once in a while and it's nasty. Slow wifi."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"All you can eat meat, you grill it yourself and every type of meat I have gotten was delicious"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The place I found Korean bbq. My first love. Honestly. It's pretty cheap for being what it is, but expensive if you're not used to spending $30+tip. Not all the sides are free. Keep that in mind. But it's so so so delicious. If you are reading this, please please have a bowl of rice with the spicy bacon for my wife and I. 😁 ENJOY! …"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Fun spot for all you can eat Korean Bbq. Some of the meat appeared frozen, but it was still tasty. Loved the spicy pork belly. Great sides, good prices, solid service. Arrived shortly after it opened for the day, so there was no wait. The downfall--disgusting bathrooms."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,One word: bulgogi. I will not go to a different Korean BBQ place because this place is superior to all!! Get there right when they open or be prepared to wait while salivating over the amazing smells emenating from each booth.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This place is a cafe and a BBQ joint. The cafe is open during the day, so don't let the Google Maps times fool you.  It's a nice quiet cafè with decent food and wifi to really get some nice time to yourself or get some work done. The interior is nice, spacious, and cozy."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great price for quality of meat and service provided. Unlimited food, but will charge for leftovers. Bean paste and miso soup not available/included in banchan (small dishes served with rice and meal). Recommend calling ahead on weekends/peak hours."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Long waiting time, be sure to make a reservation. Unlimited Korean barbecue, you have 2 hours to eat all you can (except the best meats that are limited to two per table). The meats are good enough, but I've had a lot better."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"too crowded and not clean. staff is very impatient. compared to other places, there are way more options"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great little café in Japantown. Lots better than its older brother Korean BBQ restaurant - it offers a wide variety of seating options and is popular for those wanting to meet for lunch or work on a project. They have great teas and snacks, and you could get away with some lunch here. I recommend the Spam musubi with yuzu tea. Outlets are available but the internet connection is a bit strained by the amount of customers there streaming Youtube videos."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Delicious meat belly was had. Friendly staff, reasonable prices."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Meat quality is just okay but if you like meet buffet, $20 is reasonable price to give it a try. Expect wait."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Yummy place for Korean BBQ!! A variety of banchan, drinks and food to order for bbq. Be prepared wait in line of you don't have a reservation. Located in heart of Japan town."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Came in at around 9pm to put our name on the list, told us we are the last party and that the wait would be at least 30 min. We went down the street to wait since they said they would call us, which we thought was pretty cool. They call us around 10, and we arrive right away. They seated us in two separate booths, so our party was split up, even though they had big tables where we could sit together, but they just sat us where they could. We did the $21 all you can eat, but as we were ordering they failed to tell us the sides were extra cost to one group, and with the other group who asked if it was extra, they acted like we were dumb for asking. After our first round of food, they tell us last call on our second round 30 mins before closing time, even though we should have had fill service until their 11pm closing time. They also refused to let one group order more than 3 items for our last call, which now doesn't make this all you can eat. No more meat, no more sides. Not once did they offer to clean our grill. 10 mins after last call they bring us the bill, and rush us to pay. Gratuity was included in our bill for their RUDE SERVICE.  Go somewhere else unless you want BAD service"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Decent price indeed, but it’s nothing compared to other yakiniku places I’ve been to (in Japan). We mostly got served frozen meat, which wasn’t very tender."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Delicious! First time having Korean BBQ and I had an amazing experience. Food was delicious and the staff was very nice.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Meh. If I want to eat myself into a human trash can, this is the place. Unlimited meat.  I like their dipping sauce, though. There isn’t much “sophistication” for your snooty foodie."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,This restaurant should also provide bowling games. One of the waiter is just so good at throwing food on the table!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,An amazing food experience. Great for ANY moment
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Food great, service great, decor needs an upgrade"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"i absolutely loved their cafe. its super nice and it reminds me of the cafes in Korea. unfortunately if you are a laptop camper, this place is not really for you. they have limited plugs for you to charge your laptop. The drinks are good, must try the sweet potato latte."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Fantastic. Best value for your money, plus it's fun and delicious!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Absolutely delicious food, completely reminded me of living in Korea. Soju and Makali were reasonably priced and worked their wonders. I shall be frequenting this establishment consistently."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Great quality food, friendly staff, I highly recommend! All you can eat! Bring your appetite!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"It’s a pretty fairly priced for all-you-can-eat, but the meat is not very flavorful. Sometimes the music can be bananas loud. Service is fairly fast. Not fantastic kbbq but also not bad."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Doesn't feel clean. I was fine when I went in and ate something that made me vomit my whole dinner out.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great atmosphere and amazing service.  Quality food!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Usually I wouldn't bother giving a bad review. But we had such a terrible experience I feel obligated to do this. The staff service was very unfriendly, and not very helpful with helping us understand the menu. Also they brought us food we didnt even order at one point, but the kicker was what happened at the end of the meal. So me and some friends and family went to this place. However I had recently ate minutes before we arrived so I had only planned on drinking and entertaining our guest. However towards the end I did have 2 bights to try something I had never tested. (to see if I would like it and maybe come back). But the manager (or maybe owner) saw this and tried charging me a full meal. Keep in mind that it is an all you can eat type of place so paying around 27$ for 2 bights of food is insane. We tried to explain the situation but the man refused to listen. Not only that but he was very rude to us and very dismissive which is what bothered us most. We ended up paying, but we gave a bad tip and of course we will never go back there again."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Amazingly delicious. Super fast service. Love.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I was passing by that BBQ while strolling through the Japanese quarter. Usually they do not allow a table for just one person but made an exception as it was not too crowded that evening. Food is very good you get for 22 or 26$ a variety of meat choices you can grill at your table. Beef brisket was one of my favorites but chicken or fish are available and very good as well
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great food for a great price but very very busy!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Food and service are okay not great
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Okay was told a 20 min wait ended up being a 45 min wait. I Love FOOD, how ever this was very low on my scale of good. We had to wait for everything, had to ask 2 times for rice, soda, and meats. Out of all Korean places I've been too I would never go back."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"They took my reservation, I drove 45 minutes to restaurant, turns out it's closed. I tried going yesterday Jan 2. I called at 5pm when they open, and a man picked up my phone and hurriedly tried to take my reservation, and didn't even bother to ask for my name. After giving him my name, he confirmed my reservation for 8:30pm. I drove 45 min from San Jose to meet a friend for dinner and how shocked and embarassed I was when the restaurant was closed. Terrible terrible service, would not recommend. The food is decent but there's plenty of kbbq to choose from in town."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Favorite Korean BBQ spot in the city! All you can eat for $20 for delicious food and great service!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I like Korean BBQ so much! And this place is the best!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Finally I found an all you can Korean BBQ for a good price in SF and it opens late too!Winner!!! Came here late, at around 10:30 and we waited for about 20-25 min. The place was packed even so late at night. Lots of big groups there.  The food was actually quite good, the beef brisket, marinated pork, spicy squid and beef intestine were great! The complimentary sides were good not a big variety , but the kimchi was great!  We had 3 waiters come to our table, one was a little rude and trying to rush us but the other two were great, always smiling and helping us. Thank God the rude one only passed by once. The other two were very friendly.  The price is the highlight of the evening $19.99 a person is a catch! The place definitely needs some serious ventilation renovation and some dusting behind the tv that's placed next to the staircase. The women's toilet needs a lot more attention though! It would have given it four stars even it was cleaner, because the food is good"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Christy who owns this place has great selEct scones and custom baked good from her  own recipes. Check out the Yuzu tea and sweet potato latte.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,First of all. Servers speak no korean at a korean restaurant. And beef brisket tasted like a jerky... dont think im ever going back
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"All you can eat Korean BBQ. Period. When you come here, you have to remember two things: First, make sure to have enough room in your stomach to fully appreciate the meal. Second, you will get the meat sweats. But it's totally worth it."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,this is suppose to be an ALL YOU CAN EAT kbbq. I was in the middle of eating and the waiter told me that I can only get one more dish and immediately gave me the check when I didn't even ask for it yet.  On top of that one of the waiter was rude.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Make sure your order is correct . Lots to eat.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Wonderful barbeque and worth the wait. Love the steamed egg.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Coziest coffee shop I've found in the city!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"A bit small and rowdy, but the service is always prompt and their owners have mastered the craft of kbbq. My favorite is the galbi!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Great service and great food my friend's and I drive almost 2 hours and to us it's worth it every time we eat there.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Kinda disappointed with the AYCE.... the air quality is so stuffy in here. But the staff is pretty friendly.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The food was tasty. Place was loud and crowded and full of smoke. Somehow some of our cash mysteriously disappeared between when we gave it to the waiter and the cash register so we had to argue over how much cash we paid, so that was sketchy. Ok place for lots of meat with the guys. Not a good date or family spot."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"If you're up for an entertaining time with tasty food and cold beer, this is the place. Can be on the loud side, but the food makes up for it."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Good for the price. TIPS: ●They won't seat incomplete parties. ●Water has to be requested. ●There is a button on the wall to ask for service. ●You can ask for more sides, too."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"As close to an authentic Korean barbecue joint as I've found - down to letting you cook your own food at the table, which is rare in the States."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Awesome selection! Spicy things are proper spicy. Great service switches out the grillplate frequently to avoid burning food and smoke accumulation. Miso pork belly is the best.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Hands down best Korean BBQ in San Francisco. Be prepared for up to 2 hours wait. But worth every second of the wait.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Expect a very long wait to get in. Dont bring a large group, takes a while to cook the food so everyone will be very hungry."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Expensive! Requires vaccination card And very smoky But the meet super delicious and the way we are able to grill it is very cool
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Best place I have ever had Korean BBQ!  I've been here with a large group of coworkers and the employees were very accommodating. Even as are table became more and more intoxicated. I even took my parents here because I liked it so much!  The food is great and tastes fresh too.  I do recommend making reservations in advance if you go at dinner time. It's nearly impossible to get in even if you have just 2 people. The max limit is 2 hours but, that's plenty of time to eat all you can eat!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Horrific. Blaring EDM, servers wont/cant hear you - throw up all over the bathroom."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,All you can eat for just $20! Tastes just like in Korea. So good!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Delicious.nice and helpful staff, and they play kpop videos!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,AWFUL SERVICE FROM THE PERSON WHO RECEIVED I WAS ONLY ASKING ABOUT A TABLE AND VERY RUDELY ANSWERED NO AND IF I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IT WAS FULL
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Long wait, but it was worth it"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,awsome prices for foods. Try korean BBQ styke here
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Quite possibly the only all you can eat Korean BBQ in the area
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Love to to there when you want to eat a lot meat
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,If you are a meat or Korean food fan; this is your place. Come and feast. Just don't get your tummy to explode.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Decent place to satisfy your KBBQ crave on a cold day in SF, variety of meat choices, and quick service."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Best Korean BBQ in SF in a convenient location. I highly recommend over walk-ins.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,I went for all-you-can-eat and was pleased to find a couple tiers both with a great selection of meats and reasonable prices.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Food is OK. Not a lot of choices on the menu. Staff was not very attentive.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Food was great, wait time was long though. Make sure you have something to do while you wait."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Oh my gosh, i can live on the beef belly and the spicy octopus from this place. Come here with an empty stomach to make the most of the experience."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,All you can eat goodness. Try bulgogi beef
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"This review is for the cafe: good selection of food, wifi, and a few outlets.  Very popular - can be hard to find a seat."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Like the environment. Spicy pork belly was nice and the prime ribs are on top! Just the bees tongue didn't meet my expectations.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Good latte and the environment. And the stuff is friendly. I'm only a little confused on why water is charged by 1 dollar.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,food is disgusting it got me sick found a small curly hair in the meat when brought to us my friends also got sick and host were rude dont come here
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Best KBBQ ever!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Busy yakiniku place. Lots of fun and pretty good meat too.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Korean BBQ with nice marinated meat and top ups for Panchan. Would recommend!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"I went with a group of 5, and it was a pretty quick wait tine for a monday night. The meat was great and a selection of the basic meats  for all you can eat was $21. There did seem to be some sort of limit of how many orders you can get, but in our case, it was just enough for all of us to be completely stuffed. I wished that they had flavored soju cocktails by the pitcher, but that would have been a nice extra. Overall, this is a pretty good kbbq place thats cheaper than Gen and has good quality meat for a cheaper price"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,Absolutely delicious!
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Really like both the coffee shop and BBQ.  Beef Brisket and Beef rib fingers?! Yes please! Staff is great. Only downside is the wait,  especially on Friday & Saturday night.  Oh and if you sit on one of the stools in the middle,  remember the top of the stool can come off and put your jacket in there to minimize it smelling like BBQ for the rest of the night."
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Meat is not super high quality. Atmosphere is fun, and most of the staff is friends and helpful!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,solid all you can eat food at a reasonable price
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"The dipping sauces were great, friendly staff, great late night atmosphere!"
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,One of the best kbbq places you can have in SF.
YakiniQ CAFE,1640 Post St 1st floor,"Friendly service, good food variaty"
