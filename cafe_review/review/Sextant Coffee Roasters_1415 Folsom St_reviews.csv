Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Tried a mocha along with an almond croissant it tasted good. They have a nice selection of pastries! The ambience is perfect for a quick catch up with a friend, to work, or to unwind with a book! The outdoor area is great! There's street parking available."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"One of the best espressos I've had in the City and probably anywhere, actually. I had the Maiden Voyage Yirgacheffe, which was rich and unique with its heavy berry and floral notes. I also bought the Black Lion to take home and turns out I like it even more. Definitely give this place a try if you enjoy coffee and want to spoil yourself with something different."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Solid coffee with great gluten free pastries!  I recently hosted an event and I bought a large container of coffee. Their service was super fast and they had it ready in 15 min.  They have a variety of Asian flavored desserts as well as the usually croissants and cookies. They also have a few gluten free options, I recommend the banana walnut cookie"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Hard to get good coffee in SF, and this place is no exception. Don't come here if you want light roast delight. Sextant Roasters knows a good deal about coffee, but not the folks who serve the brew here. It was a challenge to get tasting notes. They only offer one medium roast as espresso… and that one turned out to be bitter… Milk alternatives are normally here - but not today. They ran out.. too bad. the backyard is nice though. Overall... Don't bother to come."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Spacious coffee shop with your standard load out of coffee/espresso drinks. I had the drip coffee, which today was the Connoisseur blend. It was served at perfect drinking temperature (I feel like typically places will serve it hotter than drinkable).  Connoisseur - blend from columbian beans. Had sour notes+aftertaste and a bit zesty. Slightest hint of cherry. Did not taste the apple or honey cocoa as suggested in the flavor profile."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Great quality of third-wave roaster and coffee shop directly working with farmers across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Colombia. My favorite coffee here are Americano and Cappuccino. Their pastries from local shops are really good too."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Really good coffee and probably one of the best Kouign-amann I never tried . The only downside of this coffee place is that they don’t have outlet near the seating area
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Very unique roasting and tastes very good.  I believe it's because their source of the bean with onsite roast makes the coffee fresh.  They also have a back yard area for customers to sit and enjoy their coffee.  Their cold brew is a must to try.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"This coffee shop will receive my five-star rating. Everything went smoothly and without any issues. They always gave it their all and have a high level of customer satisfaction. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend this location! Thank you all so much for your generous assistance. Excellent work!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Recently moved to the neighborhood and stopped by this place after hearing good things. I can say it lives up to its good reputation. The cold brew was one of the best I’ve had in the city and Amber & Isobel were super friendly and welcoming.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"My favorite cafe in the neighborhood, and possibly in the city as well.  Love the light-filled space and the brick walls, but I think the best part is the patio in the back.  Very friendly staff, and what tops the experience?  They give out **amazing** 🐶 treats 🐾"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Despite the grey exterior, this is a relaxing spot with earthy vibes inside. Great place to sit down and do some work. Good coffee and croissant too."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Brilliant independent coffee roastery in San Francisco - worth the hype! I had heard good things about Sextant and it definitely lived up to expectations.  Great range of brewing methods,  delicious Ethiopian pour-over, and really helpful and knowledgeable staff."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"One of the best coffee roasters and coffee shops in the SoMa area of SF. They have not just good coffee, but GREAT coffee here! It’s a lovely space inside and out, with a nice quiet garden area out the back with a few tables and benches. Staff are friendly and helpful. There’s a good selection of coffees and other merch, which is well designed and reasonably priced."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"I think I might have gone on an unusually bad day based on the other reviews. We think that the machine or something was not clean or properly working. 3/4 people in our group, took one drink and threw it away….the 4th person is just to stubborn to throw away food or drink. We each had different drinks from espresso to drip, mocha and latte so we think it was fundamental with the beans going through the machine.  I ordered a mocha and I think the barista forgot to add chocolate? If that’s possible.  Anyway, we had to write a review because it was as bad as it can get. From expense to not a human taking our order to no descriptions of the items in the case, no cream or sugar stand, and they were out of brown sugar. All that being said, we would have forgotten all of that if at first sip, we were “ahhed” and satisfied. It wasn’t even drinkable….we dropped them at the first trash can and went to 711 and drove home.  The employees today did seem very nice and were helpful us with our questions and desires for brown sugar. They apologized for that.  The presentation was good, the guy poured it and it looked cool but it just tasted so terrible.  4 hungover people about to drive back to San Jose and we threw the coffee out! Do you know how bad it has to be for that to happen!?  $14 for quad shot espresso."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Vertical coffee at its best. This is a Black owned business. The owner has relationships with coffee farmers in Ethiopia and roasts his beans fresh in the back. Sometimes if a particular bean isn’t available up front you can ask if they have any in the back that haven’t been bagged yet. They charge extra to use a credit card so if you buy beans pay with cash to save a buck. I love the low acidity and smoothness of The Windsor, but Maiden Voyage is great for espresso. Their website is frustrating because it says pick up in person is possible but it doesn’t always allow it, and if you want subscription there’s no way to have it be picked up rather than shipped."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,I ordered a mocha and the barista accidently forgot the chocolate. It was super busy or the barista had a lot on their mind—all of which are valid.  I told the barista and they quickly made me one w chocolate. Ace customer service if you ask me.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"This was always my favorite hidden SOMA gem, and after getting to know the owner Kinani, it is now my go-to spot for beans in the city as well. He's a passionate first generation Ethiopian who truly knows his stuff, if you want to geek out on 🫘.  Other pluses: big beautiful space that always smells like coffee (they roast on site,) a relatively quiet back patio (for SOMA), and my favorite perk: a free trip coffee when you buy a bag of beans ;)  Wishing Kinani all the best"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Come here and get the Wired Gandhi (dirty chai) because it is to die for! We love that this coffee shop is dog-friendly and has WiFi and tables for working. The baristas are always so friendly and sometimes give Calli treats!  We’ve tried an almond croissant, peanut butter chocolate cookie, and a blueberry scone (my favorite of the three being the scone) and they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  Will definitely be coming back here again and again!! Highly recommend"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Super cute cafe, friendly staff and good cappuccino. Although it's not my ultimate favourite coffee in SF it's pretty good. (Everyone has different tastes so it's never comparing apples to apples) Coffee well made and milk was steamed well for a cappuccino."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Amazing, light-soaked interior - brick walls and wooden ceiling. You sit next to the roasting machine. Very friendly staff. Delicious coffee. An inspiring founder story (see their website).  Ample space to sit and strong wifi, so this feels like a good place to get some work done. Note that there are no power outlets though.  For breakfast, they have some pastries but not otherwise much food selection."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Possibly the best espresso I have ever had.  There aren't many coffee places that I would go out of the way to visit, but this is definitely one of them.  Just amazing."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"The most expensive pour over i have ever had. It was yirgacheffe and ok. It didn't blew my mind. It had to for a $10+ coffee with tip. Nice open area, great to work/study/chat."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Very nice cafe ambiance. Very good coffee - if you like unflavored lattes, this place will not disappoint you. Good pastries. Friendly and good baristas. Music can get a little loud."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Coffee room temperature, turkey sandwich was a ham croissant and cold in the center, coffee steamed to end up being ambient temperature within zero seconds. The piece of cake ended up being a corner store muffin.  First place award to recommend looting when the fabric of society unravels goes to ...... One word to describe service: piddliwink."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Very mediocre and disappointing. The coffee was fine, but nothing special for a $8 price tag (with 20% default tip) and below average service. The barista was very aloof and mildly unfriendly and so as the guy grinding coffee who seemed to be a manager. The outdoor patio is nice but the place itself is pretty small and not as vibey as it looks in the pictures. Nothing to come back to."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Very nice ambiance, good coffee, vegan cookies, bizarrely amazing bathroom. Also, has a balcony and is great for laptopwork."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Highly recommend! Scrumptious baked goods, artisanal coffee, and a great place to sit and enjoy it all."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,They sold me 6 month expired seeped coffee and when I pointed it out they told me that the expiration date was only a suggestion and it was still good. I was really disappointed as I enjoy getting coffee from here but their reaction was unacceptable. If they think this is ok then what else are they doing behind the scenes to cut corners at the expense of the quality. The guy told me that the coffee is actually good for one year and the expiration date is actually a suggestion. Stay away from here if you want quality products.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Beautifully decorated with super delicious iced coffee made by amazing barista Isobel
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Wow, I'm blown away. I ordered an americano and now I can safely say that this cafe KNOWS espresso. Some places will give you something very sour or astringent, but this was heaven. They used their Maiden Voyage beans and frankly I think it was the best americano I've ever had. The barista was great and he answered some questions I had. The atmosphere is very inviting. Also, they roast their beans right in the back of the shop. I can't wait to go back!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Lovely coffee shop! This place has it all, friendly staff, lovely interior, a nice outdoor patio, and most importantly, delicious coffee. Highly recommended!."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"I love coming here in the mornings, their team is genuine and kind and the coffee is great. I love the calm interior and sweet patio too. Lots of healthy snack options, rather than just pastries. But really I come back for the people. The owner always remembers me and makes time to chat"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Good coffee and a nice brick-lined space to enjoy it. The staff is also friendly and efficient, and the place has a great atmosphere as well as wifi to get a little work done if you need to."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Great experience. The guys working were really helpful and really friendly. The “Da G.O.A.T.” beans are fantastic - we took some back to Boston with us.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,A Truly amazing cup of Ethiopian coffee in such a beautiful environment with some of the most sincere and friendly staff that makes me want to come back every single day with a welcoming and warm environment. I really love calling this place a second home / office
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Cozy spot with delicious in house coffee and friendly staff. Wish there is bigger choice of pastries and sweets.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Excellent pour overs, in-house Probat coffee roaster. Cozy atmosphere and fair price for both a cup of coffee and beans!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"At the San Francisco Coffee Festival today. The Sextant Coffee people were rude and condescending. They give me a sample that wouldn't be enough for a 2 year old. Asked for a tiny drop of cream, guy puts about 3 ounces in my micro sample. Gives me a super sarcastic phoney apology. Are they trying to sell coffee or annoy people? Based on this experience I won't even bother setting foot in Sextant Coffee Shop."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"This coffee shop will receive my five-star rating. Everything went smoothly and without any issues. They always gave it their all and have a high level of customer satisfaction. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend this location! Thank you all so much for your generous assistance. Excellent work!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"- such a cute cafe with great drinks - got the flat white (my usual order) and it was a solid cup of coffee, no latte art though - got one of the pastries, it was decent but forgettable"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Lovely spot with good in house coffee, friendly staff, plenty of seating and a cool patio."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"The café has a nice area atmosphere and very neutral, calming decor."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Very cool spot with amazing coffee, fast service, and during Wi-Fi. pretty quiet space, a little dark, but a good place to work. Didn't look for outlets so I don't know about that. I had an Americano and it was flavourful but not aggressive in flavor."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Their coffee quality is amazing. However, there are a few things which have me conflicted about rating the business higher. 1. The cost of a fairly small cup of joe will go about $7 or so. Kinda steep. 2. They open late weekdays (usually 8am; more below). 3. Sometimes they don’t open on time and customers are waiting outside. If you open at 8am you should actually open at 8am.  When I come for coffee I have it planned during my workday, and when you don’t open on time it really sucks. I have had to leave without getting coffee sometimes due to this issue."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Semi-regular now at Sextant Coffee, but it’s really hit-or-miss quality. Quality beans and roasting. But ~50% of time I get burnt or scolding hot milk, and bitter/ poor quality espresso. Real shame.  Nice warehouse-style interiors + wifi if you’re looking for a spot to sit with a coffee or do some work."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"This place makes a great 8oz cap. One of my favorites in San Francisco! Highly recommended, its got a cute space as well.  If you are coming up to it northbound on Folsom, it's easy to miss!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Really well pulled cortado/Gibraltar - barista did a fantastic job getting the milk temp right. Awesome fruity bean made for a heavenly start to Sunday.  The decor/vibe is also great. Def a favorite of mine
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Best coffee in folsom district
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"I like this place but they make you place your own order on a tablet, like McDonalds. It's not quite as annoying as I thought it would be, but it sort of creates an awkward gap between the customer and the server. Do I talk to them? Hard to say. It also makes me want to tip less because I feel like I'm doing work I used to not have to. I wish they would go back to the way it used to be."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"I have tasted many coffees and visited my fair share of Cafes around the world. This one is one of the best! absolute perfection! place is modern, very clean and casual. very comfortable atmosphere. Staff is extremely knowledgeable and very skilled. the coffee is to kill for. Highly recommend!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Most delicious coffee in San Francisco by far. Excellent!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Pour over is muddy and $9. Worst 3rd wave coffee in sf
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"I drink a lot of coffee, unfortunately I have never come across a latte with such a strange taste. including the excessive price. I will not return…  I also just read the comments of the owner here and it sounds like someone without respect for customers who doesn't take responsibility for mistakes, an excellent recipe for a failed business."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Delicious latte and mocha. A bit on the pricey end, but quality of the coffee is there."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Delicious espresso, Yirgacheffe coffee"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,The coffee is great and the pretzel sticky buns are killer!  The shop manager runs a good crew.  I highly recommend this coffee shop if ever your in the area.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,I'll definitely be back. Sextant has delicious coffee with an excellent fruity almost citrusy tang. Friendly service at the counter and nice tables and space to hang out or work.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Very friendly staff. We could smell the coffee before entering the place. No outlets to plug your computer tho, so if your planning to do some work, be sure to have your computer charged. This is also a great place to read your favorite book."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Not bad coffee. Maybe a bit weak. Nice environment and lots of seating.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Very good coffee & pain chocolat, also had a brief chat with the owner."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Excellent coffee and delicious pastries.  Friendly and professional staff.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Great industrial space with fresh roasted coffee. Simple coffee menu. Great iced tea.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,They charge an extra dollar for any cream in your coffee. This is the only coffee shop in the city I've ever been to that charges for cream
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Latte was ok. I’m reviewing the whole experience. It’s not personal as you order on a kiosk screen. The bathroom here is awful. It tries to be techy, but it is so annoying to flush, dispense soap and wash your hands."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Kenani adamant that his coffee is the best anywhere. On two occasions I tasted a distinct charcoal, burned taste in the Yirgacheff. I mentioned it the first time, however the second time I returned to coffee for another batch. He is very defensive about his coffee. He was accusing me of something being wrong with my taste. The replacemnet batch is okay. However, I will not return to his shop."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"If I could post a 0 star review , I would. I came here once and was hoping to use their WiFi which I had called to confirm that they offered earlier . They said they had wi fi so I made my way over. Once I got there , I charged my laptop at an available outlet and was rudely told by an employee that I couldn’t use it and they asked me to unplug while I was on my laptop doing a meeting. I abruptly closed my laptop and ran down the street to find another place to work. Sextant is awful and what is wrong with SF coffee shops ."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"OMG..  their ICED MOCHA 😍 Do you like dark chocolate? Do you like good quality coffee? Do you like great service from nice people? Then duh - head straight here! I really can't recommend the mocha enough - we also really like the pizza danish. We love having this coffee shop in the neighborhood and we really commend the the courage, grit and resilience of the owner to continue operating during difficult times such as now (with Covid, vandalism and lack of support for small businesses)."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,The shop roast in house with an open toaster that allows bean developing fresh and smooth taste with wonderful nose. This is the finest coffee you will find in the city if you want to feel the taste rather than burn.  Always excellent pull and great pastries. Love it!
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"It's just a lovely place to have a java. This place really deserved better than five-star stars. All from their employees, interior designers and even facilities was excellent. A spot to keep going back to more and more every time. I strongly recommend this coffee shop to all of you."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Delicious coffee and amazing staff.  This local coffee shop has been my favorite place to safely pick up coffee during the pandemic. I really appreciate the contactless ordering and payment options.  The staff is very helpful and the coffee is delicious as always. I highly recommend the Iced Wired Gandhi.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"They have everything that you need! I highly recommend this shop to all of my friends and family who enjoy coffee as well. Yesterday, I came here and I was so pleased and happy with the overall service. You guys deserve an award indeed! Thanks, guys, for your kindness! Cheers for your accomplishment! The coffee shop is highly recommended!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,Lovely neighborhood coffee spot. Old school brick building.
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Top of the line equipment - Black Eagle, Nuova Simoneli. Directly sourced Ethiopian beans. Kinani is humble, passionate about his craft, and cares deeply about his product. I'll definitely be back for more."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Best place in the city to find quality, fresh-roasted Ethiopian coffees. Friendly staff is always helping me tweak my coffee recipe. Definitely recommend for someone looking to get into specialty coffee. The Maiden Voyage roast is my personal favorite. It has a sweetness to it that I have yet to find anywhere else in SF."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"I have to say these guys are a step-around, as I have witnessed the team members. Good to be around and unpretentious. It's a small shop that grows organically through good service, hard work, and delicious coffee. As well as the Pistachio croissant, the flavor of the Espresso was excellent. We will soon be coming back here again!"
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"Smoothest, most delicious iced Americano I have ever had. If only I weren’t an hour away! Inviting brick interior as well."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"if you're looking for smooth espresso drinks, a couple of delicious light-roast pour overs or tasty pastries, this is the spot. the atmosphere is solid and there is a good amount of seating. the staff have always been friendly with me and their positive attitude shines through in their work. the yirgacheffe pour over is worth the wait."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"GREAT service. These are nice people who make a great cup of coffee. It may not be dirt cheap, but the atmosphere is nice and you know what, they care about your experience. They are very friendly. The coffee tastes good and the people make me want to come back. I'll glady pay an extra buck for a latte if it means the people look like they're enjoying themselves and happy that you are there. Thanks Sextant, I'll be returning."
Sextant Coffee Roasters,1415 Folsom St,"The Cappuccino or the Flat White or the Quick drip coffee or the Wired Gandhi paired with the chocolate croissant – pure joy! It doesn’t really matter what you get, its all excellent. Sextant is definitely one of my all time favorite coffee roasters in San Francisco."
