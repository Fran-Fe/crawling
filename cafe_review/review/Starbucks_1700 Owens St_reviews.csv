Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"The facility is cozy with a fairly ambient atmosphere ideal for a good quiet place to work and study, or simply charge your phone at the wireless charging station while you sip your coffee."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"Deceiving ... all the outlets have no power!  Brand new Starbucks great location across Kaiser Permanente, service is not great; people behind the counter are not knowledgeable and borderline rude.  Cold brew coffee here is very weak and not up to the usual Starbucks quality.  Thank goodness the egg bites are still good! Only one restroom, it is not well-kept.  Expect a line to order, this place is bustling as there is not much places near here to have coffee and tables while you wait for appointment at Kaiser."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"I like that they open at 5 am. Store is clean this early in the morning. The staff were nice and polite. No lines and got my order right away.  Edit 5 months later: Jolene and Curtis know my order by now. Again, great staff and service."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,This place doesn’t have fancy space but every staff is very professional and accurate. Sarah is especially nice!
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,The whole staff is wonderful. They are so kind and humble especially Curtis. He always remember everyone's face and order. He is remarkable. We need someone like him in every Starbucks. I wish all the starbucks had a staff like one on Owens...great energy! God bless them all.  Today I didn't see Curtis nor the middle eastern girl who are shooting kind. Today I didn't like the energy of the staff. Bring them 2 back
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"Well maintained store, awesome staff. I don't usually come here often, but it's nice to stop by before or after a doctor's appointment if you're in quick need of some caffeine or a small snack. 😊"
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,Says it’s a drive through but it’s not. Suggest you take that off.
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"This place is awesome, staff are very friendly, they know yr name just after a few visits. They know yr drink and food preferences off top. It's a sexy kinda place to sit around and feel cozy. Sip coffee or read, study, or just come for the fun staff. This place is close to my job too. I look forward to going by there everyday. I have the app too it's great to see what's new to drink or eat. Stop by you wont be disappointed by the ambience and friendly staff.  Sip and Relax.🤗🤗"
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"The staff is on point! Fast, friendly, efficient. Location is great, safe from Karen mobiles that don't care to look before exiting the Starbucks drive thru, as there is no drive thru here."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"I love Starbucks. However, this location has absolutely not access by car and no parking is available nearby. You can't even pull over for 5 minutes to run in and grab a pick up order. Only order here if you are in walking distance."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,Really clean store. Nice employees.  I love the outdoor seating due to the chairs having back support. I used my 400 star reward and got a free coffee mug today.  It's small but air conditioned.
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"This is my go-to Starbucks as it's so close to my work.  I'm usually in and out because they're really fast fulfilling my mobile orders, and I really appreciate that.  I knocked off a star because their coffee (and I get the grande dark roast everytime)is NOT hot.  I thought it was because I made the mistake of ordering my coffee early (through the app).  So I adjusted my ordering next time and submitted it when I was already walking, and it's about a 3 minute walk from my office.  It's still the same result. I just don't get it."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,I don’t know how they manage to mess up my order 3 days in a row but they do. They are more interested in chit chatting than helping the customer. Unsweetened black tea should not be a hard concept but it really is at this location. Wrong size and or sweetener 3 days in a row. Also messed up a food order.
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"Just an idea but when the line is heading out the door and the customer in front is paying with change (and I mean pennies) you may want to open the second register, especially during lunch time. Clearly there's enough staff because only two out of the 5 are actually doing anything. Try it. You might see a spike in revenue because potential customers may stop walking out. Merely a thought."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"I always enjoy stopping by here for a quick Java fix before heading in for my appointment just down the block. It's generally quiet with plenty of outside seatings, and the staff is always awesome! 😊👍 …"
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,The women who called out the  orders was very rude I asked her if that drink was my drink and she was like well isn't that what you ordered and she just walked away rolling her eyes at me. I don't recommend this if you are in a hurry or if you get easily triggered by someone being rude.
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"It is what you would expect at most Starbucks. The baristas are quite friendly, and it is close to work. The facility is cozy with a fairly ambient atmosphere ideal for a good quiet place to work and study, or simply charge your phone at the wireless charging station while you sip your coffee."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"This is a very nice, large, spacious, clean Starbucks. Very convenient to UCSF medical center and Kaiser. You might miss it if you're not looking closely because it's between two Office Buildings."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"The person behind the counter taking orders was slow and surly.  The half and half container was empty and when I brought it to the barista to have it refilled she acted like she'd never seen the container or heard of milk before.  After simply asking to have the carafe refilled I literally had to explain that I needed the empty container labeled ""half and half"" refilled because it was empty.  Then I went back to the milk/sugar area and neither of the two napkin dispensers had any napkins in them. I then had to wait for a different slowpoke behind the counter to shuffle off and bring me napkins.  This place wasn't busy - practically empty.  Bad Starbucks!!!"
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"This locale appears to be a busier Starbucks than the nearby stores at 16th & Kansas Streets and at Townsend & 8th Streets, probably because of its strategic location on the Mission Bay Campus of UCSF. Of course, this was at 9:30am and the Google frequency indicator concurs that this store is usually ""pretty busy"" at this hour. And so it was.  I had submitted my order on the Starbucks app only 2 minutes before arriving and didn't expect my handcrafted espresso drink would be ready so soon. I'm glad I asked after waiting 3 minutes and not hearing my name called. My mocha macchiato, still piping hot, had actually been awaiting my arrival at the mobile order pickup counter. Very efficient service, I'd say, despite the large number of customers! Lesson learned: Be sure to ask about your mobile order as soon as you arrive here."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"Came here to catch up on some work on laptop. Initially, I wanted to sit inside Poke life next door, but it was too cramp. I never like Starbucks, but didn't want to feel like a freeloader, I ordered iced coffee just to have the appearance being a customer. Barista show no interest with their job and chitchat with coworkers about their up and coming weekend. Nothing to it, it's a Starbucks."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"Convenient location near Kaiser's Mission Bay facility. Friendly staff. Usually enough seating. No comfy armchairs, just tables and chairs, a bar with tall stools, and a few outdoor tables."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,Nice place so kind people Thank you for your service!
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,Better than the STARBUCKS ON 16th st In the City.  Owens STARBUCKS HAD RAW (NOT WATERED DOWN COLD BREW.  STAR BUCKS IS Or supposed to be a coffee shop.NOT A PLACE THAT SALES soda pop and Twinkies Cakes
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,Customer service varies: some of the baristas can't handle the volume of the store. Then I end up with a caramel Americano without caramel. Again.
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"A little slow.... I have done mobile orders several times and my drink isn't ready when I get there several minutes after the time span it gives you, and no one was in line or waiting."
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,Nice indoor and outdoor seating. Good selection of sandwiches and snacks. Large selection of drinks. Price Is affordable.
Starbucks,1700 Owens St,"Friendly staff, and they always make the best tasting drinks."
