San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Great spot for a quick bite or a remote work sesh.  Atmosphere: urban retro warehouse vibes, plenty of 2-/3-top tables, a few tables outside in front and on back patio.  Workable: yes- 6/10. Not too noisy, but not super quiet either. Small tables great for solo work. Moderate number of outlets.  Food/Drink: in addition to the classic coffee/tea- breakfast/lunch sandwiches, bakery items, & seasonal drinks. Forager Breakfast Burrito was yum✔️  Price: mid-range? Didn’t try their drinks so can’t speak there, but the burrito was worth it.  Parking: free lot across the street"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Work and friends take me to many coffee shops in Atlanta and so I was here on a stormy Friday morning recently. The whole vine was warm and welcoming and the two rooms make it more cozy. ***More coffee places need to offer affordable specials like this.***  I was not a huge fan of the spinach ricotta quiche thus only 4* on the food because it lacked much taste. Next time will choose a different one.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"loved working here today! everyone was super friendly, the back corner was perfect to zone in. very laid back, casual environment with really yummy coffee. get there early to get a spot by an outlet!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I've always liked coming here. The staff is friendly, drinks are tasty, WiFi works, and the vibe is perfect for just a out anything. Last time I came a man made inappropriate comments towards me and the employee at the counter was stood up for me instead of letting it pass or pretending he didn't hear. Will forever be my favorite neighborhood coffee shop."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Just a wonderful environment. Since the moment I walked in, I knew I could get some of my morning work done here. The staff are wonderful. I had a sandwich, I believe it was something with turkey sausage and tasted really good.. took me about an hour or more to eat all of it because I didn't want the taste to escape. Also, if you're in the mood for that wake me up dark roast, highly recommended. I enjoyed getting work done at this venue, and I will certainly revisit. Just an FYI, Lisa is a gem"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Went for the first time yesterday and the barista was welcoming and so personable. Got a large, iced maple latte and it didn't disappoint. Definitely has all the workings to be a favorite neighborhood coffeehouse with some strong work-away-from-home vibes."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Solid second-wave coffee. Very dark and over extracted, but not super flavorful besides bitter."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I've been here a couple times now and it's always a great experience. Their espresso tastes great, and both hot lattes I've gotten had lovely latte art on them. This visit, I got a recommendation from the barista for a vanilla lavender latte and it was incredible. The breakfast sandwich I had was also tasty, and I was especially impressed with the quality of the bacon. To top it off, the atmosphere was great, although it can be difficult to find a seat sometimes.  This shop is on the pricey side, but that's pretty typical for a local coffee shop in this area. I've also found that their wifi can be a bit spotty. Overall though, a great visit!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Owning my own eye care practice, customer service is paramount to the overall experience. In fact, my practice was built on it, and has thrived over the years because of it. I’m often surprised at the lack of customer svc and bad attitudes of the personnel in coffee shops, and wonder if it’s due to apathy, poor hiring practices or the manager’s disposition. In contrast, San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company is a rare gem, where without exception, the team is warm and friendly and make patrons feel at ease and at home. The experience is so consistent that I was compelled to pull aside and compliment the manager, Lisa, on the contrast here versus other coffee shop options. She’s intentional about who she hires and it’s obvious she only keeps those that are aligned with high customer service values on board. So far I’ve met John, Olivia, Kyle and others that have demonstrated excellence, and I couldn’t be happier I’ve found my spot to work, connect and sip delicious coffee and enjoy yummy vittles!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Man working there with glasses was EXTREMELY rude! I asked a few questions about a drink and he shut me down then made fun of me. He said it was too much work to make a coffee I didn’t know about.  He then got snippy with the staff working the cash register. He is the definition of a coffee snob. Awful service from him about something not that deep! I suggest going down the road to another coffee shop.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Very nice atmosphere. Great for reading, working or just having a good coffee with friends! There id parking across the street and a lot of other things to do within walking distance. Absolutely worth a visit in ATL!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Good stuff. Long wait for simple latte -- and grinds in the bottom of the cup -- but I think it's just from ramping up again and personnel shortages. Cozy and popular in the neighborhood. I'll try again another time.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The atmosphere is very nice with music playing in the background and generally a small crowd of people working or chatting. The coffee is pretty good, the espresso is a little more bitter than I prefer but was still very good, the coffee cake was also excellent and has a nice oat crumb covering which is an interesting texture to add to a generally more plain dish. San Francisco is definitely worth going to if your in the Highlands, there is plenty of parking behind the building, the line stays very short, and the baristas are very nice and efficient."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The cold brew was great, the atmosphere is so friendly and peaceful, and there's plenty of parking in the back. Also got to chat with the owners Doug and Tanya while I was there and they were wonderful as well.  I stopped in when I was in Atlanta for a conference and will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,I recently visited San Francisco Coffee and I was very pleased with my experience. The coffee was amazing and I could tell that it was locally owned. The atmosphere was really nice and there were plenty of seating options. They also had specialty coffee drinks that were really good. The service was polite and the prices were good. I definitely recommend San Francisco Coffee.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Always the best coffee in Atlanta! Please, please open a store in or near Brookhaven. It will stay packed!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"A lot of parking directly across the street and some street parking. A bench outdoors and two European styled small patio table and chairs. When I went, all the indoor dining was closed."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"My new favorite Atlanta coffee shop! Love the decor inside, and my ice latte was great :)"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Coffee here is okay. Service is terrible. They screwed up our order (2 coffees) and took 15 minutes to bring us microwaved slices of coffee cake on what was clearly a slow day.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Great coffee. Great breakfast food. Great service. Comfortable atmosphere. Great for neighbors and visitors.  :-)
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Great coffee shop. Their deserts are wonderful! I love the atmosphere because it's quiet and small but not too small. You can study peacefully if you want or you can have a nice conversation with a friend without worrying about being too loud. The owner is very friendly and the staff is pleasant to deal with.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Cozy, quiet coffee shop serving great coffee and lattes! I personally like the local fresh juices available as well for a nice detox. The bakery items aren't bad either! 🍰 …"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Good coffee and a reasonable number of power outlets.  7/2023 EDIT: The music and staffing has improved tremendously in the last year. The current staff are uber friendly, and the music much more conducive to *my* ability to concentrate & relax. Opinions will vary of course."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"This used to be San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company. I had a cappuccino that was pretty good. Their Nutella croissant is bad - it’s heavy and doughy, so it shouldn’t even be called a croissant and it tastes like chocolate syrup, not Nutella."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I love this coffee shop!  Great coffee options, plenty of seats, and great staff!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,They know my name. They don’t mind how long I stay. Friendly staff. Good music. Not too loud. Peter
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,One of the best coffee places in Atlanta!! We love their Mexican chocolate coffee and cold brews. Plus the baristas are the best.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Pleasant & Friendly Staff - I’m new Candler Park area as a resident. I’m also a coffee lover and finding San Fran is a major highlight. Atmosphere is tranquil with an urban vibe- Coffee lovers you won’t be disappointed
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Walking in here on a grey rainy day, getting a nice cup of coffee from friendly servers in a stylish, cozy environment instantly lifted my mood."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Delicious and healthy breakfast selection. Staff friendly and accommodating. Very popular spot so be ready to wait for a table.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Nice atmosphere, quaint and great staff. Food and coffee is a little pricey but expected considering the area it is in."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"In my opinion, one of the best coffee shops in Atlanta.The staff is consistently friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the coffee is very good. The Mexican mocha is the best mocha you can get inside the perimeter."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,I ventured into town for a coffee meeting. Excellent cup of coffee! Cute coffee shop feel. I'd go more often if I lived close.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,My favorite coffee in the Atlanta area that I’ve had so far.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Nice atmosphere to sit and work, but waaay overpriced and staff isn't always friendly. Especially frustrating was a recent interaction where I had paid $14 for 2 cups of coffee; I asked about throw-away pastries as I was paying since they were closing on the hour. I was told they would know when they closed at the end of the hour...There was a mountain of day-old pastries sitting right there that was surely going to go in the trash after I left, but God forbid a customer get away with a throw-away bagel or cookie. So lame."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Great coffee roasters with delicious on premise baked goods and food! Good coffee house vibe.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The best coffee shop by far- the coffee is freshly roasted! The food is delicious, and the team members working there are so warm and friendly!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Coffee is bad, and I promise there are better places to get coffee on your way to work. Try academy, Bellwood, perc, aurora instead to name a few. Support workers, not San Francisco."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,The lady at the register who took our order was so mean and was not happy that we were there. It was our first time and will be the last.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,I Originally got a bag of Sumatra coffee from them and it smelled and tasted like a bag of Dunkin donut so I went back and and they gave me a new bag and a gift card I came back for a third time to use the gift card and ordered 4 coffees and 3 breakfast sandwiches for a whopping 65 dollars my mother asked for no goat cheese And cheddar instead. she got a mouth full of goat cheese in the forager burrito. 2/4 coffees tasted burnt and sour and the bacon on the other two sandwiches had burnt bacon on it. The only good stuff we got was the banana nut bread and the chicken salad that was already packaged.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The coffee beans are excellent! Baristas are very nice and their banana bread is very good too. The atmosphere is very laid back--great for some Saturday morning reading, and there's a bike parking spot right outside."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Really nice and cozy coffee shop on Virginia Highland. I’ll fashioned interior, great selection of coffee to buy. Prices are regular and the personnel is very friendly. Find a minute to get there and have a cup of aromatic morning coffee!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,A top 3 coffee shop in Atlanta for me. Absolutely love coming here. The outlet situation could be a lot better though. So come charged up.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Great little coffee shop with excellent coffee, tea, pastries and sandwiches. Calm, comfortable atmosphere. Really good staff. It was easy to have a conversation there with no intrusion from loud music. Parking across the street was very helpful, although some street parking is available too. Hidden gem, glad I found it!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"A great vibe for reading, working, and conversation. Price is slightly more than you’d expect"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Love this place, been going for years. Remodel really opens up the space and makes it feel bigger. Still has lots of character and great drinks"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Great place to grab coffee! The atmosphere is nice and peaceful and the place offers indoor and outdoor seating. Loved the hot chocolate and would recommend the cookies!
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Very good! Just came in for a small drip coffee. Tasty stuff. Staff were all friendly and masked. Place was clean. Back patio was nice and quiet. Definitely worth a shot!
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"YUUUUMMM, my go to order is a vanilla lavender Iced latte and the ham and cheese croissant.  The staff is super awesome and very accommodating! The vibe in the coffee shop is awesome and I am always super productive there!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Love this cozy cafe to work or meet friends for coffee. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but their drinks taste great to me. Plenty of parking in the back, there's always a fun playlist on, and a nice homey vibe to the place that somewhere like Starbucks lacks. Also has a covered back patio. Definitely fills up during weekdays."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I love this coffee shop!  Their hot coffee drinks are incredible. My favorite, salty bee latte with almond milk very light on the honey.  Their breakfast sandwiches are great as are their premade quiches, ham and cheese croissants and cinnamon knots!  Service is always friendly."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Always a favorite of ours.  Tons of options, high quality baked goods, and one of the few places in the neighborhood that offers gluten-free options.  Our family will always be loyal customers."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,My experience wasn't a very good one. I waited in line with about 10 people in front of me to finally get to order and then they tell me my cash is no good there. You know they should have had a big sign on the door. I wouldn't have bothered standing in that line for 30 minutes. But I have to say to their credit they did give me a free coffee not the mocha I wanted but you know it was kind of them.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Latte good, cortado was very bitter:( But pecan pie was GREAT!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"This is my favorite Atlanta coffee shop due to the area, atmosphere, and consistent experience I get. It's generally a bit busy, but there's always somewhere to sit. The coffee is always fresh, the staff always attentive, and the crowd is generally good-tempered and diverse. If I had to knock off a few pts, their pastries and sandwiches aren't anything special and the tables aren't comfortable so I'm always looking to move to a cushioned chair. If you love VaHi and kicking back at a relaxed coffee shop, this is it."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Just started coming here again after my commute changed and I get to bike past here most mornings. It's got a great weekday morning scene with a mix of people: workers stopping in to get coffee to go, school kids getting hot chocolate on their way to school, and people settled in for a while with their laptops. Service is quick and I like that they encourage you to bring your own mug/thermos. Coffee and breakfast sandwiches are very good."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Love this coffee shop.  I've been coming for years and it's always warm and welcoming.  The lack of outlets can be annoying if you're attempting to work on your laptop but the food and coffee always hits the spot.  They make a great espresso and tonic drink for those hot summer days.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Long time local classic with locally roasted beans serving quiet retreat away from the Highland bustle.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"This store, my fav coffee shop, needs to PLEASE re-open some dine in tables- not all- just a few or at least their outdoor patio in the back. And I dislike the Card only shopping because I like using my cash for small purchases or treats like coffee. The help have always been friendly and welcoming, but no more.  What’s up with that. Just plain mean and not at all nice/ Covid fear! Get over it. Wear the masks, wash your hands, (Oh but no restroom to wash up!) social  distance.  Play nice! And safe."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Their coffee is good but I find it astonishingly rude to verbally ask a customer if they’d like to leave a tip.  ESPECIALLY for handing me a $3 cup of black coffee.  This seems to be the norm here and not just a single incidence of a rude employee as several different baristas have done this to me now, so clearly management has instructed them to verbally ASK for tips.  I’ll going elsewhere for coffee whenever possible solely because of this."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Good place to work. Lots of tables and outlets. A little dark though.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Mostly go to this neighborhood coffee shop for it's whole-bean, in-house roasted coffees (especially the Old Whaler's Blend).  It's also a great meeting place (especially on Spring and Fall morning when they can open up the store to the outside).  On a few occasions I've had their sandwiches and breakfast items - all were excellent.  Unlike many in town establishments, there's plenty of parking behind the store, or across the street."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The coffee is better than Starbucks on average. The staff is meh and the ambiance is...well there isn't any..very old place, uncomfortable chairs, but the mugs they serve in are perfect. For a cup of Coffee - yes, for anything else; checking emails, meeting friends,etc.- no....parking sucks."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Walked in with my dog because there was no sign indicating “no pets allowed”. Honestly just wanted a quick to go black coffee, but they wouldn’t even let me order, let alone wait outside with my dog to pick up my drink. Went to PERC just down the street, much nicer and cooperative"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Good food chill atmosphere.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Unpleasant coffee served by unpleasant people.  I purchased two shots of espresso, and as I was paying, I asked where the restrooms were.  I was told brusquely and dismissively by the person at the register that they weren't providing restrooms for customers.  He then immediately followed this statement up by asking how much I wanted to tip him.  I told him no additional tip.  His response was, ""Yeah okay.  We use that money to feed our families, but sure you just do whatever.""  As for the espresso itself, it was watery and overheated.  It might work in a drink with milk and syrup, but by itself it wasn't good.  I've been to quite a few great coffee shops in Atlanta.  This was not one of them."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I like the vibe, I like the consistency, I like the location, and I find myself returning constantly. The taste of their coffee is perhaps a little too strong for my taste wich at times can make the coffee taste a little more dense and a bit burned. Though I'm not a light or sweet coffee drinker, I do prefer a smoother aftertaste to my espresso. Would recommend this place to someone who likes a more smoky flavor to coffee."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Whenever I'm in a new area I seek out the local coffee roasters. Some places want to be coffee roasters, but don't know what they're doing. The pour over I decided on at San Francisco Coffee Roasting was delicious. A knowledgeable staff that was willing to help me out. Skip Starbucks and find this place if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I really like this place.  It has good vibes and is a great spot to sit down and do some work, catch up with friends, or just swing in for a quick cup of your favorite coffee beverage.  The cold brew spritzer is my favorite (cold brew, seltzer, and a fresh lemon slice)."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I'm a regular, have been for years. Sadly, the coffee sometimes tastes dirty.  Probably those big vats need cleaning. With so many great coffeehouses intown, hard to stay number one. But the cafe ambiance is very fine here. Great place to read, write and work online if you can find an outlet. The wifi is jumpy. Opens early. Another one farther south if you don't mind a long walk or a short ride on the. # 16 Marta bus."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Easily one of my favorite places in Atlanta. Any time I’m looking to treat myself in the mornings I stop in for a quiche and some coffee. Everyone is super nice and we’ve never had an issue there. Love it!
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Pretty good coffee and atmosphere (not too quiet; not too crowded). The food items are overpriced for what they are, but the coffee selection is fantastic. There's even a free parking lot behind the building so you won't have to lug 50 lbs worth of books to go study."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"They have great selection coffee ☕! The atmosphere is great especially if you sit at the bar in front the window. However, I had to remove one star because the service is a bit lacking. To be fair,  the service is generally good but some employees are a bit...  Unfriendly."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Pretty lazy employees the last couple of times I've been. Last time I went the employee was texting and did not notice me walk up. When I got his attention he appeared unhappy to have been bothered. They had no cream of any kind out and I had to ask for it. The restroom has been dirty and smelly every time I've gone. The most recent time both trashcans were overflowing. The drip coffee's really good though. Outlet situation is OK but a little subpar.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"BEWARE: DECEPTIVE, DECEITFUL, FRAUDULENT PRACTICE  CAUTION to customers of San Francisco Coffee Roasting Co: The 1lb bags of coffee that you think you are buying are really only 12oz. They do not state this on their website, on the bag or tell you in person when you ask for one/two/three (however many) pounds of coffee. Instead of being transparent and honest when you ask for a certain amount, they just grab their pre-filled bags which weigh 12 oz. They DO NOT tell you you are really paying far more per pound than you think you are paying. The have their advertised price but do not indicate that the price is for 12oz, not the full 16oz that is the industry standard, which is exactly why they are doing it, and how they are getting away with it. Nobody expects the bags to be filled with less than 1lb. You think you are paying $14/lb when you are really handing over $18/lb. They would rather fool and cheat their customers for extra income, than be a fair and honest organization. I wonder, how do the faithful long-time customers feel about being fooled and taken advantage in this way for so long? I wrote an email complaining to them and did not even receive a response. No shame. Slimy tactics, fraudulent practice! The icing on the top? Mediocre coffee. Why would anybody continue to go to this shop? There are better roasters/shops in the area who appreciate and value their customers."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"This would easily be one of the top coffee shops for me except for one thing. The lack of outlets! There are some but don’t come expecting to get one. Other than that the coffee is good, lots of parking (there a free lot, always a plus) and it has a great quiet cozy vibe."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"SF coffee is a great place to work, read, or hang out. It has an array of specialty coffee drinks - I've only tried the special espresso blend but it was delicious. Their brewed coffee and regular latte is excellent."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"This is a great place to meet a friend for a catch up, or an associate for a meeting.  Solid baristas, friendly staff, good lite bites. It's a good size place, but so popular that sometimes still tough to find a seat."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,SF Coffee is a quaint but busseling shop that is now my favorite breakfast destination. The menu is limited but the atmosphere is a gem. Coffee selection is very good but could also benefit by more variety or at least a rotation to include new selections
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Love this cute laid back coffee shop. Their mochas are always top notch, and there is a good breakfast/snack selection."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,The atmosphere was great and it was crowded on a Saturday morning. They have a good variety of coffees on drip or pour over. The food looked good but I didn't get any. They roast on location so it was very fresh.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Good coffee, I can recommend the flat white"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,My favorite coffee shop to WFH! I go once a week:) love the iced lavender latte
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"I live in the neighborhood and have been here several times.  I stopped going a couple of years ago because some of the employees are not very friendly (you get the feeling that they would rather be somewhere else), and they allow those with gift cards to cut in line, which is especially irritating when the line is long in the morning.  I may try it again to see if anything has improved."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The Highland Ave.  location is a great place to hang out while savoring some really good ""jo"" with a sandwich or pastry. Plenty of convenient free parking. Also easily accessible via MARTA #816 & #36 if you live in the hood and don't want to drive there. Nice eclectic clientel."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,My favorite!! Get the iced coffee with cream and caramel and the sour cream and blueberry muffin!
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Incredibly good coffee coupled with delicious pastries and a warm vibe make this a fantAstic place to settle in for a morning and chat or commune with one’s laptop. Good WI-FI too. Way way better than the neighboring Alon’s.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,FANTASTIC! Better than that green logo place by miles!
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"No response to “Hey how are you” or my $1.00 tip for a small coffee, or the two times I said thank you after paying, thinking maybe she didn’t hear me the first time. Back to making my own coffee in the morning."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,The staff has changed since the last time I was in. Much better. More customer oriented. First time I've been able to find Costa Rican Tarrazu in a while but I believe that's because the owner is discerning about where the beans come from. The way they're roasted makes all the difference in the world and they know what they're doing. Better than burnt beans from Starbucks anytime.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Great little coffee shop with very local feel (even for a chain). Real furniture and cozy vibe. Whe. Weather is good they open the huge bay window on the side. Normal coffee shop prices but they have a $1 refil on regular coffee self serve.
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Stumbled on this place after going to the post office next door. I went on a Saturday morning, so it was crowded, but the coffee and breakfast sandwiches are reasonably priced and well worth a small wait. It's a great place with a lot more seating than i expected."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"The black coffee here is good, other than that his place is a time-waster. We ordered a piece of quiche and a plain bagel, toasted, with butter and cream cheese, to go. We waited 15 minutes. It was ridiculous. When the kitchen help finally brought out the bagel, he said, ""bagel with butter""... I asked, ""it's got cream cheese, right?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah, I think the ticket did say that."" So, he took it back and another 3 minutes went by. He brought it back and I asked about my quiche, which the front clerk was warming in the microwave ... apparently he had forgotten about it. I think the owner got a new piece of quiche for me because I had watched another dude throw out a quiche container. It really reached the point of being comical. The quiche was mediocre. The bagel was soggy from too much butter."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Absolutely, hands down my favorite coffee and tasty treat spot in Atlanta. It was San Francisco, but is the same great spot. Pre pandemic this was my second home. My usual Mexican Mocha and hammie sandwich as a solid choice if you need an idea of what to get! Their cookies, breads, pastries,and lunch items are all delicious. You really can't make a back choice here.  Love you guys!"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,Great coffee.  I bought a stash of Ground to go as I paid 15 bucks for a large mocha and breakfast sandwich.   I found the price outrageous but it's the Highlands everything is.  So I'll be making my coffee at home and making infrequent visits lol
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"A great stop after USPS or DBA, San Francisco Roasting Co. is a small coffee house with friendly staff, cakes and pastries, and good coffee. They even have their own roasts. Try the Cake in a Cup coffee, it's really good."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Came in the other morning and had a barista that kept calling me baby and sweetie and hun, it made me super uncomfortable... was hoping the almond milk latte I ordered would make up for the very unsettling greeting but it didn’t.. the milk was burnt and separated almost immediately. Whomever this gentleman was needs to focus more on making his drinks and less on trying to flirt with customers. And on top of everything a  female with dark hair rolled her eyes at me when I asked what alternate milks they offered. Overall, I will not be returning."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Not only is the quality of their drinks to notch,  but the staff and customers were friendly.  I love it here. We were evacuees from Hurricane Irma this wknd and this was a bright spot to our day.  I wish I could move here."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"My go-to coffee spot in the Highlands. Best bacon, egg and cheese in Atlanta. Consistently meets expectations and has a very laid-back environment. Highly recommended."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Nice little place with a good atmosphere. However I have 2 complaints. 1, the wifi isn't great and it disconnects every so often. 2, they messed up my order. I ordered an everything bagel and egg salad. After waiting a little bit, the guy called out ""everything bagel with egg salad and wasabi."" Wasabi?! Where did that come from? Thought I may have heard wrong and nobody else came up to pick up the order so I went ahead and ate it. Would've been delicious if not for the random wasabi. Really ruined the taste for me. Why would I want wasabi. Those words never came out of my mouth. Ugh."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Good selections in drinks and have a good choice of baked goods,  I don't like that they charged more than 3.25 for a glass of milk that is almond and soy 1/2 &1/2"
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Cool place, but prices are insane. Legit SF prices. Paid 11.85 for a very mediocre breakfast sandwich. Probably won’t return."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Brother and I have gone separately for 20+ years.  Consistent service, with some good small food items. Fits well with the atmosphere & architectural look of the 85-120+ year old neighborhood."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"Anand and I here at #AtlCoffeeScene have finally made the full circuit to all three branches of San Francisco Coffee Company - Ponce, Morningside, and Candler Park. We had such mixed reactions after going to the Candler Park and Ponce locations that we felt it would only be fair to go ahead and hit up the third location to be the decider. Here we will break it down the review down for you, location by location, to offer up a comprehensive view of this Atlanta Coffee Co.  Ponce: Located near the corner of N Highland and Ponce, this San Francisco branch has a pretty nice seat, and is walking distance from both the Highlands and Inman Park, as well as everything on Ponce itself. However, that's about the only good offered by this particular shop. Much like Aurora, the atmosphere here is one of ""constant renovation."" A bad assortment of chairs and tables, and a lack of upholstery and decor, makes for an uncomfortable location.  Candler Park: Seated on Dekalb Ave. it catches commuters in the morning and does a good job of getting people through the line and out the door fast. I appreciate this. That very detail is what converted me to Starbucks versus a local spot many years ago. Anyways, the cafe is large, comfortable, and clean, and the employees are nice and hard working. I came solo to study and as I sank into a big comfy chair (near a fireplace was it?) I instantly relaxed and got made some headway on a challenging reading. A dependable cafe is needed in that part of town so San Francisco in this location works well. Sure, across from Candler Park would have been cuter and maybe more popular, but there's already Dr. Bombay's, which as you already know is dominating in that area.  Morningside: We visited this location third, hoping to make it a tie-breaker. But the oddest thing happened. Jaclyn had described her Candler Park outing to me, and we were both still familiar with the Ponce location. This ended up being a right down the middle of both of those. We went on a Saturday morning, and it was CROWDED. Families were coming in from every direction, having just finished their morning walks. The main coffee machine was broken, so the drink selection was limited. But the pastries were good, the service was on par, and the general ambiance was cozy and comfortable."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"A coffee place with character! The coffee guy had his own approach to giving you his brew, bound to make you laugh. A lot of worknomads and an atmosphere of networking. Great place to do some work on writing."
San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,"SF Coffee has been a go to for 15yrs or more. Each location is well run, clean and consistent. Giving four stars due to crowded space b/c of merchandise displays."

San Francisco Coffee Roasting Company,1192 North Highland Avenue Northeast,I'm coming here regularly again. I stopped quite a while back when they stopped making their egg salad spread.
