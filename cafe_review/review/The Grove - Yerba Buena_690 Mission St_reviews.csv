The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Beautiful unique restaurant with absolutely delicious food. Everything we tried was amazing and fresh. Can't say enough about this place! Love ,love, loved it! Dead Head weekend brought a tremendous amount of people here with not only great taste in music, but food as well."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Friendly service and nice atmosphere but food was a big disappointment. My $18 breakfast burrito was soggy and flavorless. GF’s Benedict came out cold, with untoasted English muffin, and also strangely lacking in flavor. The only thing we liked was the orange juice ($8).  Expected much better, especially for these prices ($72 for two, w/out tip)."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Came here on vacation.  Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Seating inside and outside. Busy but fast service.  Food and Drinks were good.  Only complaint I would have is the price is a little high for the food.  Good but expensive
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was good but not amazing. Egg Benedict arrived cold ! The Greek salad was far from being Greek. Barely feta cheese was added, the only “vegetables” in this salad were the spinach and 4 tiny slices of orange. Overall it was nice to eat , but next time we will definitely go somewhere else."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We loved everything about our meal here. The atmosphere is casual, comfy and yet rich and inviting. The high ceilings, wood features, leather and fireplaces all combined to create a wonderful environment.  We ordered two pot pies that were as delicious as they were beautiful.  The salad had such minimal dressing that you could barely taste it but after requesting some more dressing, the salad was delicious.  We will definitely be back!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food is good for the price you paid, but the service isn't quite there. The atmosphere is casual, and it gets pretty noisy when it's crowded, which is often the case because of the price point for their central SF location. So just know what you are getting before you go, so you won't be disappointed. It is a decently good place if you just want to grab a quick bite and go. But don't expect this to be a sit down place where you'll be pampered."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is a casual and simple restaurant with standard American fast food and drinks. The restaurant is very differently decorated, and depending on your taste, you might find it nice. There is no table service here - you must order everything at the counter, where you will get a flagpole number to bring to the table. The man at the door explained the process and gave us menus upon entering the restaurant. You have to order the food and drinks and then find a table, but the drinks are given to you at the counter where you order. The tables and chairs are sturdy but rather dirty. We had to ask for new glasses twice as they were incredibly dirty.  The staff is friendly, except the man at the door, but you really only interact with them while ordering. We found the process impersonal and gave the dining experience a sense of being at a truck stop rather than a restaurant.  We ordered sandwiches, chicken wings, and burgers as the main courses are only available after 4pm. The food was delivered to our table reasonably fast.  The food tasted fine, but was nothing special. There are tons of better restaurants in the area and we will not be coming back. That said, if you want a quick bite and don‘t care so much about the ambience and the quality of the food, this restaurant is fine. Or if you just want to have a drink.  Ambience: 2/5 Staff: 3/5 Food: 2/5 Price/quality: 2/5 (pricey for this quality)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place was busy - both inside and outside nad saw that as a great sign…and yes! we didn’t get disappointed. We stood in line and ordered and wow the food came so fast! Almost immediately after sat down - and food was really good (we came for breakfast) we had a healthy bowl, eggs benedict which came with potatoes and avocado and french toast (huge portions!) Super friendly staff as well, def worth mentioning !"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place was just awesome! Food is delicious and quite fast for being so busy.  That brownie has to be the best I've ever had! It was warm, fluffy, soft, and a chocolate delight. French toast with fried chicken hit the spot!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We loved the place! We had breakfast there on July 19. Lovely place with charming music in background, not the usual monotonous drum beat. We had egg benedict and capuchino.  You stand in line to place the order. We only missed some pastries you usual get at other cafés such as croissants."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"First time here and as soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be a great experience. As soon as you walk in, you’re automatically drawn to the vibe, the ambiance of the room. The trees and the fireplace makes it a warm and cozy cabin feel. Love it!  The food was soooo good. Two of my friends ordered hamburgers which looked really tender and juicy. Another one had salad with portobello mushrooms (delicious according to my friend). And I had the French toast and fried chicken added. I wanted something sweet and savory and that did the job. The French toast was tender in the middle and had a certain crunch on the edges. I can’t tell if they added batter to the edges but it tasted extra good. The fried chicken was not only crispy but it was juicy! Loved it! The price is ok considering the amount of food you get.  Service was excellent. I accidentally left my credit card in the kiosk and it was returned to me immediately. And whatever we requested from the servers we received right away! I’d love to come back again!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Went here due to the overwhelming amount of positive reviews during a recent stay in San Fran, and was not disappointed! I got the Toasted Portobello Mushroom and Sweet Potato plate. The portion size was generous and it was delicious. You pay at the front and seat yourself so it’s not a conventional sit down restaurant but it had a really chill vibe. Would come back!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Outdoor seating. The poached eggs on gluten free avocado toast with hash browns was delicious. So good that I only felt sick from the anxiety that I might have been served real bread but 10 minutes in finally believed it was indeed gluten free bread. I’m pretty sensitive so I wished they had confirmed upon delivery. I also forgot to check if it was a dedicated toaster so I don’t know if cross contamination or stress. So if you’re really bad celiac this is probably not the place.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This place was a great find. Highly recommended. Everything was good. The fresh orange juice was amazing. A must try. My only disappointment was that I didnt try the French toast..it looked amazing as well.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Interesting place. You are handed a huge paper menu and told to order at the counter then find your own seating. There's an automatic feeling of being rushed. Staff was friendly. My husband indicated that his tomato soup was just okay. When ordering, you can see a part of the kitchen which looked messy...see my pictures and decide for yourself.  We went here to have a place to hang out until it was the hotel check-in time. It kinda had a Friends type vibe but with alcohol. We didn't try much of the food, but prices seemed high. $18 for Cobb salad."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Oh boy, let me talk about the reuben. This will give you your beef fix for about a whole month. ‘Upgraded’ the beef portion and it was certainly a thing of beauty. A big juicy pickle to celebrate after your done. Sides are nothing special.  Found the hummus to have different fixings and loved the dip options. The dip itself was fairly bland but super fresh."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,You walk to the counter to order. Sorry I'm from the Midwest... But they immediately ask for a 18-20% tip? Once you sit no one comes by to see if you're foods good .... I asked for mayo and it felt like an inconvenience for him. Hint to the wise: don't tip much. Food was good not great. I'm from Vegas so I've had more for less.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Just to echo a few of the other low reviews, when I stopped here I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were slightly overcooked, the english muffin was dry... the hashed browns were also very dry... I was pretty surprised since the decor is very nice, and there are lots of positive reviews.  I'm willing to come back again to try some of their other menu items, but it sounds like the bennys (my favorite breakfast dish! alas...) are a recurring issue for customers.  I did get their lavender lemonade, and that was very good though!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food was just ok. Paid $3.50 for a side of bacon (only 2 tiny overdone pieces) with my French toast. My husband had the quiche and enjoyed it. We didn't get our coffees until we were halfway done with our meal. My husband said his black coffee was very bitter and didn't even finish it. I had a mocha latte and it was good. The service staff was nice.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Delicious food, casual environment. Suitable for friends to meet up. The most important thing is they are open at 7:30 am, is that so nice for the early bird?😜"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This was the second time back to this place. Last time I came the food & service was great. This time I ordered Eggs Benedict. Was probably one of the worst ones I had. The English muffin was so hard that it was am effort to break it to eat. Eggs seemed somewhat undercooked. Last time I ordered the breakfast burrito & it was definitely one of the best I had.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We had the Mac and Cheese, and the Cobb Salad. Was pretty good but a little pricey for what you get. Pub style service so you order from the counter."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Amazing find..Go to the counter and order. Get a number on a stand and you can take it to a table inside or outside. Then when the food is ready, they will bring your order to you. Very quick service. Food is amazing. Great for families and kids.Good selection of classic American style fare."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great ambiance! Everything you could want in a breakfast spot. Comfortable, clean and cozy. Friendly staff and super fast service. Food was delicious and the photos tell of the ambiance. Reasonably priced as well. Great breakfast experience. 5 stars."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I love it here. You are greeted at the door with a menu, you pay and then take a seat. Great options and a gorgeous setting"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I cannot even begin to express our love for our dear friend, Abel and The Grove Yerba Buena! My husband and I take frequent trips to San Francisco, we always make time to stop in for Breakfast, Lunch, or an early Dinner. Trust me when I say that the food is incredible! We've tried most of what's on their menu, and we've loved everything! The staff is so friendly, it makes it hard to leave, and when you do leave, you are immediately looking forward to your next return. Abel always greets us with a smile and hug, the staff remembers us and is always happy to see us...as we are also happy to see them. Go to The Grove on Mission in SF. You'll be SO glad you did, and I promise there will be no regrets! Enjoy!!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"First come first serve. Order from the counter first, there's no individual table service. Food is decent. Love the gigantic fake trees. Always very crowded, there's always someone tries to help you find a table."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Such a fun place to eat, coffee was delicious! Fresh squeezed orange juice, French toast amazing."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Absolutely LOVED this spot. Super cute and local. Good food and great coffee. I went two days in a row.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Potrero Hill outpost closed, but Yerba Buena is still going strong, Home-made quiche, good coffee and pastries. And live music on a Thursday after work with King David and Chill Clinton!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The avocado toast is absolutely delicious! The environment is relaxed and you don't feel like the staff is trying to rush you out as soon as you finish your food. My husband and I loved it so much we came here twice while on vacation. Highly recommend!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Went here for a quick lunch. Sandwich was solid, and the way they served their lemonade was quirky. Overall, I really liked the vibes inside the restaurant."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I ordered eggs Benedict. It was good 👍🏼. My favorite was the fresh orange 🍊 juice! I ordered a large but I wasn't expecting such a large glass. It was a good size, great flavor, and a fair price! The staff was also super nice. The host was helpful."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Fun, relaxing atmosphere. A great place to chill over a hot drink and a good meal. We had the French toast and the breakfast burrito. They both had great flavors that were perfectly balanced. I highly recommend this restaurant."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"First of all Alejandro the manager was little rude telling us to step out from our table cuse we have to order first when preuviosly we ask someone else about it and he say previous we can sit but leiter Alejandro the manager was helping us reserving a table for us wich change entire picture we enjoy it and we Come back soon !! Thank you to all staff good food good mimosas good service !!! I'll give more stars next time when we start with better treatment the cashier Johana helped to improve our time to eat, she was excellent"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Every time I visit San Francisco I make sure I go have a meal at the Grove. Great food and drinks with absolutely zero pretentious anything. The prices are fair and the staff is friendly. The decor is just pure eye candy.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Definitely a hidden gem! Visited on vacation based on pictures and couldn’t have been happier. You order at the register then pick a seat and they deliver your meal to you. DELICIOUS. The BEST French Toast I have ever eaten. Orange juice is freshly pressed and the atmosphere is beautiful. You must visit, wish we found it out first day instead of our last because we would have gone each day!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent experience. The food was delicious, and the service was spectacular. I was treated very well by all the staff, and the host was so helpful in giving us suggestions. I recommend getting the freshly squeezed orange juice. The glass was larger than what I expected. The flavor of the food was very good."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Consistently great food made with super fresh ingredients and impeccable service. Love friendly and kind staff here!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"What a find! Go to the counter and order what you want. They will give you a number on a stand and you can take it to a table inside or outside. Then when the food is ready, they will bring your order to you. It's very casual.  Friendly staff and very quick service. Great for families and kids, especially if you have been walking all day and you just want to chill and get something to eat and drink fast.  Good selection of classic American style fare, something you can find at a diner like sandwiches, soups, salads, drinks, desserts."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This spot is an excellent choice for breakfast, lunch, and even an after work glass of wine and appetizer before heading home. The coffee is excellent and special house drinks are nice too. If you're dining alone or in a rush, it's a great option. Service is fast. Outdoor seating is a nice option on a nice day."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great for having an all American breakfast. Good start early in the morning.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This is cool sandwich restaurant to have a quick bite if you want to hang around the town. The staff was really really kind and recommended the best selling menu.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food here is DELICIOUS. The burrito was huge! Could only eat half of it. The avocado tomaste was delicious, so was the bowl. The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars, is that the burrito came with a lot of onion and tomato inside, but the menu doesn't says that, and that the seats are too small for big people. Besides that, its a great place. The service was GREAT."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Pop in first thing from a flight. Had a local beer and cheddar burger. The outdoor seating made the meal that much better. Big thanks to the servers and Julie. Also try out the Ghirardelli’s chocolate coffee. Hit the spot after that heavy meal.  Will definitely be back again soon.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I went there for breakfast and had the avocado and egg toast with the salad and it was delicious. I also had the tomato basil soup in a bowl and it was good as well. For my drink it was a cappuccino it was ok it wasn’t that great. It’s a nice chill place the line was pretty long when we got there, but don’t get scared it moves pretty fast and they give you the order quick."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The avocado toast and French toasts were delicious, some of the best brunch I’ve ever had and all of the ingredients tasted so fresh! Employees were so nice and personable, too. Atmosphere inside was great and service was so fast! Would recommend to anyone visiting San Francisco."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We visited here multiple times 10 months ago and I may very well have left a review then. I’m coming back because my husband and I still talk of The Grove often. We even talk of flying all the way back to SF just to eat there again. We were in town for Metallica’s 40th anniversary shows in 2021. We had a horrible breakfast experience for our first meal at another eatery and decided to try The Grove for lunch. We just kept going back. The food was only part of it. The staff was so friendly. The atmosphere was very quaint and quirky, which is so us. The food however, put it over the top. Everything we tried was the “best” we had ever had. We even had some cookies and cake which were also delicious. If you are in the area, do yourself a favor and go."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Surprisingly great food. The breakfast burrito was fresh tasting and full from end to end. The avocado in the filling was not skimpy, and the fresh cilantro and notably fresh chopped tomatoes on top was a flavor highlight. Seating is hard to come by and tables awkwardly situated, but for a quick and casual option, this is perfect."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Lots of options. Plenty of outdoor seating. We received a menu when we entered, but the host at the door kept interrupting us to move us to different spots in the restaurant. The food arrived at our table very quickly. It was tasty and healthy."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,the food was delicious and the restaurant had neat decor.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove used to be my all time favorite breakfast and lunch place near the SF convention district but times seem to have changed it. The menu is mostly the same but the staff seem different and the outdoor seating has expanded quite a lot (and some of the indoor seating is now closed). With a large meeting nearby The Grove was packed with a long line at lunchtime, and when I came back in the early afternoon it was easy to order and find a place to sit. My food took nearly 20 minutes to arrive and the quality was not like in the past. The French toast was coated in egg wash that gave it a scrambled egg flavor (otherwise properly cooked and good flavor) and the bacon was raw on one end and fully cooked on the other. Strawberries were ripe with great flavor and the lemonade was fresh squeezed. Still a great place to eat and very capable of returning to its prior glory."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Exactly what you want - good sit down food so you can get off the street for a few, cool interior that's not overly hip, very friendly folks working. Get the potatoes or hashbrowns or whatever- best part. Avocado toast was a very generous portion. Delicious bread. Would definitely go back."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is a good example of a self-serve cafe style restaurant trying to pretend that it's a five star upscale sit-down restaurant when it is anything but.  The prices are very high for the low quality of the food.  Anytime I've ordered eggs, of any type, there they are proudly served old and cold.  The coffee is good but that's really the only positive I can see that this place has to offer."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of the best brunch places I’ve been to! The staff are really friendly and welcoming. The service is very fast. The decor is unique - trees with fairy lights, American decs, and a light airy room. We had the large fresh orange juice, breakfast seed bowl and smashed avocado & eggs with hash brown. The breakfast seed bowl tasted brilliant and was very healthy. The avocado and eggs had excellent seasoning. All the portions were large and surpassed our expectations. We were seated and ate within 25mins on a busy Sunday morning. Highly recommend this place."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Best restaurant in the area that is fresh, tasty and sort of trendy. The beer selection is unique and you can almost always expect some surprises. The fried chicken sandwich is fantastic. We always start our morning with a large fresh squeezed OJ from here."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I had the excellent Ruben sandwich with salad and my date had the vegetarian sandwich.  Both were perfectly toasted and garnish to give a satisfying crunch yet juicy.  Service was excellent and I really enjoyed our sidewalk booth. Small but well appointed with nice plastic widows.  Nice watching the cars go by.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Had a lovely brunch here on the cute patio. Very close to MOMA. The food is very fresh and reasonably priced with good portion sizes. The hash browns are also very delicious since they have rosemary and the green sauce with my breakfast sandwich was delicious.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We took 3 breakfast dishes that we shared at 4, and it was excellent! Breakfast Burrito: tasty, spicy, greedy and BIG! Avocado And Egg Toast: Healthy, tasty and well-seasoned. Malibu Breakfast Bowl: Varied, original, healthy, delicious.  The place is very nice, and the team is very pleasant."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very bad quality egg Benedict. It was old and cold. French toast was good. Bread of Grove breakfast sandwich was not fresh either. Manager was rude thinking that we want our money back. We just wanted to give him feedback. Don’t expect fresh breakfast at The Grove.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very good food! The location is perfectly located south of Market. You can enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner. For the quality the prices are reasonable. I loved my mimosa package with Champagner and fresh orange juice."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Had a solo brunch here on Sunday and the food was great and quick! No wait at 1pm. The freshly squeezed orange juice is so good! Highly recommend this spot for breakfast / brunch
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Delicious! Lots of gluten free options, the salad i had was fresh and tasty, and I loved the outdoor seating. They know how to get a crowd through quickly - definitely worth a stop if you want fresh, healthy food near the Moscone Center."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great fun atmosphere, delicious breakfast and good drinks. 👍"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"It is a nice restaurant close to the MoMa. You order by walking up to the cashiers and they serve the food to you after. I ordered the French dip. It was appetizing and appealing. I also tried their coffee cake, however, it was a bit dry. The restaurant décor is interesting as it works in some parts but it does not in others. However, definitely a good option for breakfast or brunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Came here with two small (and rambunctious kids) just because it was in the area but was so pleasantly surprised. No kids menu but can order sides of eggs and things and the portions are big enough to share. The staff was so friendly and just genuinely pleasant and happy which I haven’t experienced in a while. The food was really great, everyone with us enjoyed what they had. The decor is super cool too and parking garage nearby the CPK. Would definitely come again if we are in the area!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Our family came for breakfast. We loved everything! We had Dave's Eggs Benedict, Avocado/egg, french toast and two eggs and bacon. We agreed the hash browns were best we'd ever had, not greasy and very flavorful. The hollandaise sauce was amazing. The avocado toast had this bright lemon taste and the french toast was the best we'd had. Drip coffee and chai were delicious too! We'll be back 😍"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great breakfast place. Orange juice, seed Bowl and chicken burger were great."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I was craving a breakfast burrito so I went on google maps to find a place close by, saw that The Grove had it so thought I would give it a shoot! I like their concept of getting into a line, order and then find a seat and they bring your food to you. The ambiance inside was lovely, there were Christmas lights and a huge tree inside, which I loved! Also there was plenty of seating. The breakfast burrito I had was okay, I wouldn’t get it next time, I thought it was kind of dry and not what I was expecting but the portion size was huge! I will go back to try another dish."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food at a reasonable price for San Francisco.  We had the Grove breakfast sandwich and their breakfast special - both were great.  The scrambled eggs were the best I ever had (maybe lots of butter).  The rosemary hashbrowns were good, but I could do with a little less rosemary.  One hint - when you arrive they provide you a lengthy menu and ask you to first order at the counter and then to get your seat (I assume to keep people from spending too much extra time at the table).  We sat first for a few minutes so we could review the menu without having to feel pressured to order quickly.  The Grove was highly recommended by the InterContinental Hotel staff."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Grabbed a bite to eat for lunch.  Nice decor and friendly staff.  Bread was tasty and pleasant.  Crunchy crust and soft insides... The blt was good... Not great.  I enjoyed my visit and will certainly return if in the area
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Reeeeally disappointed :/  Food came suspiciously fast.  Ordered chicken wings, a portobello mushroom and sweet potato salad, and a breakfast burrito.  Each of these felt overpriced as heck due to absolutely generic food quality and tastelessness (chicken wings were rubbery, breakfast burrito was really dry and had no sauce/flavors within, the salad sounded fancy but was a pain to eat and also extremely generic).  I was really looking forward to a great experience due to the other reviews but the food I got was far from worthwhile (especially given the prices! $13 for 5 rubbery chicken wings!)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Found this place on the internet searching for a good breakfast. The staff was awesome and would stop what they were doing to help you. I ordered our food and it came to the table in about 5 minutes. It was fresh, hot and tasted great. It also has a welcoming atmosphere to relax in."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"What an amazing find thanks to reviews on TripAdvisor. We were outside before 8am and there was already a queue forming, so we knew we were on to a good thing.  We were right, from customer service to food, to the layout. The whole concept of The Grove is excellent.  It was so good we went two days on the run and that, for us, is unheard of.  Recommended dishes inc. Eggs and avocado, Granola and the French toast."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Good convenient restaurant in the central hotel district! Serves good tasty food at reasonable prices! Better than many hotels ! From breakfast to dinner! Recommend
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Been here 3 times so far, one for dinner and twice for breakfast. Super friendly staff! Amazingly cozy atmosphere with delicious food. I would definitely recommend the muffaletta, carrot cake and avocado egg toast. Also fresh pressed orange juice is great. Will definitely be going back again before going back home. Probably my favorite find in San Francisco."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This place rules! 🥪🥪🥪  We were able to pop by this restaurant during DreamForce and it was such an incredible lunch experience. The staff was super kind and the food was delicious. This was definitely one of the best Reuben sandwiches I’ve ever had.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Had breakfast and lunch both were so good!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great find! Five star breakfast! Taste and price! Will come back for lunch and dinner.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent experience. The location is perfect for nearby hotels, the food was delicious, but above all, the service was spectacular. I was treated very well by all the staff. Most importantly, from the time I walked in, to when I ordered, to when I received my food, was extremely fast. I came here in a rush for breakfast and was expecting delays, but the team really surpassed expectations. This will be my go to place for breakfast every time I fly into San Francisco."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This place has a good vibe and I really like the food over here. I really love the hot chocolate at this place.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great burrito. Great place to meet and enjoy an easy meal. Bloody Mary had too much ice and was too watered down - like the shadow of the real thing.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Went to The Grove (Yerba Buena) for lunch today (after the lunch rush) because I was craving breakfast food and The Grove is one of the few restaurants that serves breakfast all day. This is one of the highlights of The Grove’s menu. Who doesn’t love breakfast right?! So I ordered The Grove French Toast, a side a crispy applewood bacon, and a side of scrambled eggs to go. The only issue I have with The Grove is that it’s pricey for small quantities. The quality of the food is impeccable but the quantity for the price leaves customers with something to be desired. The French toast comes with two thick slices of custard soaked batard bread which is amazing! The french toast, eggs, and bacon combo is definitely a must try if you’re visiting. The side of eggs I ordered, was NOT worth the almost $3 for the portion. Beware of side orders because it’s expensive."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Absolutely delicious brunch!! The herb sauce on the breakfast sandwich was amazing. They have a separate entrance/staff for to go orders and a really fun cafe area with 2 stories and various seating options for dine in.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is a little gem in the Yerba Buena neighborhood. Very close to the Moscone Center, it is my place of choice for breakfast and/or lunch when I attend a conference there. This time I attended 6 times in one week - had their all-day breakfast items (including their delicious granola and avocado toast with poached eggs), their decadent sandwiches (yes Ruben, I’m talking about you) and perfect eggs Benedict.  Super nice service and outdoors terrace seating (too rare in SF...) make me miss it already.  See you next year!  [edit Jan 2022] I said see you next year in 2020... well for obvious reasons my plans have changed and I'm happy to come back to the Grove in 2022! Still the best food place around Moscone Center ;)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,What a nice treat!!! We planned a Sunday visit to the SFMOMA. The Grove is less than a 5 minute walk away and made a perfect destination for lunch. Outdoor seating was ideal. Very comfortable. The menu has something for everyone. No table service. No problem. Our order arrived in about 10 minutes. The BLT with avocado was fantastic. Dessert? They have that too. Our choice - banana cream pie. Mmmmmm! A true 5-star experience!!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"First time here. Had a Reuben sandwich with chips and an iced tea. Nice relaxed atmosphere, quick service, and pleasant staff.  But the one thought that went through my mind the whole time was, ""this pastrami is next-level"". I didn't just thoughtlessly eat and browse Reddit. I had to concentrate on how good the pastrami was. It was so good, it completely overshadowed the other ingredients, but I didn't mind."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Delicious breakfast! The cashier recommended we get meals that include their bread because it’s FRESH BAKED. She was 100% spot on! I got the avocado egg toast with hash browns. My son got the breakfast special and ate it too quickly for me to even grab a picture. Highly recommend this spot. Good vibe inside too-
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A good breakfast spot with a big menu. I had the New Yorker, which was an egg sandwich with pastrami and sweet horseradish sauce. It was fairly small, but tasted great. Consider ordering something else if you're really hungry. My partner ordered the breakfast burrito which was massive and filling."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Went here for breakfast during Dreamforce, they had free breakfast one day and the next I paid for it. Cozy restaurant but a bit crowded which of course is natural when something is free.  Not the cheapest breakfast I've had (when I paid for it) but it was good. We sat outside and the food was a bit cold when we got it which was a little bit disappointing but still it tasted great."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Quite expensive sandwiches, but boy are they tasty. The Reuben is worth the visit alone. Place your order at the counter and then sit down with your order number and wait for the speedy staff to deliver to your table. Outdoor seating is limited, but indoor seating is spacious."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"You walk in and feel the friendly vibe, then taken in your orders by efficient staff, finally complete the experience there with great Eggs Benedict.  The unexpected bonus is the Rosemary in the hash browns, which made it most memorable for me!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place was some of the best food we ate while in San Fran. From the moment I walked through the door it was spot on. The place is cozy modern yet it’s original making you feel so relaxed to sit in or out for a great meal. Food and atmosphere is very trendy. Staff and everyone was great, friendly and on top of what service should be. Now the food OMG AWESOME! I do not need to say much for the food it speaks for its self. I could try everything on the menu and would love it. You know you are at a good place when the manager visits your table to make sure everything is perfect."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My nephew invite us to this amazing restaurant. Food was great. Portion were perfect. They offer fresh squeezed orange juice. I only gave it a four star because I have to consider cost, atmosphere, hospitality,  service, cost of food, quality of food. I would definitely recommend it, just expect to pay 20-30 dollars per person.."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had the Avocado toast and a salad, both very good. Fun place to eat at."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food was good, but the attention with the girl from the front desk was a bit rude when treating me."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food was yummy but so expensive… for eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast I paid $30… maybe I’m used to pricing back home but wowza! It was a filling meal but it hurt my stomach. The staff was really nice though and the ambience was cool. You can totally work here/read here."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,All good except bacon still flabby after I asked for extra crisp.  Absolutely great sound system.  I'm still not sure if the music was live or not but I could hear details like the pick against the guitar strings.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent food, but definitely pricey. I recommend the biscuit and the hash browns."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Really fun vibe. Split a pastrami and a Reuben sandwich with a friend. Portions were big and the sandwiches rivaled what I've had at NYC delis. Service was quick too. My only gripe was they put way too much horseradish in the bloody Mary mix. The place still got 5 stars for the food and service alone.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Went there for breakfast with friends. What a cozy restaurant!!! Delicious burrito! Love the place!! Outdoor seats are cute as well!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Went here for lunch. Was hoping for much better experience for almost $15 lunch. I wanted the cheesesteak but they’re not able to make it without peppers so I decided to go with Mac n cheese. What I got was a sad little bowl of Mac n cheese with a side salad. Not worth my money, didn’t even taste that great. My coworker got the quesadilla and said it was pretty good. We waited maybe 15 minutes or longer to get our food for take out."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Came thru just passing by & stumbled upon this breath of fresh air! The food was so super fast & very flavorful & with them being a pet friendly place, our huskies loved the place even more! ...just, it would've been 5stars, but one worker brought our some dog bowls of water that had food specs in it & was very dirty. But still, highly recommend this place!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I just ordered the Berkley bowl... how can you charge $17.25 for something that lacks so little substance?!?! That's $17.25 excluding tax & tip! It has to be the most expensive cost per calorie offering in the whole city. It's basically a side salad. Nothing is cooked in it so the labor costs are practically zero, I could make this at home for less than $3. Other restaurants would charge $10 for something like this. Daylight robbery! By the way, it came with no dressing..."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Nice spot for a meal.  A little confusing when you walk in - there is no host or signage. Turns out, the menus are in baskets, place your order at the counter and pay, get a number, and then go find a table.  The avocado toast! I'd go back for this in a heartbeat. It is perfect! Generous on the avocado and just the right amount of oil, lemon, and salt. DELISH!  Hubby got the meatballs; they were very dense and somewhat spicy. Side salad is small and light on dressing.  The braised short ribs were fantastic and I'd order them again for sure.  Had to try the boysenberry pie. Not too sweet, it made a nice end to the meal."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,We came to the Grove for brunch and loved it. The first thing that caught our attention is the nice warm and cozy ambiance. You sit where you want and order at the counter. The food was perfectly done - delicious. The OJ was fresh squeezed and the coffee was amazing too. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Great place for a bite.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very cute place for a happy hour with sweet staff.  Pictured: Negroni + Margarita
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I like that it was pay in advance. Good food, fairly priced."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My favorite spot to have breakfast downtown. Freshly squeezed orange juice, delicious avocado toast and eggs Benedict. Homemade granola and fresh fruits. Small terrace, nice decor. I love this place!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food here is rather nice, but nothing worth writing home about. It's a nice little bar/Cafe hybrid.  It's rather select in its offerings but it does what it does well.  Definitely a high ambience eatery."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Best brioche in san Francisco during my 3 weeks there. Great food and awesome service.  My hubby dropped a slice of avocado toast with an egg Benedict on the floor. They replaced it immediately. No questions asked. Very impressed with the level of service.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Cute little breakfast spot in SF with delicious food and great customer service. For those eating at the restaurant, you order your food first outside then you can sit down inside or outside.  Pro Tip: The breakfast burrito, The Glove Sandwich and the French Toast are all amazing."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is all Do it Yourself (DIY) service : you order at the front, get a number and few hours later, vintage food from the 1960s is ready for you to pick up; it’s food quality is fit for prisons but at exorbitant prices; staff is belligerent if you ask for Tabasco; The vegetarian food served is instant formula baby food. The leather in the seats is hard but its edible if your food is bad; atmosphere is of a hospital canteen! There is no hospitality here but it sure feels like a hospital; their attitude is GFY not just DIY."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Best hash browns I have had in a long time! Poached eggs, quiche and coffee were perfect. Great breakfast and lunch spot. Oh and treat yourself to the freshly squeezed OJ. A delicious place to brunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Nice restaurant to hang out with friends and family. The salads are good but the sandwiches are ok. Prices of the place are reasonable for the place and food.  I ordered the Chicken apple salad, this plate has between 4 or 5 pieces of roasted chicken which was juicy and good. The flavor of the salad in general was sour more than sweet. This was an interesting combination of flavors. I recommend that.  My other friends were not happy with their food. The chicken sandwich and tuna melt didn't have a lot of filling and the sandwich looked  completely flat. They ended up leaving part of the sandwich.  Also they mentioned that the coffee was warn and not hot."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is truly a locals' cafe in a district full of out-of-towners. Fresh ingredients, tasty food, good coffee, friendly staff, sort of trendy ambience. Really nothing to complain about."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of my favorite places to eat in San Francisco whenever I'm in town.  The food is consistently excellent.  Their avocado toast, French toast, quiche, omelettes are all exceptionally well made.  It's also a great atmosphere with excellent service.  I mean next level excellent service."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Love coming to The Grove every time we're back in SF. Lovely staff & delicious food. I had the Berkeley bowl for breakfast & hubs had the bacon quiche. Both so delicious.  Pro Tip: The mimosa package is about the price of 3 mimosas. So, that's a must if you're  planning on 3+ of those.  Also it was toasty warm upstairs if you're on the chilly side. We like to sit on the ""rail"" to people watch. =)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The host couldn't be nicer. They had seating to allow me to recharge my phone as I waited for my dinner date. The vegetarian chilli soup was great! Wanted more. Overall ambiance was superb.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I visited this place by chance, literally by looking into google maps. I felt welcomed since I arrived, which gave me an impression of a good customer service. It was indeed. I went twice to this place to have breakfast as you can see in the photos. My first choice was definitely better. I’ll try the homemade granola in my next visit."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Delicious food.  I had lunch there and it was priced adequately.  Definitely some nice eats with a beautiful seating area.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove was an amazing find, and a fantastic spot for a breakfast/afternoon date. Steps away from the MOMA, it's located in a convenient spot. They have plenty of heated outdoor seating, so even in the winter it's  comfortable to sit outside. It has a great quirky cabin vibe, and plenty of indoor seating too. The staff was friendly, and gave us samples of the different lemonades and sangria's to decide what to drink, I recommend the cranberry sangria. The Ruben was delicious, with a ton of meat, and the Mac and cheese blew my mind. The drinks are reasonably sized, so well worth the price. Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in SF!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"If the line is out the door dont let it discourage you from eating here. Line moves fast, I may have waited 5 min. Once you order at the counter they will bring the food to you  after you find a table.  I recommend the fresh squeezed OJ. Service is amazing and food is delicious."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good value for money! We ordered: Ranchero baked eggs 12.25$ Poached eggs over avocado 12.50$ Fresh oj (yum) 6.96$ Cappuccino (not great) 4.50 Almond croissant 3.95  Fun atmosphere, bring a sweater as it was a little chilly!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great brunch place. Fantastic avocado on toast for hopeless millennials like myself. Seating here is limited on the weekends but people are in and out fairly quickly. Huge dessert menu too. Lots of seating upstairs too.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Fresh squeezed orange juice, Bloody Mary, avocado toast with poached eggs, strawberry French toast and pear & strawberry salad. This is a great spot for delicious food."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Didn't really like the decor. The food was delivered quickly, but wasn't particularly good value for money."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"What are incredible service phenomenal food in their treats are out of this world, our Akita is a fussy eater, but loved there treat 🙌🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great spot with delicious food and a nice vibe.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is great! Their Yerba Buena location is cute and rustic, but expect a 15ish minute line on weekends and other busy times.  Their french toast is awesome. The eggs benedict is pretty good too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"So Tasty: The Burger, the Chicken Soup and the Goat Cheese Salad were just amazing. Even their orange juice tastes different! People serving you are so friendly."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The vibe was groove, the food was good and the service great! Price points are awesome and the Prime Rib delicious."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Tasty & good food. Liked the atmosphere since colorful & great service. Line to enter was 10 mins & woth it. Had PPE in restroom & it was clean.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is one of my favorite places to eat in downtown San Francisco. I love the decoration and the food is always good. They have a big menu so you will always find something to eat. The breakfast menu has a good selection of egg dishes, and for lunch the sandwiches and salads are excellent. Good service and reasonable prices."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"At the time that I went it was outdoor seating only, and the online menu differed slightly from the one posted at the restaurant. However, with all that said, the food was good,.and the prices reasonable. In fact all the food that I saw delivered to different tables looked good. Service was excellent and staff friendly. Definitely worth a visit. Go.Eat. Enjoy"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great service, quality food and coffee that will make others envious! 😍"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The French Toast was the best. I could taste the eggs of the batter on the outside, which made me feel like I was eating French Toast & eggs. Very filling."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice little bar/restaurant with plenty of healthy meal options and a wide selection of beers and adult beverages. Located in the heart of downtown SF next to Yerba Buena Gardens. Great atmosphere and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Excellent breakfast / brunch restaurant! I would totally recommend the Benedictine and the Kiche! Great service too
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good, nicely decorated location for a very popular San Francisco chain of breakfast/American food favorites. Enjoyed the hot chocolate and huevos rancheros, but I was underwhelmed by the eggs benedict with bacon and avocado, served atop a very thick English muffin, because they served it colder than lukewarm. Very unappetizing. May be willing to give them a second chance another time, as the service was fast and friendly."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,One of the best places in SoMa to get some breakfast or a snack. Great ambiance. Staff are awesome! Went here almost a week at a stretch for breakfast. The freshly squeezed orange juice is a must have. The coffee and hot chocolate are served generously. Yummy too. The benedicts are a must try. Tou might have to queue up to get in but is still worth it.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Nice place with a good food. A little bit noisy and strange system of order’s delivery (in one place you have to pick up your tea, in other place you have to pick up your coffee and in third place you have to take a sugar). But in general everything is very nice."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"As a French toast expert, the best I ever had. My friend enjoyed their breakfast sandwich. Fresh orange juice and freshly baked goods. Great atmosphere and friendly staff."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Overall cute place. A little pricey but so is the whole area. Some of the staff was amazing. Some of the staff was eh. Overall one of the better places I ate at on my trip.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I ate here during GDC week, and it was pretty crazy packed.  That said, the food, service, and surely the atmosphere (when not splitting at the seams) were all great.  I'd be a regular if I lived in the area."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Had an early breakfast on a Sunday morning.  There was a line out the door but it moved quickly and we were given a menu to help make decisions while we waited. The staff were very helpful and so friendly.  We ordered the French toast and breakfast burrito.  Definitely some of the best breakfast food we've ever had.  So yummy!  The place has a cool vibe too.  Will definitely go again the next time I'm in San Francisco.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Funky space with a good selection of drinks. We didn't eat here this time but the food did smell amazing.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food and a quick breakfast. I was staying at the W and instead of paying a ton for eggs I walked 400 feet and got a great meal.  Order at the back.left corner and sit any where you would like.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place was way yummy. The line was long but it was Christmas day. So we expected a wait. We both had a Grilled Cheese Sandwich, he had the tomato soup and I have the chicken lime tortilla. Both were very good."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was good, a bit pricey for my taste but overall I had a great experience. I loved the coffee Mocha."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"That place was amazing. If you like eggs benedict, this is the place to go to. Literally the best porched eggs I've ever had. The eggs were so creamy and very well seasoned. The place is good for breakfast lunch and dinner. Lets not forget the red velvet cake.. Made daily and delicious"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Sometimes you just need a good slice of cake. The Grove always has your back on that one.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Probably worst place I’ve been to. Order some chicken breast pie and IPA beer. First of all you come and order yourself, ok. Got that chicken breast pie, assuming I would get a whole chicken breast with side of vegetables. I got a tiny bowl of some stew of vegetables and little chicken pieces all wrapped in some dough. It wasn’t freshly made as it took 2 minutes to serve. Then the beer came in a can not from the tap. All was $30 such a waste of money on something so small and not fresh."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Review, take 2 (5 ☆'s)...  First visit left me wondering, so I came back. So glad I did!  This time, I brought my sweetheart and mom-in-law. We had the breakfast burrito, smoked salmon and goat cheese sandwich, and the warm cinnamon roll bread pudding. Omg, so freaking delicious! They did a much better job this time. I would definitely recommend this place.  1st review (3☆'s)...  The setting is really cool, and the service is very friendly. The food was pretty tasty, but didn't meet some basic expectations...  I had the Eggs Benedict (with Smoked Salmon) and hash browns.  The food was barely warm at all. The hollandaise sauce and eggs were tasty, but the English muffin was tough and chewy. It had the texture of microwaved bread; I had to use the steak knife provided, to tear it into bite-sized pieces. The potatoes were a little bland, and the portion was lacking.  With cool places like these, I tend to wonder if the mediocre food is an anomaly, or an accepted trade-off for the neat vibe of the space. I hope that it was an anomaly... There's so much potential here!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Was expecting this to be one of those goodlookin' hipster places with subpar food but it turned out to be pretty good! The scrambled eggs, hash and bread all delighted and satisfied. Needless to say the ambience was great with its interiors resembling a wooden lodge with tree-like structures. Would return if in the area. They also have their own blend of coffee which I will try next time."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food was delicious, I had the chicken pot pie, which was so good. The drinks are refreshing and filled with fruit. The salad dressing is amazing!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Ordered an egg benny here. The food was cold. The food arrived pretty quickly, so probably they cooked the food in advance and just plated it once there was an order. The English muffins were cold and hard. With the useless knife, it was so hard to cut it. To be honest, it was the worst benny I have ever had."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Well, the food was “good” normal, based on the long lines on weekends I was expecting outstanding food! However, my scoring is because of the way we were treated by Alejandra (the cashier who took our order). I just made a simple question: “Do you have French Vanilla?”, and her response and manners were so rude. Alejandra: if you did not know what it is something or if you don't offer something it does not mean that does not exist!!!! It was a simple Yes/ No question! I am attaching an image for your reference Alejandra:"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Loved this gem. We ate breakfast here most every morning.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The food and service was lovely and clean. My mother and I felt taken care of. Definitely coming back to this place.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was so-so. Cool atmosphere. Easy to find. Great staff. Overpriced, but what isn't overpriced in SF?"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"High quality fresh and delicious food, great drip coffee, friendly service. Most important, many locals, it’s not touristy."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I had breakfast here the week of a very busy convention at Moscone. I’ve eaten here once before and it was fine, and this time was super busy, so I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt. My colleague and I ordered and the guy at the counter was helpful and speedy. We ended up waiting well over half an hour for our food. It was nearly time for us to leave when we were brought a cold omelet and hash browns. Since we had already waited so long, we didn’t have time to flag someone down or wait for a reheat. I had to choke down some cold bites and jet. It looked like the cook had forgotten about it halfway through the cooking because the cheese on the omelet wasn’t even melted yet, so it didn’t seem to be a server that let it get cold. I bet it would have been great if it had been hot. I had really been looking forward to a good breakfast before a long day at the convention hall, so I was very disappointed."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Best latte I’ve ever had. Breakfast was delicious! The egg & salmon sandwich was great and very filling. Went on a Sunday morning around 9am - long line out the door but it moved quickly. You order at the counter then seat yourself. The decor was fun and warm.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Spectacular healthy food.  Ate breakfast there 2 days of my business trip.  Highly recommend the avocado toast with egg, either poached or scrambled.  Gluten free toast was absolutely delicious. Side salad was yummy.  I will be back!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The service was good.  But the food was really bad. We ordered a burger an the meat wasn’t in good condition.  Also there was a man inside the restaurant yelling and the staff didn’t do anything with that situation. It was uncomfortable.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Delicious gluten free bread for sandwiches.  All our food was incredible. Very fun spot.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Counter-order. The portions here were huge-- some chicken even escaped off of my salad while I was cutting it since it was piled so high.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Lots of great options in the menu. I had the Roasted Vegetable Salad which was very good. Their orange juice was a good too.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,In a word: fantastic. I absolutely loved the food! The menu had a variety of breakfast and lunch items to choose from. The poached eggs on avocado toast tasted great and was well seasoned. The salad had a delicate oil and vinegar dressing with the right amount of acid. So good. I will definitely revisit this restaurant next time I am in San Francisco.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We were at a conference in San Francisco the first week of November 2022 and wanted to take our customers to dinner. I contacted catering at The Grove and Christina was so easy to deal with, so I booked the Mezzanine for 20. The day before the dinner we had a partner whose reservation for the same type of dinner was cancelled by his restaurant and needed help, so I called Christina and upped our reservation to 30 for no additional base charge.  Walking in my boss was a little worried as she saw the order counter but was instantly reassured as we headed upstairs.  Unlike the main restaurant it was menu service with dedicated wait staff, who were amazing.  We had 3 tables of 6 and two alcoves that could seat 2 or 3 so our customers got to have great conversations during dinner.  Since being back we have had two bookings from attendees at that dinner and I believe it was a direct result of the atmosphere The Grove has built.  Thank you and I WILL be back!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great atmosphere, awesome service, friendly staff, and most importantly great food"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good food, good service, but it's on the expensive side. I like the atmosphere and decor, too. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was pretty good. I had some of the French toast and it was good, too. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, mainly due to price, but if you're in the area it's a solid option."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Nice place to eat breakfast, as recommended (it definitely has more variety than other places around). Service is pretty fast and you get what you want. It definitely offers a different choice to all the other coffee shops around.  This said, the food is not that great, especially for the price you pay and the place is unbelievably loud! People at the counter seem to feel a bit superior (for no reason) and sometimes even sound rude to some clients (especially to non-english speaking foreigners who try to catch what they say)."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent big brunches with plenty of vegetarian options! We got the French toast and breakfast burrito, both of which were yummy. The decor inside is Western style, with plenty of seating. Be prepared to queue up on weekends. The queue moves fast and the team are so efficient, making sure we have our menus before entering. Loved the freshly squeezed orange juice, it was a real treat!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Definitly worth a visit. Many different choices of foods to have. Can have a bit of a line sometimes. You have to order first then find a table to sit down. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good food, would have been 5 stars if the food was hot. Hasbrowns where nearly cold, sandwich was luke warm. Coffee was piping hot."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Brunch is awesome, but subdays are cery crowded. Great salads, french toasts and awesome ginger cucumber spritzer. Hot beverages will be served before anything so be careful of ordering hot beverages with your meal."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great place for a nice brunch.  Service is good; you pick up your own drinks, but food is served at your table. Usually very busy, but moves along quickly. I recommend it."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Relaxing atmosphere and really good food, I haven't had a bad plate, but I didn't like the fact that a small OJ was 6 bucks and the fruit toppings for the French toast were extra (wasn't mentioned at register). I like this place but it's a bit pricey for some of the items you wouldn't expect... I felt like I was hit with a phone bill from all the small fees lol. Grab a coffee or juice before coming in and you're set!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice place I would recommend for a lunch. The food was good but I wouldn't recommend the cocktails.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I liked it a lot! I had the Berkeley Bowl, which was an enormous, surprisingly densely packed salad. I got the tuna salad on top of it and found it slightly too salty for my taste. There were lots of other things I wanted to try, but alas, only one stomach. If I lived in SF I would return."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Strongly recommend this place. The food and drinks were DELICIOUS! The waiters and manager was extremely helpful. Can't wait to go back 😊 …
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food (taste, presentation, portions). Outstanding Service."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good food, atmosphere, music, and service. A few vegan options plus you can sub gf toast with any meal!  Must try the Berkeley bowl! Super delicious and fresh.  Nice pie and pastry offerings, with some gluten free and vegan options."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The best chia breakfast bowl we’ve had!! The mimosa package was amazing!  They don’t have dine in yet, but they have open patio seating with fast service!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Love this place!  I always stop to eat here when I come to San Francisco.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Such a happy place. Everyone who works there, from the guy handing out menus at the door to the person cleaning the tables, seems really glad to be working here, and the friendliness makes a huge difference. The food is made with care and quality ingredients. I had the Denver omelette, and the rosemary hash browns were delicious. If your first reflex is to smother hash browns in ketchup — don’t. These stand on their own. The atmosphere is very comfy, and even when busy, the food comes out quickly. I’ll go back for sure."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The Reuben was very good. The meat was smoky and delicious. Fast  and Friendly service.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,It’s my first time visiting this place and it’s pretty good. I had my dog with me so we had to seat outside but the inside was very cozy. The French onion soup was hot and very tasty. I love the melted cheese on top.  One of my coworkers ordered the Garden Scramble and he said it was really good.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The best gluten free avocado poached egg on toast I’ve ever had! The gluten free bread was so good I thought they gave me regular bread and got the order wrong. LOL! Nope, just excellent GF bread."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We visited this location for breakfast. The staff was nice and friendly and the service was fast. The restaurant was nice and clean. The food was overpriced ($100+ for 5 people, 4 sandwiches, biscuit, & 3 drinks) and the portions were small. However, it was good. The staff made a mistake by switching orders within our party and corrected it right away. Note: if you dine outdoors be sure to clean the seats and table. A person without a home sat at an outdoor table and was asked to leave by staff. The individual vacated the seat, but did walk through the outdoor area touching additional tables before leaving."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food is good but they seem to forget things when they deliver your food to the table . I have eaten here multiple times and it happens to atleast 1 person at the table every time.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food was excellent, nice, quality products. The waiter was very friendly and quick with everything we needed. I would go there again!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The FiDi is a total breakfast desert most days (not including fast food) but The Grove at 3rd/Mission is not merely an oasis for the hungry.  It's a destination in itself.  The o.j. is delicious. Get one for sure. It can get darn busy, but it moves."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The mimosa was delicious. The avocado egg toast was tasty. I had a good celebratory breakfast on a Sunday morning here.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had a great breakfast here, despite eating out of plastic takeout containers at their parklet. It's too bad they don't do dine in yet (as of early May 2021 anyway) but I would gladly come back to try the other items on their menu!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Phenomenal breakfast food, worth the wait! Great service, a must stop to get the San Francisco experience."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Found this place for lunch while attending a conference at Moscone West. Decent menu and pricing is consistent with other places in the area. The chicken pot pie had a good presentation, but a bit in the salty side. The ginger cucumber lemonade spritzer was delicious."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food is fine but over-priced. It's counter-service but they don't turn tables fast enough to make room, so expect a lot of standing around before and after you pay for the food. The host set aside a table for our party, promised it would be available for us after we ordered, then gave away the table while we were ordering at the counter."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Staff were nice. Restaurant was not busy, but nothing on either of our two plates were hot, barely even warm."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Came here caz of good reviews, hot pastrami was quite disappointing, bread was not that fresh, pastrami not hot, no sauce! (So very dry). When asked what the side salad is, I was told Greek, well I got some baby lettuce … really confused about the reviews."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"When you are in San Fran.  You have got to have breakfast here. Great people, service,  music and the food !!!! Off the charts"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The atmosphere is awesome. The location is cute, but the wait is INSANE. I thought that would mean the food would be fantastic and sadly it was not. It wasn't horrible by any means, but it definitely wasn't memorable. However, my Arnold palmer was FANTASTIC! And the staff were superb. Maybe it was just an off day."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Friendly greeting as we came in from the rain the greeter talked to us about the place and how things worked in a nice friendly manner and did not rush us at all as we shook out our coats and got the kiddo unbundled. Menus were handed to us and in a board above the ordering point. I had the breakfast burrito with black beans and Avocado, so well prepared with just the right amount of flaky outer tortilla, but still strong enough to hold it all together. Will be going back!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The atmosphere is inviting, fast service, and attentive staff. The pork ribs are killer. Burger is average and salads are good. I like to go there because they are consistent."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Delicious hashbrowns and fresh squeezed OJ. Their egg bennies with portobello and spinach was good and their salad is dressed heavily with oil and vinegar. Their breakfast special was decent.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great spot for all day breakfast or a good meal. The place is bigger than it looks, with an order first and then sit down concept. The food comes quickly and has great service. Tried the avocado toast with the ham which was good (I expected a bit more avocado on there - but it was still good)."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very popular place. The staff is very proficient but I can't say it is a welcoming place. The food was very good though.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Went for late lunch. Good ambience, and good food + portions. Lower score because service speed for drinks (bottle water and pre-made ice tea) was quite slow. Actual food came shortly after (so that was relatively quick)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Love this restaurant! Try the avocado toast, it’s great. Food is good and the staff super nice! Perfect to go with your dog in a sunny day to seat outside."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Exquisite Americana food Depot, with delicious sandwiches that I'd give 6 stars to if I could. RECOMMENDED: The turkey BLT with Harissa mayo is to DIE FOR. Also: two thumbs up for the delicious fresh hummus with warm pita bread. This place rocks!  the house manager tonight (Sat, August 24th) was particularly engaging, friendly, and knowledgeable about the restaurant. Give that man a raise!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food has attitude, portions are just huge, I couldn’t even finish my sala. Cozy place :)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Having been here many times before Covid, our expectations were high, but the quality of the food has declined and we will not be returning. Food was cold and hot drinks were cold. The bread in all the dishes was very hard and parts of it had been burned. This made much of each dish inedible. The most disappointing was the hot chocolate, clearly just a milky mess with little chocolate flavor. Used be really good, like this restaurant once was."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, attentive and nice service! Even during the lunch rush the food comes out fast. Everyone is so friendly ... I usually get the connection salad and have always been happy with it. The pies are also quite tasty if you need a sweet treat, especially the cherry pie."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Really awesome French toast and bacon. I didn't love the drip coffee, but still a nice breakfast spot."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Salad was delicious. I've also ordered chai latte, which was really good, however, I had to go twice looking for it. Lady, who was in charge of beverages were not at her station and didn't see my order, so I got my salad first and then had to ask server twice about my drink until he finally went there and told the lady that I'm waiting for my order. When she came to make it, she look quite annoyed too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,First breakfast spot we tried on our SF trip. Food was great and the service was quick.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Real great food, beer and vibes 👍"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I had an amazing breakfast here with poached eggs, avocado toast and a great cafe latte."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Ridiculous breakfast portions for the price. Bitter coffee and undisclosed fee didn't help the experience.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Abel was such a great host, always attentive and wonderful customer service will certainly visit again"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The tall doorman did a great job explaining the concept. We had the hummus plate, and a  bloody Mary.  It was great!  We loved the look inside.  It was great and a lot of fun!  The hummus plate had crispy Romain lettuce to dip in it also."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Really good flavorful and fresh food. Very friendly staff with a cool atmosphere. Lunch was so good we went back for dinner to try more of the menu. The iced chai tea is amazing. The pie looks delicious. I’ll be back again to try the pie. Between the Mac n cheese and the Asian chicken salad I liked the salad better. It’s a big salad and very filling . The bread that comes on the side was really good too.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,We sat outside and the table we had was so slanted we thought our plates might slide off. A large truck drove by and the wind blew through and we ended up with chunks of dirt and hair in our food and drinks.  We ended up leaving 2/3 of our meal. You might have a better experience if you sit inside.  Good luck finding seating on a Sunday.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Such a tasty resturant. My family went twice during our vacation and all 7 dishes we tried were delicious! I would reccomend the Vegetarian sandwich. The service was good and fast even the time they were busy.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food quality. Nice place to enjoy your breakfast.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The best French dip sandwich I ever had. Very big portions. I would recommend this restaurant 😋
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great service and very solid avocado toast, but not as tasty or inviting as other locations'."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great little cafe, was open for lunch on Thanksgiving so that was how we found it. Weird that the online menu says their signature dish is onion soup, which in fact they don't make nor show on their real menu! But their vegetarian sandwich (really a panini, since it's grilled) was delicious and amply made up for the disappointing lack of onion soup."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"There was a long line, but it moved quickly and the food was well worth the wait. I had the avocado toast with ham, and it was scrumptious. Their service was excellent. There were several choices. I highly recommend."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Cobb salad for 20+ baks was in a thick wooden bowl. Not much volume  of a salad, mostly the thickness of the bowl. Whatever you do, don't substitute for their fried organic chicken. It was dry, tough, and to my surprise  covered in gluten contaminant. The rest of the ingredients were fresh though. Their drinks looked interesting."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I ordered the tuna melt and a Bloody Mary. Both were fantastic. That sourdough bread was heavenly and the Bloody Mary was done right. I had no complaints. It was pretty busy but the servers were nice and my food came out in a timely manner.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Little pricey but the food and service were great!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The place doesn't know how to name it's food. First that's definitely not a chicken pot pie, it was more like a chicken bowl soup. Second pic was called spare ribs, definitely wasn't that and was more of a pot roast. Price was pretty expensive for being surprised with what you weren't expecting."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,A bunch of tasteless fatty meat inside a very dry bread.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Lovely brunch place. The French toast was very satisfying!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food and cool space. Very fresh and healthy options, I want to go back and try so many dishes!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent food in almost no time. Very well organized for viral times, outdoor seating with heaters."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I'm updating my original review. I was really looking forward to going to this place, and it feels like the service has gone downhill. For the most part, the food and drinks were great. It definitely seems like their coffees and such have gotten smaller, but everything is very high quality. Their fresh English Muffin breakfast sandwich is delicious, and so are the eggs benedict. They did mess up the sides a few times, so be sure and confirm.  However, I and the people I brought with me were treated pretty rudely by who seemed to be the manager of the counter-service addition cafe. I was in the area for business and was taking meetings here, but I was also constantly ordering food and drink for myself and everyone I was with, and tipping each time. Every hour. It was very busy because the weather was bad and because of the conference I was there for.  At one point, one of my colleagues went back inside and placed an order for three orders of eggs benedict (almost $60 alone), and another round of drinks. At that point, we had already ordered coffee and pastries less than an hour previous when we arrived. As we were waiting for our food, the manager(?) came out and told us we had to leave because there was an hour limit on tables - something not advertised anywhere. When I told him we had just placed an order for food we were waiting on (and a pretty substantial one), he grimaced and stood there for another few moments before he walked off.  We made sure to wrap up and go. After that, each time I came in during the week for food, he gave us a pretty unfriendly stare each time. Again, I get that the place was super busy and they didn't want people using the tables without paying, or just buying a bottle of water. But that wasn't us. I myself have a few hundred dollars in receipts from this place for the four days we were there, buying food and drinks for myself and others, and it was really awkward to be treated like we were loitering or not paying customers. I did not feel welcome there, unlike the amazing experience I have had in years previous, and probably won't be coming back."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Foods are delicious. Service is very good. Place is very fun.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very good food and nice outside seating but the breakfast burrito would be better with hash browns and cheese inside instead of black beans.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Central location and perfect to stop for a quick coffee and a bite to eat when you’re in town for a conference at the Moscone Centre. The staff here, like most places in San Francisco are warm and welcoming, the menu has a wide selection and there is a lot of room to sit and relax. The food was good, though mine arrived slightly cold. Though the staff were quick to get me a new warm plate and regularly topped up my coffee with a warm smile as I dazed at my MAC and continued to work."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,BEST breakfast burrito in caps! My oat milk latte was delicious too. Highly recommend this place.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent breakfast, fresh ingredients.  The freshly squeezed orange juice is delicious!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Good LARGE coffee. Nicely decorated with good outdoor seating. Good service and clean restrooms. Moderately priced.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I had never met such a gross person attending to the public; they do not know how to deal with the public, and even less with tourists; in short, I give them a star because Google doesn't allow me to put cero. I do not recommend the site; the person who maltreated us is called Alejandra"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I love this place. Anytime in in town for a conference I take as many breakfast meeting here as I can manage.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very good breakfast, little bit expensive but in line with the other bar. People Very kind!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The food was good but the service better very fast and handled with care.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,YUM!  We were in SF for 4 nights and we went here for breakfast 3 times!  It's right around the corner from the Palace Hotel so it was super convenient for us.  I'll be dreaming of that egg sandwich on a biscuit with a side of crispy hashrbrowns forever....
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great spot with easy and fast ordering. Quality food at a fare price.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove was a great find! Just down the street from SF MoMA. Bustling place with standard American fare. Tried the Avocado Egg Toast,  Reuben sandwich, and Apple Chicken Salad. Lavender lemonade is very sweet and tart. Reuben was my favorite. You order at the counter and seat yourself. Service was fast despite it being busy."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great place at a great location. Breakfast menu till 4PM. Quite touristy but I still go as they have good quality food. I've had salads, sandwiches, chili, coffee and beer over multiple visits. Quality has always been good. Kind staff"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Rueben sandwich tastes amazing and is super generous with the pastrami! Chicken pot pie is delicious too
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Some of the most delicious food in sf, I love going for lunch or diner! Their breakfast sandwiches and hashbrowns are a go-to and I loveeee the pot roast! Really fun atmosphere and quality food!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very cool vibe.  Nice spot for brunch. The food and service are delicious.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Marvelous place for breakfast. A tad expensive but certainly worth the money. We ate there 4 out 5 days in SF. Very busy on weekends but the turnover of customers is fairly high so the wait isn't too long.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Wow, what a great restaurant!  There were multiple items on the menu I wanted to try, but I chose to go with the breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint!  The atmosphere was outstanding also.  I would like to come back to experience other menu items and this fantastic fast-casual restaurant!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,A great breakfast spot. Really enjoyed the avocado toast with poached eggs. Simple but delicious. The vibe on the weekday was really nice. Very cozy and quiet but have heard the weekends are pretty busy.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The most disappointing dining experience of my San Francisco vacation. Very expensive, yet uninspired, below-average food. Worst of all was the nearly non-existent service. My meal was served after everyone else in my party had finished their meal. No apology offered, though one would have been appreciated. There are too many exciting restaurants in this town to waste your time and money here."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My wife and I have been here twice and we've really enjoyed it. The food comes in huge portions and what we've enjoyed the most is the fresh orange juice. The service is really fast and the place is nice and cozy. You can come anytime for a nice meal, it doesn't matter if you're eating solo."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food , fresh squeezed OJ! Was in SF for 5 days and did 3 days of breakfast here !"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Nice brunch with good selection of staples. The French toast was excellent, but plenty to share. The wait staff was very attentive and made sure we had what we needed. Overall a nice casual brunch option."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Well this place has gone downhill in the last couple of years. Second visit in a week, so the benefit of the doubt has gone. They still serve great food, but that’s all they do. The dining experience is now akin to being on a conveyor belt. From the moment the surly “greeter” barks orders as to where to stand in line, to the fruitless attempt to get a top up of your $5 basic (weak) coffee, there is simply no engagement. Get you seated, get you fed, get you out. And because you pay when you order, you tip for this decidedly mediocre service in advance."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Pastrami sandwich is unique and fantastic, chicken salad was good, french toast yummy, tacos solid.  Service was excellent and lines went briskly."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Avocado toast was dry and hard.  Poached eggs cold.  Salad was arugula.  Banana bread dry.  Everything overpriced.  Service was decent.  Coffee was good but had grounds.  Place can't handle weekend traffic.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great place for breakfast or lunch. Fresh food great flavor staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is fun.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Stopped in for brunch on a Saturday. The line was a bit long, but moved quickly. We were also able to find a table without issue. I had an OJ (fresh squeezed, very good) and the eggs benedict. My wife had a turkey sandwich that she liked very much. Definitely a good spot for a nice quick brunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great place for a casual dinner or breakfast! Prices are reasonable, presentation and surroundings are welcoming, and the compositions are simple but well executed."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Cool atmosphere but food was just ok.  Breakfast omelet was like warm and meatball sandwich was relatively flavorless. Bread was great, rest of the sandwich, very average"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Restaurant well agenced, really original. Awesome fresh salads and drinks. Usually very crowded."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Super friendly service.  The food comes out fast and fresh even when they are super busy.  That Cobb salad was amazing!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Two stars for my second visit. The place itself is great for outdoor dining, staff at the service counter was super friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, one waiter and one guy who I suspected was the floor manager were so rude, they gave me unpleasant attitudes about holding on to the menu while sitting outside. Hence the 2 star. Guys, it's seriously ridiculous to harass your paying customer over something so trivial. You need my business, not the other way around. 🙄"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Rode the cable car up from fisherman’s wharf, walked around a bit and found this place. Good atmosphere. Great service! Had a great doorman/host. Very welcoming. All the food looked amazing. Ours was delicious"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,$29 for THE MAVEN (8oz) and the EAST BAY IPA ALE (1 pint). Absolutely delicious!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Overrated, very overpriced. The avocado toast was like $16 and had issues - was barely lukewarm and therefore unappetizing/unappealing/poor-textured AND the two eggs on top were inconsistent - one runny and the other not at all. The apple crisp was delicious but also very overpriced. They also had it sitting on the counter for way too long before I had to ask about it and they realized they forgot about it. Poorly run system, and it wasn't even that busy. Oops. Fortunately the apple crisp was in a foil carrier, so it stayed decently warm. Sadly the best thing was probably the lavender lemonade. Yum. But I can't even give this place 4 stars, let alone 5, after that very subpar and overpriced experience. Try again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very delicious. Both Breakfast Specials and omelets are great! Coffee is tasty. The freshly squeezed OJ is great as well!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is what I needed this morning. Groovy, funky and delicious! Fresh food made with passion. Been here as one great experience of Dreamforce 2017. thanks to the owners of The Grove."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,It's so beautiful here! The employees are friendly. It's clean. There are children everywhere and they are RESPECTFUL. What a welcome change.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I seriously think this is my favorite place here in downtown SF :)
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This place is so incredibly cozy and the food was astounding. Definitely a must-visit.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The breakfast burrito was so good that I came back the next day for another one. I usually don't do that on trips.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A Family business in San Francisco, extremely welcoming staff, food is great, the egg sandwich is a must and the coffee is great we went there for breakfast and definitely going back again, and they have CRYSTAL hot sauce."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food was good and the atmosphere is fun. However one of the cleaning staff repeatedly hit me with a broom
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This is the worst breakfast I've ever had. The eggs in the Eggs Benedict tasted strange. The English Muffin had a strange consistency and appeared to have been frozen. The ham was also off. The hash browns were soft and soggy instead of crispy. The biscuit was terrible and the strawberry preserves tasted like what you might find on an ice cream sunday. Do not order the drip coffee. Do not eat here!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The place looks nice, but that's the only good part. The food was dry. Having the breakfast special had dry bacon, dry hash browns, and dry bread with poached eggs just lumped on the side. I used ketchup to hydrate it all while the cheap salt and pepper packets tried to add flavor. Adding that there is no service, but they expect at least an 18% tip is a joke."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very satisfying and nice place to be. Ate outdoors which was fine even though it’s always busy with traffic and people in the streets.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Extremely bad service. Staff don’t care about you or the experience you’re having. Food was terrible too… i had coleslaw, sweet potato and pork ribs. The rib meat must have been the cheap off cuts as it was mostly gristle and bone. Couldn’t even pay me to return back."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is a must-stop for breakfast if you're staying in San Francisco, especially if you're staying near SF MoMA or off Market Street, near Union Square. The orange juice is incredible and squeezed fresh right in front of you. The deep dish quiche is a revelation. Don't leave without a piece of cake, or a cookie.  Be aware: there is typically a line out of the door to place an order, so I recommend getting there at opening for the best experience."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Mac and cheese was very tasty here. We also got the grilled cheese, the tomato basil soup, and an oven-fried chicken sandwich. All pretty good. The lavender lemonade was tasty, too. Cool decor."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Inflation has hit this place hard. 2/3 as much food as 6 months ago. 1/3 more expensive too.  At these prices and the portion size, the grove is daylight robbery. If you have infinite money, the food is pretty good though!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The food is monster size so be aware of your orders. I enjoyed the laid back vibe and how easy the staff were.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I had the California hot dog platter with the raw slaw and recommend it if you like a gourmet dog. It's pricey (this is the City) but there's a bunch of other good looking stuff on the menu including breakfast all day.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Have loved the Grove since the first time we walked in more than 10 years ago. It's right next to MoMa and Yerba Buena Gardens.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This place has some excellent food presentation! Delicious salad too! Thank you  for helping me with keto friendly options. Brought my own salad dressing because I wasn't entirely sure if their dressing met my dietary restriction
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Damn fine breakfast foods. I had french toast and banana bread. It made me quite happy.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food. It's truly a hidden gem.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The reinvention of the portobello mushroom burger is just one reason to experience the good vibe at the Grove.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,It's a MUST! Don't let the line deter you... they are efficient and helpful and kind as you move through the line. And the food is absolutely worth it! Spent four days in San Fran and this was the winner by far! Service... spectacular. Food... phenomenal. Atmosphere... lively and welcoming!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Excellent portions. Awesome atmosphere. Delicious food and drinks. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area looking for a bite to eat. We plan to come back in the future.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very mediocre experience. It’s cold and rainy out. Soup and chili came out at room temperature. Someone cut in front of us to add more food/drinks to their order adding a few extra minutes to our wait. They were open so I’ll give you a star for that.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A reliable and unpretentious place for breakfast,  lunch or dinner, which is usually slowest time of the three. Had pot pie and club sandwich both came quickly with a side salad. Not fancy but certainly hits the spot in an area struggling to sustain restaurants."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The service was great. All of the people were very kind and helpful and the food was delish! I am so glad we stopped in.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food with fresh ingredients.   Eggs benedict are really good.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"High quality food and fantastic service, had a great brunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Super cool, spot with a chill, retro American spot. The inside of the restaurant is super neat, with interesting decor. Great spot for a chill dinner. The food was delish!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I visited this place twice cause the food was really good and the prices normal for USA. Try the American special breakfast with ham and the carrot cake.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Yummy food & amazing service! I had a great experince here, with super friendly staff, a great atmosphere & delicious food. NOTE: more vegan options would be great!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Love it here! Fast amazing food good drinks at a good price!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Paid $20 for a burrito and I got a wet egg in a tortilla. they forgot the chicken the beans AND potatoes. Waste of my time and money
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Tried the French Dip, it was pretty good. The dip is very tasty. Could use a bit more beef. The water melon lemonade is really good, tasted fresh and not too sweet. Bit too much ice."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Amazing service, food and layout. Top notch place! Def coming back tomorrow!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Been back multiple times, this place never disappoints. Breakfast all day and great tacos/paninis. It's not the fastest place, but the food is worth the short wait. Definitely check this place out!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I’m putting 3 stars only because of the cashier service and response. I’m vegan, just wanted to add mushrooms to my avocado toast and the answer was a definitely “I can’t do that”. The food and the coffee were amazing.."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The reuben sandwich is delicious!!  Had eggs Benedict today with a mimosa. Delicious!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Loved it here. Great finf on my trip into city
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Extremely rude man at the entrance. The whole visit felt like we were being picked on and rushed out.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is a casual dining place that has excellent food. I tried the Ruben, which was terrific, and my partner had a straight salad, which she said was one of the best she's ever had. You can sit outside of you want, and the seating on the inside first floor is spacious and inviting. The big score is on the second floor, there is this small nook that will seat 4 people comfortably. if it's available, take it."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Casual restaurant and I only ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the cucumber ginger soft drink. Delicious. Service is excellent.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We went there for brunch.  We loved the place and the food selections are decent.  The service was good.  You need to order the food before entering if you want to dine inside and show proof of vaccination.  You then get a number and the food will be brought to the table.  My wife ordered the Eggs Benedict with avocado and bacon and mimosa for a drink.  She enjoyed all of it!  I only ordered the pastrami sandwich and coffee which are just okay.  I gave it a 3-star for this reason and the price did not match the taste for me, however this is San Francisco and the Bay Area!  We are spoiled with many selections of good food!  Do not let the 3-stars discourage you.  Go check out this place."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food is good, the atmosphere is adorable with the indoor trees, and the service is always great.  Also, the last time I was there a man with a katana kept on trying to come in and I just want to shoutout the door guy for not letting him and dealing with that in a super calm and deescalating manner"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food was great. We went on Sunday and it was full. Had to wait in line for some time but it was worth it. The breakfast sandwich had a green spicy sauce aside that tasted great
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The French toast was incredible.  They have the best orange juice around and a really great environment.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Unique decor, good food and hospitable staff  makes it the place to go for! Egg Benedict and Chicken pot pie was a great option."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This was the cutest lil coziest place. The vibe was amazing. The food was great as well! I would highly recommend.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The Fresh lemonade is Delicious 😋!! Definitely would  recommend for people who likes sour!

The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great breakfast, ordered the grove Benedict and added Kids meal French toast, both are unbelievably delicious"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Wonderful breakfast! I had the sandwich with bacon and I would recommend trying the orange juice too.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Beautiful food. Everything on the menu is great. Don't miss the fresh OJ.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"True San Francisco place: cozy, very simple, but there are several good option for lunch meeting. I would not recommend to choose this place for a special occasion."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food and flavors.  Food came out fast.  Rustic appear joint with Broad classic favorite dishes by Americans with CA flair.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Loved the interior of this place! The service was good! The Food even better! Would definitely come back again!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Slammin’ vegetarian breakfast burrito and the portions are huge. Was a bit intimidated by the line to get in, but it moved fast and wasn’t difficult to find a table even though the place was busy. Definitely good for a weekend brunch!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Kids menu with accommodation of a 5-year-old’s firm stance against all sauces foreign and domestic + all day Benedict’s for me = a very happy daddy and daughter. So convenient to museums etc, I tried on a whim because of location. I’ll be back by choice soon!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Love this place for breakfast or lunch whenever I visit San Fran
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Busy place. I came here early. I love the Avocado toast!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The classics breakfast was pretty good, though I found the bacon to be slightly undercooked, and they advertise the eggs as soft scrambled which they were not, just your standard scrambled egg. Still tasty and filling though."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Decent food, nothing spectacular. Service is efficient and prompt. They went over and above for us in packing our order and getting it ready. The place is pricey and it can get very crowded at all hours of the day. But the food doesn't justify that."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The line was long (normal Saturday) but moved quick. I’d guess we waited for 15 minutes to be seated. Avocado toast was tasty but I wish it was bigger. The bloody Mary’s were so good!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great place for a lunchtime salad. I had a Cobb salad with an Arnold Palmer. Lovely experience.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Highly recommend!! Great customer service made even better by their food quality.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"So glad to see your still open...was worried!  Love this place, and will be back in SF in April to have your fine breakfast cuisine.  I have told several people about the exquisite Gove!  Hope it's as great as it was the week I stayed 2 years ago."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Interesting casual restaurant with excellent food.  The restaurant can be a bit cramped especially during busy times and when there is an event at the Mascone center so you may want to have a backup plan if you are on a tight timeline
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Execellent food and great choices offered. In door & out door tables and very cool atmosphere. Quick delivery of food. The breakfast and the healthy beverages are great.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"First time there, staff are nice and friendly.  The food was nice.  Great customer experience."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, cool ambience, very good service and vibe"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Loved going somewhere we felt safe anyone wanting to eat inside had to have proof of vaccination.  It was so soothing especially coming from the we care about profit and not people state of Texas.The food and service were good.. We make a point to go here whenever we are in San Francisco.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Solid food, and cute decor. Whenever I have guests in town I take them here before showing them the city."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Breakfast was very good.  Breakfast burrito and Avocado an toast was very good.  Banana bread wasn’t as sweet as I hoped but still very good.  Staff was very courteous.  Would definitely eat here again.  Loved the classic rock music they played.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Their food is yummy and the restaurant atmosphere is very cute. I love their freshly squeezed orange juice. I think it's overpriced though.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The burrito is remarkable. Large size means LARGE. Coziest high quality bf in downtown SF.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Quick service. Healthy options. Nice lighting and space for ample seating in case you’re in a crunch for organizing a brunch for a group of people.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Really nice interior, pretty good food, a little overpriced"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"friendly folks but super mediocre food, at least last night.  the veggie chili had about 10 beans in it and was 95% stewed /canned tomatoes with no spicing.  the side salad was a pile of wet lettuce with no other veggies . meh."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,33$ for a beer and a salad during happy hour.   What a rip off
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great friendly service and tasty food. Loved the IPA draft. And the music is great too!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The fresh squeezed orange juice is a must! I loved the smoked salmon Benedict. Plenty of seating room ideal for small sized parties
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food is just okay. Salads are big portion. Food comes out fast. Cute atmosphere.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great atmosphere, not too loud, upstairs was perfect for our group of friends (10) last minute. Good food. Cozy place!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Lovely brunch, great coffee, would come again!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very good food and service. They made a mistake on our order and were very quick to correct it. The inside looked really nice, like sitting in a forest. The Reuben's pastrami was a nice thick cut, like a quarter inch, and was reeaally good 👍 …"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent breakfast if your near convention center, also very expensive"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is a solid brunch spot. There’s not much in the area so it’s definitely the best around. Unfortunately, indoor dining is still closed so it’s set up so you order at the window and find a table, which I didn’t love and you miss the cool interior, but it was fine. The coffee cake bites weren’t as good as they sound, but the rest of the food was decent."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Perfect spot for breakfast all day or lunch. Lots of vegetarian options, house-made bread and granola, great coffee and a really good vibe!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Breakfast burrito was pretty mediocre and cost $18 after tax
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice place for a catch up in afternoon
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Avocado toast was cold and not tasty . Orange juice was good.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This is definitely one of the best experiences in dining that I've experienced. Being from a community of mostly locally owned restaurants and not many huge franchise restaurants it's extremely difficult to find comfort food and to feel comfortable in a place. I definitely have always felt comfortable and love the staff at this location. Food is delicious! And it's beautifully designed and decorated inside. Eggs Benedict with Bacon and Avocado is amazing!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food is delicious, lines are long but service is fast. Omelettes are pretty small, I was still quite hungry afterward. My friend had the French toast, which had vastly larger portions. All of us really enjoyed the food. Staff is friendly and prompt, and the decor inside looks great. Recommended!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I came her to meet with a friend for a late lunch and  was overall happy with my experience. There was a very nice gentleman that greeted me and provided direction of counter service and pick a seat.  I ordered the Cubano sandwich with black beans. The guy who took my order seemed not so enthusiastic to be there. The sandwich itself was bigger than what I had expected! Bread looked and tasted toasty, but the ham and cheese was lacking in flavor and moisture. We definitely enjoyed the atmosphere of the trees and lights.  Although it was counter service, we were checked on once and our food was bussed for us. Great job!  Good place to grab a bite, a drink or dessert for a reasonable price."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great quick breakfast and lunch spot. Lots of the menu to choose from.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The service was quick and the food was amazing. Everyone was so welcoming. 10/10 would go again!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great service. The wait to order is the longest part but well worth it.  Orange juice tastes freshly squeezed. Perfect poached eggs on the avocado toast! Glad we stumbled upon this place!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Service was fast! And friendly. The atmosphere was very relaxing and I was happy to find a late night eatery.  My menu item was unsatisfactory. Ribs were over cooked, tough, and dry. I didn't care for the rub...seemed like a thick layer of black pepper. The slaw was fresh but the thick slices of cabbages were tough to chew. The sweet potatoes were too sweet. I think they were roasted in syrup. I wasn't sure the wood plates were sanitary."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The owner, or an employee who really loves this restaurant, came up and talked to me in line and suggested the reuben. He said he has been making reubens for 26 year and if I don't like it he'd give me a refund. Well I have to say even with these high expectations the sandwich blew me away, I highly recommend the reuben, best I've had in recent memory! Also their ice tea is served in a large glass which is a huge plus to me :)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food... great atmosphere. I had the eggs benedict with avocado. Very flavorful, and filling. I was not a fan of their coffee.... but i don't think that would be a reason not to go back. It might be just a difference in expectation of flavor. I wold go back.  Advice to all the non locals... sit inside, you don't want people to look at your dish as they walk on the sidewalk.. some stop by and smell your dish(part of the local homeless problem). Service was great too. 2 people came up to ask if all was good."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"What a great experience! When we checked in to our hotel we asked about restaurant recommendations and The Grove was their suggestion. Score! These people know how to do ""regular"" food in a unique way. Order the ""Dave's Way"" Eggs Benedict....avocado and bacon! Something for everyone. We returned twice....and brought friends. The Grove has mastered ""moving"" people without you feeling pushed. The atmosphere is casual with lots of actual reclaimed wood...flooring, benches, table and three massive dead trees wrapped in lights. There's a big fireplace with a wood fire burning, outdoor seating and seating in a loft area. Feels like a very, very old pub. Easy walking from the Marriott Marquis. Saturday and Sunday mornings there was a line out the door but we were surprised at how quickly it moved. You order, get a number and they bring it to your table. The Grove is cozy and warm, and a very friendly and efficient place. Oh, and child friendly! Wonderful coffee too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good food and atmosphere, setup was a little confusing but we figured it out. Fresh made lemonade is very good."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food is good but drinks are overpriced and there's no wifi.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A top 5 star eating experience at the heart of San Francisco. Avocado toasts, breakfast burrito and french toasts with freshly squeezed orange juice are my favourites!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"If I could only base this review on the food, I would give it a 5. I took it down to a 3 because of the transparency of the info they have on the listing. They list ""dine-in"" as an option, but for the time being, I think they should change it to takeaway and delivery only.  They have a large indoor seating area that was closed, so you have to order at an outdoor window (ordering at a counter is not a problem for me).  They give you a pager when your food is ready, so when that flashes, you go to another outdoor window where they give you all your food and drinks in bags, paper cups, and plastic containers (yes, they are all compostable and recyclable - so that is a plus)  There is outside seating that is less than ideal and I witnessed several customers who would take up larger tables and sit to drink a cup of coffee or work on a laptop. I can respect that it is not the responsibility of the staff to ask their customers to leave if they are finished, but I have a feeling if you had to wait to be seated inside, the hostess would sit a single person at a 2 person table, not a 5 or 6 person table. Also, the staff did not step out of the restaurant the whole time we were at an outdoor table, so they probably didn't realize that customers with food had a hard time finding a place to sit and eat.  Once you find a place to sit outside and eat your food, which is very good considering it's in a plastic dish, you now have to clear your plates and silverware into the trash, compost, and recycle bins.  Gosh, I sound like a big complainer about this, but again, if I knew at the beginning of this outing that it would be more of a ""food truck"" experience I wouldn't be having these feels about spending over $100 for a family of 4 for breakfast."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A great brunch, with fresh squeezed OJ mimosas.  Tasty eggs, bacon, salads. Great location across the street from SFMOMA."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was excellent and served very quickly. The mimosa was almost undrinkable though, extremely sour. They use fresh squeezed oranges so I might have just gotten unlucky."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food and great service. even though there was a line they got us in quick (within 4-5 minutes). Food was delicious and the fresh squeezed orange juice was good too.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Ribs were very flavorful, and the omelette was so light and fluffy.  Hashbrowns were an amazing side dish too, very crunchy and tasted lovely. Service was good too. Overall an amazing place and my first 5 stars anywhere in the world. Will definitely be back!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Amazing breakfast food. Great coffee. Quick service and an excellent atmosphere. The interior design and unique seating makes for a unique experience.  Staff is friendly. A bit pricey (it is SF after all) but the portions are generous, so it's well worth it."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Top Notch.. Sunday Brunch.  Expect a line.  Hi-End Eats.  Worth the wait.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Went out for a bike ride decided to stop for lunch I must say we made a good choice
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is a partial review because I haven't been to Grove for a full meal experience yet.  I have picked up delivery orders from here and had their delicious pie a la mode. 😋  The pies are amazing. I have a hard time going by the place without stopping for a slice. I recommend getting it with ice cream or a la mode, if you're trying to impress someone. The place always looks clean and organized even though it gets quite busy. That can be said for all of the locations. Compliments to the staff for handling it well.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Orders come out on time for most part.  Overall, Grove has a nice homely vibe. A part of the community."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent food! We ate here a couple of times on our trip! Very busy on weekends, but worth the wait... quieter during the week. Staff are very nice and the owner is personable and makes sure everyone is enjoying their meal. Clean restaurant and ample outdoor seating."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Tomato in chilli is raw and not cooked enough. Food is warm but not hot. Nothing special about any dish , seasoning or ingredients."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Stayed at The W around the corner and went here two nights in a row. The food was delicious, staff are friendly, and the restaurant was clean. Fast casual counter service concept and the food is a great value. Beef short ribs are amazing. The carrot cake was worth the price! I assume all of their pastries are."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was amazing. Service was great. SF feel, local fresh ingredients. Fun decore. Loved it!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Best breakfast/brunch place, avocado toast is the best along with fresh orange juice! There was a long queue to be seated but we were able to get a seat in like 10-15 mins. must visit breakfast place!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had a very fun open atmosphere,  counter service with plenty of seating. Staff was prompt and friendly.  Food was very good."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food. Friendly staff. Cappuccino USD 4.5 is worth it.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Came in for breakfast to get their breakfast burrito to-go. Didn't expect it to be that big! It's really delicious, and they include some fresh pico de gallo. Could benefit from some hot sauce, too ;)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice place to sit and chat.. went here with my team after work.. had a fun gathering
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Delicious, fun, and superb customer service. You get the sense that they really care about the customer. Food was very good, I had the breakfast tacos and my date had some sort of eggs benedict. But the best part... Was the hash browns, they've got to be in my top five all time! Enjoy."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Benedict, breakfast burrito, and french toast are all tasty. Staff are friendly and willing to help if it's your first time. I got there right when they opened Sunday morning - the line blew up shortly after."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Stopped here twice during our trip. My wife and I both got cheeseburgers (I added bacon) with chips the first time and it was really good. Fresh ingredients, juicy beef, and great flavor. Went in 2 days later for breakfast and got the New Yorker breakfast sandwich. The pastrami was good, but most of it was grizzle and fat so I ended up discarding over half of it and had basically an egg and cheese sandwich in the end. Each trip was north of $40 for my wife and I. Her breakfast burrito was very well made and big enough that we could have split it. Service is excellent.  Though the pastrami was disappointing, I'd go back again if I was in the area."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Im from out of town. I stumbled upon this place. Food came out quick. It was pretty solid. Not bad at all. Nothing amazing and stand out either. I’d go back, but not top of my list."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very bad customer service especially those who work with to go orders. They are really rude with customers
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of my favorite brunch spots in all of San Francisco, it has slowly become one of my Sunday traditions. Abel at the door always greets customers with a friendly smile and killer recommendations. Breakfast all-day is absolutely key, I'd recommend the Breakfast special. Also in an awesome location, right in front of the Yerba Buena center. It's order at the counter style but you grab a number so a server can find you later on. It's got a great atmosphere, highly recommend for any occasion!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Beautiful and cozy cafe with tons of seating. Their hot chocolate is really sinful! My friend and I could barely share a slice of red velvet cake between us after having the hot chocolate. Their food menu looks good too. I'll try it next time.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The famous hash browns weren’t recognizable as potatoes, and one of two sandwiches was very meh. The service was good  but based on the food, I’m a little surprised at the ratings. Maybe our experience was an aberration?"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"As described by reviews. Excellent food. Great atmosphere, stylish/posh layout and floor plan. The menu is bright and easy to read. Staff here is polite and well dressed. This was our first visit and we’ll most definitely come back. I can’t imagine there being a better place to enjoy a Sunday brunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Absolutely delicious eggs Benedict with side salad. Easy, casual and high quality food with friendly service."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great spot, lots of cool SF history throughout. Two floors. Just a cool fun spot, would go again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"After a day of fully walking all over San Francisco we had here lunch, great food and cozy place, service was good!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Always nice service and tasty food. The portions are very generous 😁 …
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I usually try not to rate a place off a one off, but this needs to be said. I tried the breakfast special to go and was beyond disappointed. Not only was the food mediocre, but the portion size for the price just wasn't worth it. The bacon was okay, the eggs were super small, and the hash browns (if you can even call it that) were a mess. Maybe if I had ordered in, I would gotten something for my money?  Overall you'll have better luck hitting up your local waffle house, and to San Francisco's equivalent your local Denny's."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Friendly staff.  Very welcoming.  Great food with lots to choose from.  Pot pie was yummy. Even a picky eater loved it!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food is pretty good (but portions can be extremely large depending on what you order), however service is always lacking here. In the multiple times I've visited I have had dirty plates and dishes, forgotten food, and mimosas made with only the tiniest drop of sparkling wine. Good if you don't mind the poor service and stick to drinking beer."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Really great place - we were walking from the MoMa to union square when we found this place for lunch. We had the breakfast burrito, the chicken sandwich and the grove Reuben and they were all fantastic. Would definitely visit again if I come back to SF."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Staff were so friendly, before we were even in the building we were greeted with a menu and told how and where to order. Food was wonderful, I had the Eggs Benedict with avocado and bacon, as well as a watermelonade. Very cute and comfortable inside. I was with a large group and even though it was crazy busy, we all sat together."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good tasting breakfast omelet and coffee but the portion size was small compared to other local restaurants in the area. Good atmosphere but the staff needs to do something about the wobbly tables, I've eaten here at least 6 times over the years and everytime I'm sitting at the tables, (the small square ones) my drink splashes over the top because when you place your  forearms on the table it rocks back and fourth, very annoying. The management needs to install small adjustments tips on the legs to fix this problem."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great atmosphere and a wide variety on the menu. It can get really busy but it’s well worth it.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Good food and casual atmosphere.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Such good breakfast food. We got the breakfast sandwich and then also eggs benedict. Switch out for a biscuit (trust me). Also must try the orange juice
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,My $26 dollar breakfast burrito was pretty ok!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Everything was amazing! The atmosphere was cozy and the decor was cute. The chicken pot pie was the best I've ever had, the dressing for the side salad was delicious, and the chicken wings were seasoned to perfection. I would highly recommend it to everyone!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Delicious and good price
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Delicious homemade-style American breakfast fare. The only downside was the pricing. For example, adding a slice of ham to my avocado toast was $3.75 and a side of bacon was $5.25..."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This has to be my favorite breakfast place in San Francisco!  The food is outstanding and it doesn't matter what you get; it's all fresh and delicious. The coffee is solid; I like it black and boring but the taste was great. Highly recommend if you are in the area.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Wow! The French dip sandwich is spectacular! Best I've ever had hands down. The tortilla soup is great too. One of my favorite meals ever! Favorited!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great salads, craft beers, wonderful service"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove was a real surprise. For a place that you have to order at the counter, this was easily  the best place I ate at during my stay in San Francisco. My friend ordered chicken wings for an appetizer and they were perfect. Everything from the seasoning to how they were cooked. So good.  The menu is all day breakfast plus salads and burgers. I had ribs and they were some of the best I've ever had.  The only drawback is that there is no waitstaff. You go up to the counter for everything even a second beer.  That makes it a little inconvenient, but unless you are there during a Google convention with 30k extra people in the area, it is probably not a problem."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great Ambiance, great food! The avocado toast was made perfectly! And the sour cherry pie was out-of-this-world delicious that. Especially if you like tart desserts.  Getting a table sometimes challenging, but if you wait something always opens up."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Delicious, fresh breakfast is served all day here, and that's generally when we visited. (They also have plenty of lunch/dinner items.) The restaurant is charming, with lots of wood including several large tree trunks wound with sparkling lights for a gracious, cozy, natural ambience. In the morning expect a hefty line for breakfast early, but later on (after about 8:00-8:30am) there's usually not a wait on weekdays as the work crowd disperses. It's a little chilly inside since the door's usually open, so bring a jacket or wrap if needed. I love the eggs hollandaise with salmon, but their breakfast sandwiches are also scrumptious. The house coffee is also great, and tends toward the bright, fruity side, and of course refills are free. The staff is wonderful, and in fact when I picked up breakfast to take out, they offered to refill my coffee while I waited (which wasn't even a long time, to be fair). My wife and I just started going here every morning because it was so enjoyable, even at the cost of exploring other breakfast joints. It's not dirt cheap, but the quality is more than worth it. We had a large breakfast together with breakfast for around $40 before tips."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We had the best breakfast here! Even though it was during the early morning rush, they know how to manage crowd control. Our food was fresh, delicious, and fast! The coffee and our service was on point, too! I highly recommend to anyone and want to go back!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Such a wonderful restaurant. The acacado toast was delicious! Love the atmosphere inside with the tree trunks and lights. Go early or plan to wait in a long line as this place seems to be a local favorite!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had breakfast. Delightful setting.  Little noisy for a quiet conversation, but fun watching heading to work.  Staff very attentive and helpful.   Breakfast tacos were good.  I like spicy.   They were a little bland but there salsa and Taptio perked them up.  Steak was tender. Easy walking distance from Market Street and Palace Hotel. When back in SF, will definitely be looking up The Grove again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place was a very pleasant surprise!! Coffee is great, strong but not overly bitter. Now, I had the New Yorker breakfast sandwich with their house made pastrami and let me tell you, I would have licked my plate if I weren't in public. The rosemary hash browns added more moaning and eye rolling pleasure while I ate. Crispy but not burnt. Tasty without having to add salt. I highly recommend trying this place!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Eggs Benedict was not bad, but didn't blow me away either. The bread of the English muffin was tough and doughy. The egg was a little cold, but tasted good. There wasn't a lot of spinach and portobello mushroom, but the flavor of both were pretty good. The dish came with rosemary hash browns, which were not bad.Overall, the food was good-fair, but a little pricey"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The food was alright but my orange juice was warm. I ate my food and all day felt sick. Had to make myself throw up just to feel better. It was all orange juice. Freshly squeeze is great but how long was it sitting out to be warm?
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Delicious food. Chicken tortilla soup was excellent as well as the Cobb salad! I substituted blue cheese dressing for their green dressing and it was EXCELLENT!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great good.   Arrived at 715 am,ordered and had food by 730 am.  Coffee is very tasty ... they brew Verve.  Good quality capucinno too. Avocado toast is decent but not standout.  Pastrami sandwich is amazing! Several staff members checked on us during our meal... nice touch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Short ribs was very tender and tasty. Portions are on the small size though.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Saw the great reviews and needed a breakfast to get us ready for the road trip. Huge cups of coffee, cool vibes, food wasn't all that and little small on the portions. Granola and fruit were good. Weird ordering and food pick system that doesn't really seem to keep the line moving."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Awesome service, delicious food, super atmosphere!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"It was fine. My chicken pot pie came out with some cold spots, but I waited a few minutes and the temperature evened out. Tasted a little funny though.  Went back a couple of years later and had a very good bacon cheeseburger."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food was okay, but my avocado toast barely had avocado on it, it was a thin layer and I could see the bread under it. But what disappointed me was that while I was waiting in line I asked an employee what he recommended and he said the burrito is really popular but that it's large and ""not for a woman"", and that I should order something lighter as women should eat smaller meals."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great wings and loved the ribs.  Very nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Warm and cordial service. The breakfast burrito was fantastic. So was the freshly squeezed orange juice. I was the only one sat outside with a couple of friends and the service staff still made effort to come and check in to make sure we didn't need anything. 10/10 will go again.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Love the ambience in here. My friend and I sat in two comfortable, leather, grandpa chairs wit two little tv tables. Service was speedy and friendly. The decor of the place was very cozy. I like that the sausage was jus chicken and not chicken apple. Good job. The portions were large.  I took one star away because the breakfast tacos did not bring the black beans they said it would, the hash browns were a bit crunchy and my French toast was served on a like sliced bread roll. That was kinda weird."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Atmosphere: very laid back, you order at the counter and sit with a number until they bring you your food. Food quality: Sub-par and expensive. I ordered their wings (which I wouldn’t do again because I got 6 wings for $9)and they came out cold, flavorless and still had a bit of hair from the chicken on them. I ordered the cup of veggie chilly which seemed to be less than a cup of chilly. This was probably the only thing I liked. Service: average. Suggestions for the business: make your chicken wings more flavorful and take another look at those prices, $4-5 for a cup of tea is slightly absurd."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very nice restaurant. Staff is super friendly and no matter how packed it is, it's always fast.  The Food is good but options might be a bit limited (maybe I find it repetitive as I've been there many many times).  The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's a bit overpriced for what you get. After being there an average of 2 a week for the last 6 months, they still charged me over $3 for a few slices of bread to dunk in my ribs sauce..."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I don't understand why this place is 4.4. My friend and I ordered The Breakfast Special and the tomato and basil soup. The food already came out when I was waiting for my coffeen right after I ordered. The soup was okay but pricey for what you get and the breakfast special was extremely disappointing! It was a really SPECIAL COLD breakfast. The poached eggs and bacon were cold and even hash browns was cold and nasty. I felt like they made it all in advance and just delivered it when people order. I didn't like the atmosphere neither and the food is way to expensive than what it is.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"When I walked in it seemed a little crowded. We order anyways and sat down at one of the two open tables inside. I believe there was upstairs seating also. There is outdoor seating too. Food came relativity quick for how many customers were there! I liked that. I ordered a Denver omelette and it was wonderful. The ham wasn't that fake cubed ham, it was sliced and fresh. Potatoes were good, wish there was a little more to the portion of egg. Came with sourdough toast. I enjoyed it.  tldr; crowded area even though the place seems big. Food is a little pricy, but it is San Francisco so no big deal. Food came fast and tasted great. Overall, if you can afford it and don't mind the crowd, definitely a place to eat!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,We saw the great menu I'm the pictures here. Unfortunately they have changed the menu and the options for kids are no longer there. We really wanted to try the food but can't if they remove all the options for kids.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great spot, decent food and nice people."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This place is quite nice.  Located close to the convention center for easy access.  Great food options with a sprawling menu.  Orange juice is great and fresh squeezed.  I had the french dip which was a bit on the salty side but still excellent (and portion was more than I could handle).  It gets a little crowded during a convention so just keep that in mind.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good service, nice place to seat and relax your meal with a good cup of coffee."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Customer service was excellent. Staff assured that customers were satisfied and felt welcome. Nice outdoor seating with fairy lights, as well as seating upstairs. Food was well priced and delicious. Our meal was delivered in a timely manner. Will definitely visit again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great coffee and good food ! Excellent service
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast before heading back to the east coast.  There was a line out the door... Always a good sign. My husband had spinach, fontina, and tomato omelette and I ordered the basil and goat cheese omelette.  Both were fantastic! Beautifully decorated with ample comfy seating."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great spot for breakfast, fast service and friendly staff."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Perfectly poached egg, solid avocado toast. Hash browns were just ok"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Amazing breakfast sandwhich! Had to eat here daily during a work conference in San Francisco
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Lady on the phone hung up on me - Saturday June 17, 2023 8:34AM"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Tasty oven fried portobello burger, terrible latte"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The last three times I've been in town on business, I've made sure to visit here at least once. It's delicious, dependable, and almost never crowded on a week night. The portions are just right too! I especially recommend the avocado toast, the Denver scramble, and the black tea sangria."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I've been here for late night food a couple of times, years apart, and have really enjoyed it both times.  Sometimes you just want a breakfast burrito for dinner. The Grove has you covered!  The food and drink options are great. The decor is pretty cool, and so is the layout of the building itself."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Even though some friends scoff at this place because it's a ""chain"" (oh the horror) - I love it! Great selection, and their salads are all delicious. Served in wooden bowls with homemade dressing - the Berkeley Bowl or Chicken Apple Salad with Acme bread on the side. My favorite thing to pick up to go if needed one day after work, or to enjoy in their outdoor seating area. Breakfast items are also great!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Fantastic menu. Fantastic staff. Fantastic food. Fantastic ambiance. Fantastic experience. I love soup and got the chicken soup. It was...you guessed it, fantastic! The omelets and bread were...you guessed it, fantastic! Worth the wait on any day. Try and get the crows nest to sit and enjoy your meal while watching the entire restaurant."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great atmosphere, good food, unique style of restaurant.  I would highly suggest their club sandwich made from real turkey.  One of, if not the best, turkey club sandwiches I've ever had.  Every time I visit San Francisco I make sure to go here.  I gave only 4 stars however due to the price.  It's fairly expensive for just about anything on the menu."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Best eggs Benedict I've ever had. And I try them many places!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Was in town for a convention and found this place for lunch. It is a quirky little space that was fun. I had the Berkeley Bowl which was fairly good, even if the dressing was a bit heavy. It falls into the fast casual range. You order at the counter and take a number and find a seat and someone will bring you out your order."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Beautiful cafe in the financial district that does a great breakfast. I love all of the multi-colored lights they have wrapped around the structure as well as the vaulted ceiling that gives it a very spacious feel. They have homemade jam in bounty, they make a great coffee and their desserts are decadent. The prices are pretty reasonable and there always seems to be seating available."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, great ambience, great staff and enjoy the music."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Wish I could give it 4.5 stars. The atmosphere is very social with cool decor, and the food was delicious for the most part. Both my and my partners potatoes were poorly cooked, however, which would seem like the most simple and easy part of the dish. May come back for breakfast tomorrow, though!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Saw the good reviews and tried it out. Went yesterday but a pipe had burst and they weren't serving. Had an Americano today. Very strange taste and murky appearance - maybe it was just different coffee beans than I'm used to. Also served in a chipped cup. Fairly long wait for food to come out also. Food was good though. As others have mentioned, ordering system is a bit odd."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food and service has me wanting to return to San Francisco just to come here. I had the eggs Benedict with fried catfish, and grits. My daughter had the French toast and chocolate beignets."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Updated review on 2/13/18 Food quality seems to have gone down significantly over the years. My order of an avocado toast with eggs was not fresh, the toast was soggy, and the hash browns still hapf-frozen. Never going back again.  --------  Amazing food and ambience, and great service! You really wouldn't mind the wait."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Really nice people excellent customer service and food
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Best breakfast I've ever had in the city. Amazing atmosphere, wonderful customer service, excellent food. We had the brioche French toast with caramalized bananas, and eggs benedict with avocado and bacon... So so good. Plus, they serve Verve coffee here! Prices were reasonable, especially for SF!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Met up with friends for brunch of a beautiful morning. This is a very popular place on mission, but they get through the line (out the door!) Shockingly quick. They have a variety of drink - boozy and basic, to get you in the zone for brunch. Full menu of either entrees or breakfast. Can definitely satisfy many different types of eaters!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great food but very very busy in the mornings. Suggest to get there the minute it opens up.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Love the food here. Went to San Fran for business for 5 days and ate here 3 times. Loved the Tuna sandwich, Chicken pot pie and the traditional eggs Benedict. Food is priced well especially for the area, and everything tasted great and was fresh!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Dottie, Abel & Jerry are the best!!! Give them a raise"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Low-key cafe-style (order and pay at the register before you find a seat, they'll bring the food out) restaurant with great food, drinks and dessert. Tonight we tried the chicken tortilla soup, grilled cheese with tomato soup and a kid's pasta with cheese. Everyone was very happy with the service, quality, taste and the vibe."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Wouldn't give us a few more sticks of raw veggies to go with the large pot of houmous they provided without paying for a second order of the houmous, because it was on the happy hour menu."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Adorable outdoor seating and delicious food. Seating is close together, so if you are worried about being close, I wouldn't recommend their outdoor seating. Takeout and delivery are great options though!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was quite delicious at this local chain. I ordered the Rancheros and my friend ordered her usual-- the breakfast sandwich and a latté. My food came a little chilly (I think because of the cool atmosphere of the restaurant) but was quite delicious. Only complaint is I could have used more tortilla chips. Perks: fast service, an expedited line facilitated by the staff, and availability to charge a phone or laptop if you sit in specific areas. Would visit again to try something new. I also heard someone order hot chocolate-- which is one of my favorite beverages."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,What a find. Spending the weekend from Dallas and wanted a quick but local breakfast. Arrived around 10am to find less than a 10 minute wait. Liked the concept of standing in line to order and then find a seat. Eclectic selection of seating. Food and atmosphere was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. Will be back as soon as possible.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of the best breakfast places around the Moscone center, recommended"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Once you figure out the mechanics at work (check the menu, go up and order, take your number, food/utensils comes out to your table) it's a very nice, friendly, low key establishment. The food was very tasty, the 🍺 (I had a kolsch) was too.  I'd come back, either solo as I was, or with a group, whenever I wanted a hassle free brunch lunch situation, without a doubt."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food and coffee were cold and the prices were way to high as the food was so bad, wouldn’t recommend or go again"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food was great. I have the grilled cheese with bacon and lavender lemonade, and my daughter had the BLT and a large chocolate chip cookie. Everything was Seasons well and just. Pleasing to the palate. The only downfall to this was the meal was quite expensive."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My new go to for breakfast in downtown! Delicious breakfast food, nice restaurant feel, reasonable prices especially for downtown SF, what more could you want. Bit of a line but it moves quickly. Bread is especially delicious, in both grilled and french toast forms."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is a SF chain that serves a wide variety of breakfast and lunch options as well as beer, wine, and some limited alcohol.  This place isn't fancy but it is always packed, the food isn't bad and service is generally quick.  Its an order at the counter and take a number kind of place but doesn't feel cheap.  Its got a unique, casual vibe and usually a ton of people hanging out drinking coffee and eating brunch.  Fun spot if you are in the area and need to burn some time or grab a quick bite."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Popular place for breakfast - even on a weekday. The food is a little plain (I had the breakfast burrito, which was also a bit difficult to eat - too big to pick up and too messy to eat comfortably with a knife and fork). Their coffee beverages are good, and the ambiance is nice / casual. I would probably come here again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,My friend always takes me here because she knows that the food won't make me sick. I have a sensitive tummy so i am picky. Foods amazing even simple things like grilled cheese. Very pricey but expected for the location. Staff are super nice even though it's busy so it's good.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Order at the counter and pay, and they bring your food to you at a table. Food was good, with large portions, but the guy at the entrance was a little rude about not sitting at a table to look at the menu before we ordered"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Came here for Saturday morning breakfast.  The entire staff are a Godsend. Abel, the supervisor, personally greeted us and gave us some top notch recommendations since this was our first time at The Grove.  The ambience is perfect and the seating inspires you to get to know your neighbor with the excellent food as a branching point. I absolutely recommend the American Ham and Gruyere Omelet, the French Toast, and Poached Eggs. Their jam is a must for their bread as well.  I'll be stopping here anytime I'm in SF!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Just great brunch food and service as well.  The gentleman, Abel, at the door suggested the chicken sandwich which was outstanding.  Also Elie the manager couldn’t have been more hospitable."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great for breakfast. Lots of options, food is delicious and a good price, with large portions. It's always busy but the line moves fast (you have to order at the counter) and I'm usually at the front before I've finished choosing what I want. Lots of seating and a nice atmosphere too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Amazing salads, fast and friendly service."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had breakfast and lunch here. Breakfast sandwich was great, though the coffee was a little weak. Crispy chicken sandwich at lunch was delicious too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Their freshly squeezed orange juice is out of this world! Food was amazing as well. I had their Ranchero Steak and Eggs and was not disappointed. The line was pretty long (out the door) when I went, and for good reason! Next time I'm in SF, I'm definitely coming back."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was delicious, sat outside and it was a lovely experience. Waitress was very attentive and came by frequently to see if we needed anything."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food was delicious and was ready SO fast. The breakfast burrito is ginormous. Our server was also amazing and attentive.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food was okish.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food at this place is great but the staff is what makes it exceptional. I came here with a co-worker for lunch while on business travel. Given the notoriously long lines in the area for lunch, we were thrilled to get a table immediately. Unfortunately, due to the lunch rush, the kitchen ran out of pastrami after we had already ordered their infamous Reuben.  The manager came to our table and offered us anything we wanted off the menu. We ended up with a couple French dip sandwiches (delicious) and he added in soups for us to try. Feeling genuinely bad about running out of a meat during a busy time, he went out of his way to make it right.  My colleague and I stayed a while chatting about work. Before we left the kitchen had finished making more pastrami. Lo and behold, management offered us the Reubens we had originally ordered. In an age where restaurants are becoming entitled to business and overpacked establishments don't even have time to look you in the eye, The Grove goes above and beyond. There's true compassion and customer service here; a rarity these days in the restaurant industry. I'm looking forward to visiting The Grove again next time I'm in town."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, great atmosphere, at a good price."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,delicious! omg the inside of the restaurant is beautiful and you can eat upstairs and look out into the whole restaurant. beautiful! and the food 🤤 i ordered the fruit platter with french toast and we also got a lavender lemonade and it was sooo good! it was refreshing and cool. definitely recommend for family or a date ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) …
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We loved this place so much we went back twice! There's something magical about this place, it oozes San Francisco. From the craft brews on tap to the delicious but not too fancy foods, you're sure to find something here.  The atmosphere is laid back, the music is great, and so is the grilled cheese!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We stumbled upon this place on our way back to our hotel after a long day walking the city.  We struggled to find a decent place for dinner with the kids.  This was a winner.  Cool atmosphere, very fair prices and the food was really good.  I had a great salad and there were good menu items for the kids."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had the ""crispy"" chicken sandwich which is a glorified chicken nuggets on bread. $17 then added bacon for $2.50 which was soggy and stringy. There was very little to the sandwich.  Not worth the price, the food was decent at best."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Amazing dishes with so many of your favorites. Food quality was top notch!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of my favorite breakfast and lunch eateries when visiting San Francisco. I'm a fan of the tomato basil soup, avocado toast and fresh squeezed orange juice. The juicer is always running, it seems. Great ambiance. Line goes fast."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Yummy food, classic American style menu. Dog friendly, they even have treats. Good fresh juices. They have beer.  Good for groups who want separate tabs because you can order individually at the counter and sit together."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This was my second visit of the restaurant. I ordered an Egg Benedict and a cup of coffee for my breakfast. The food was good until I found 3 pieces of broken egg shells inside the eggs. I didn't complain as I took it as a careless mistake. Later on, I was approached by a member of staff who normally asked if everything was ok. I hesitated....and decided to tell him the truth of how I felt. He looked at the egg shells on the plate and acknowledged it. Probably feeling a bit embarrassed, he never returned to do any service recovery. Totally disappointed with the service standard.  Customer service and satisfaction are not valued."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove has sadly changed a lot and not for the better. The quality of the bread/toast, the taste of the coffee, the portions, the hash browns. It's still a lovely space and the staff are great but they have clearly needed to find cost savings and it shows."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Hit the spot. Seriously. Spot hitter. Had the breakfast burrito w/apple sausage and the lady ordered french toast, bomb also. Place has a super chill vibe, warm atmosphere, and was very clean. A bit pricier for breakfast, but well worth it. I recommend you try it...yes you reading this very review, just decide to trust me and tell whomever you are with that you guys are going to The Grove."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, and unique atmosphere. Prime rib is a must!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I thought the people and atmosphere was great and the food had so much potential but my poached eggs were not hot, slightly undercooked and the avocado was extra cold and the English muffin could have been toasted so it was at least a bit crispy. Concept was great but cooking needed improvement"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food has never disappointed. I love all of their salads but this is a great place to bring people for a casual meal when you aren't sure what they like. They have such a wide selection and everything is delicious. They also serve beer and wine, which is a nice addition to this fast-casual spot."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very sour coffee!!!! Had to ask for another one that wasn't full of grounds. Server wasn't very receptive. Overall I got decent service. Food was good but a little overpriced. Fruit was fresh, latte was pretty good. A good stop but nothing Is be coming back for. Had to get a cup of coffee elsewhere!!!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Fantastic ambience, very nice (and heated!) outdoor seating. The food has been great every time I've been, and the coffee/desserts are great as well. I make it a point to come here every time I'm in SF!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Easy walk from union square. If you have a large group get there early for weekend breakfast to get a large table. We watched it go from no line at 8am to a large line at 8:45. I had the granola with yogurt and fruit, so yummy! We will go again next time we are staying in the city."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice cozy spot for breakfast. Dave's way is the only way for the Benny!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Pretty good food. The seating could be improved upon. I understand that two people shouldn't take a table designed for four..... But when couples are sitting at the coffee counter while there are 8 open 4-person tables??
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,A very San Francisco eating experience. We went for breakfast and there was a line as they don't take reservations. It .oves quickly and you eventually order at a counter and they give you a number. Coffee drinks are picked up from a different window. The cafe mocha was outstanding and it is a huge cup. The eggs Benedict was also very good. Seating is up to you to figure oiut and many of the tables are tiny and in weird spots. All in all a freaky weird SF experience but with good food!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I like the decor in this location. The fake trees and huge fire place transport you to a cabin in the Sierras. Service was good, and my family and I got our food quickly. The major issue I had was the portion size.  Compared to the Hayes Valley location, the portions at this location are small! My dad ordered the tomato/fontina scramble that came with spinach.. There was only one piece of spinach and the eggs took up a quarter of the plate. The hashbrowns that came with my Benedict were barely a handful, and that was the case with the salad that came with my sister's avocado/egg toast.  Also, we ordered orange juice but the glasses were warm which ended up warming the juice. I got the cranberry sangria which was delicious.  My family and I ate here because it was New Year's Day and not many places were open. But if given the chance again, I wouldn't eat here. I'd rather travel the one mile to their other location and get bigger portions at the same price."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"AMAZING breakfast food. Great environment and staff. They were really excited and friendly. After my first time there, I went a second time because it was so good. Breakfast burrito was my favorite!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,One of the best spots for breakfast or lunch in the city. The staff here seriously knows what excellent customer service means.  Very attentive. Very friendly. DO NOT let the line scare you. It’s always busy but amazingly fast. They absolutely have a system figured out.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Amazing and delicious. Fantastic food and service. The people who work there really care about the food and your experience. Super friendly. Very reasonable prices and food was so fresh. By far the best breakfast and lunch place in the neighborhood. Had the breakfast burrito and it was huge and stuffed with all the yummies you would want. Fresh squeezed OJ and excellent coffee. A must visit when in the area!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Beautiful vibe and ambience. Great food to start the day with.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We’ve visited The Grove three times last week and it became our favorite place for breakfast. I tried Eggs Benedict, Avocado toast and Morning Burrito. All where good and tasty Vibe is nice and comfy, with plenty of room for both eating and catching up with work on a laptop. One thing that was missing is a WiFi network named The Grove. So I found a close by network and used that instead."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had the banana crumble bread, which was a little too dry. French toast and french dip sandwich were delicious though. Cool atmosphere, will return."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I love brunch, but was slightly disappointed in the Grove compared to other places nearby.  The food was pretty good and tasted fresh, but pretty pricy for drinks considering the level of service.  Service isn't bad, just not tableside - you go up to a line to order so I'd expect the prices to be a little lower.  It was fast though compared to when we went for dinner - we waited quite awhile then for the food to come out.  In short, very good food but not best value."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The pastrami was excellent, but the attached salad came without dressing and was bland... thankfully, because as it turned out because there was an active green inch WORM squirming around on it! Had the salad been good I probably would've eaten the worm as I was busy talking. I've never gotten a worm in my food, but it things happen so I wasn't revolted by it. Plus it was a cute little green worm, not a maggot. The the worst part was that the waitress just said she would tell the chef about it and that was the last I heard. No apology, shock or concern from anyone at the restaurant. It was hushed under the rug and we were ignored after that. I wasn't going to demand a manager or request a refund and ruin the atmosphere just to get back my $20 lunch refunded. But some kind of acknowledgement would've increased my rating and respect for this place. This is just another example of how some businesses, like The Grove, thrive only because of their trendy appeal to tourists and locals, but don't care about individual customers. Too bad, because I could (and did) forgive  the green worm on a plate of greens, but not the indifference of the employees had about it."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I went here with a friend in the early evening for some hot Early Grey tea.  My friend had a hot chocolate with a generous portion of whipped cream on top.  I like this place with the big trees and the string of lights--it's like being on a stage set.   The music was a bit distracting that day, but listenable.  I don't remember them playing music the last time I was there.  It started to fill up quickly will the Happy Hour and after-work crowd."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The hotel is super nice but they charge for WiFi use. Guests shouldn't have to see these additional charges after everything else you are subjected to pay for.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Tried this place and it's pretty decent value. Though, you get what you pay for. We went there on a Saturday night and while the place was not too busy none of their standard food (Mac & cheese, chicken hot pie, even mashed potatoes, etc) was available anymore... The meal we eventually ordered came in very large portions although they certainly won't get famous for their cuisine: pretty average taste."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great breakfast, the Eggs benedict ""Dave's way"" was delicious and filling.  My wife ordered the housemade granola with greek yogurt and it was fantastic.  Great quality in a cool place.  Almost didn't stay because the line was out the door, but you order at the counter and then find a table so the line moved very quickly."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Breakfast was great and I looooved the cucumber ginger spritzer!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food! Here's a little too that isn't posted anywhere: you must place your order BEFORE yoi sit. In other words, you may not save seats while your party is ordering. We had a rude lady remind us of this. Otherwise, staff and food are all 5 stars."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We were lucky enough to have had this place recommended to us. We ate the wonderful, finely judged and well cooked breakfast options. Special mention may be made of the delicious omelettes on which we feasted. Great drinks too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food here is amazing. We went here 3 out of 5 days that we stayed in San fran. Highly recommend the granola and my husband highly recommends the French toast with a side of bacon. The fresh orange and Apple juices were also delicious and coffee one of the best we tried in San Fran. You have to go to this place if you're visiting the city but be sure to go before 9am because it gets super busy and there'll be nowhere to sit!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Excellent.  We will visit again.  Good simple menu.  We ate on the patio.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Excellent food made with fresh ingredients. The widely varied menu is very reasonable, especially for that area. We were able to find a table upstairs for 6 people during a busy lunch time. Highly recommend it."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Hour long wait for a simple take out order! We weren’t the only ones with a long wait either. Food was very good through.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,We had the Eggs Benedict with bacon and avacado and it was absolutely delicious. The beer on tap was also great. Friendly staff and a great atmosphere!! Definitely coming back here again.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Female manager on duty December 30th at 9:30 a.m. couldn’t care less about customers. I ordered French toast to go and had one lady In front of me waiting for her order. Others behind me got their orders as well. So I asked cashier about my order? She turned and took my bag off shelf behind her that apparently had been sitting there for a while but my name had not been called! I questioned her about it and she just ignored me. So I found the manager and informed her that my Order to go had been sitting on the back shelf for quite a while. She rudely snapped at me and said we call names 3 times and you did not answer. I told her I was standing right at the pickup counter and my name had not been called not once! She just walked away! 8 minutes later when I was ready to eat it, a $19 French aToast was cold!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great spot for breakfast and lunch. Menu on the smaller side but they're very good at what they do. During the pandemic it's outside only seating but plenty of spaces to sit.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Eggs Benedict Dave’s style is happy.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Their breakfasts are delicious and the atmosphere is really cool. It's feels like you're outside. They have a neat orange juice machines that takes while oranges, cuts and juices them, so you know it's fresh."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Excellent customer service —exceptional food—amazing atmosphere!!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,OMG this place is always such a treat to visit. Atmosphere is phenominal and the food is amazing and the customer service is always on point.  You can tell they work really hard and pride themselves on getting orders in and food out promptly AND politely.  Outs a great place to people watch if you sit upstairs. Its kings of s small space up there but room for at least 10 people on the balcony. Plus there are 2 private room cubby's of Yukon havea pay off 4 at least that are themed even. Really quite unique.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Honestly, the worst thing about Grove is their food.  I've never really been super impressed by anything I've had here.  It's ranged from not very good to above average, but never jumped any higher than that.  Their iced chai is wonderful, though, and they have amazing desserts.  The decor is great, too.  There's plenty of relaxing space to sit and have a drink or chat with your friends, and the trees inside are just... they're so cool.  If falling for a cheap trick like putting trees in your restaurant makes me a sucker, I guess I'm a sucker.  Just don't try to go here for lunch without being early or late.  It gets cutthroat."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Decent but not great and pretty pricey.  Good service but would not go back. It definitely serves conference attendees well due to its location.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food is always phenomenal here. The staff is very friendly and quick. The line can be intimidating, but moves quickly."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great, warm friendly environment with a wide selection of comfort food.   I came her with friend when visiting a year ago and loved the brunch menu so much I made a point to return my next visit for dinner and was equally pleased."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I've been there three times more, twice for dinner and I've for breakfast and I enjoyed it each time.  It's not a proper restaurant, you need to order at the counter like a fast food but the food will then be delivered to your table.  The food is simple, I think American style."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I stopped here to grab a veg sandwich before work. Hands down the best sandwich I had in my life. So good I had to re-create it at home. Nice staff also. Will be coming back for sure.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"WORST Red Velvet Cake I've ever had! It's a crime they even call it that. The frosting is like cool whip, no cream cheese richness. The cake is dense, dry and dull. Where's the buttermilk? Completely absent! That's what makes the flavor so rich and tantalizing.  Sure she's pretty to look at, they got me there. But take a step back, don't be lured by her beauty, you'll be SOOOO disappointed.  Every bite was terrible. Nothing like traditional Red Velvet. & when you call it RV, there's expectations that need to be met.  This failed at every layer."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Good food, but not many places to sit. Was crowded about lunch time. Some seating not that comfortable. They could do some changes and make more room for folks. Take out would be a good option. Price was reasonable."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Got served spoiled hummus for lunch. (I could taste that it was spoiled - dousing it with garlic does not hide it, Grove people!)  Spent all afternoon in the bathroom...."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove knows how to feed you right. I had the Eggs Benedict and it did not disappoint. Super friendly staff, well worth the trip. I'll be back!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Awesome food!  We had the quiche and eggs Benedict.  Both we very flavorful.  Orange juice is fresh squeezed.  Espresso was the best I had on the trip.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Quick and great food. Oj is fresh and the breakfast plate amazing. Highly recommend this place for a quick bit.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food is delicious. Creative non-alcoholic drinks. Sometimes can be a wait to find a table after ordering. A bit noisy but it is popular. There's a coffee bar inside. Great for breakfast or lunch, and with kids."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The worst French toast that I had in my life! Uploaded some photos for your own judgment! Do they know how to make French toast at all! I was wandering in mission the other day with a friend after yoga class and tried a restaurant (which I won’t name it here) randomly, and had the best French toast. This time I googled the best French toast in San Francisco, and against the harsh rain and waiting line, a thick layer of egg like omelet on a big slice of bread! I will never go back there! There are many good restaurants in SF, not this one!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is my go-to place for breakfast and/or lunch. Quick , inexpensive, food is amazing and atmosphere is great"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Friendly staff, delicious eggs benedict and tomato basil soup, fresh orange juice and superb, spicy bloody mary. Would go again!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I am obsessed with this place. Awesome location, yummy food, great drink selection, and adorable waiters. Try the lavender lemonade or, if you're not a heavy eater, the bruschetta is divine!  It's the perfect place to hang out on one of those rare, gorgeous and sunny, San Francisco days. Outdoor seating, great atmosphere, a favorite go-to spot for downtown chillaxing. A bit pricey ($10- $15) but worth the extra cost."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food was ok, good location was a very popular spot at lunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Instant ""mashed potatoes"", worst piece of meat I've had in a restaurant. Tasted like it had been microwaved. Not a good meal at all."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is a very nice place,  we had for orders and all of us enjoyed their plates,  I personally enjoyed my chicken apple salad,  so clean and yummy. The staff is amazing and keeps checking on every few minutes,  although it was lunch time and the place was packed but the food arrived in a very reasonable time and was delicious,  I recommend."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of my favorite places for a no waiting easy good brunch. Breakfast burritos are delicious as is pretty much everything. I would say the salads are a bit overpriced, but what isn't in SF."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very mediocre. Expensive, but doesn't show for it.  Got coffee mocha, and it reeked of the sugar from the chocolate chips they use to make it, without any of the coffee's bitterness. Basically, utterly disgusting.  The salmon omelet was very average, too — hashbtowns didn't have much oregano to it, and were overcooked.  Plus, I did tip the cashier, but the receipt they print has your card with no tip on it. I guess you aren't really supposed to tip here, because they don't do table service, apart from just bring the food to the number on the table?! You also have to pick you the coffee yourself. I complained that it didn't seem to have the shots, they remade it, brought it back to me, but the lady bringing it back scalded herself with it, and made q comment about it. OK, if you work there, and can't bring the coffee your own workers make without scalding yourself, how are the customers supposed to do that, then?!  Overall, not likely to get back. If I will, don't tip, and certainly don't get coffee mocha."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I want to keep this place a secret. It is indeed like SF's living room. Cute cozy place with plenty of seating upstairs and downstairs. There's a fireplace here and even a HUGE tree indoors with small lights strung all around it. Best date place ever.  The food is on the pricey side and nothing special, but you are paying for the experience. I had the Mexican hot chocolate here and it was divine! Would be perfect for people who just want a quiet place to read or rainy days. <3"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Just had dinner at The Grove in SFO. I had the California Muffaletta with a salad. It was terrific, ham, cheese,  olive spread,  olive oil and balsamic glaze on focaccia. It was fantastic.  The customer service was excellent.  Very attentive staff, they went out of their way to make sure you had a great experience."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Average food, mediocre service. Especially didn’t feel welcome with my dog at all by the bald redshirt server working out front."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had Eggs Benedict.  Not good, especially bad serving something like this in San Francisco.  Bland,factory made, generic muffins, *thin* sliced ham, Hollandaise sauce that wasn't.  Orange juice that was not fresh.  $27?  Never again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Everything we ordered was delicious! The eggs Benedict and breakfast burrito. The minted honey that is served with the fruit platter is so tasty. I could drink it. Love this place and come often!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Eggs Benedict and the avocado toast were delicious 🤤
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,One of the best places to get consistently good food with bring a proper sit down restaurant. Their club sandwich is my favorite. The salads are HUGE.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The grove is a cute neighborhood restaurant on Mission. I love the atmosphere here, as there are often groups of people sitting around and drinking wine or coffee. I’ve been here for lunch during the week and also dinner later at night or on the weekends. This is one of the best places for dinner in the area since many of the other restaurants or cafes are closed after 5pm. The chicken pot pie is fun and I’ve enjoyed the mac and cheese twice, and I’d recommend both of them."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"We went for their ""social hour"" and really enjoyed ourselves. The staff was friendly and helpful. A beer and pretzel were a perfect snack. The pretzel and cheese dip was a favorite of ours. The next time we are in the area, we will definitely stop again."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Worth the (about)40min wait on Sunday morning for brunch! The food is fresh and delicious. The staff is super friendly. Be advised you find your own seating after placing your order and the wait staff look for your order # and serve you your food.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food all smelled good, but my happy hour only involved wine.  Enjoyed the outdoor seating even though it's on busy Mission St. I felt the glasses of wine should have been a dollar less, but all the ones we had were delicious."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"For many years now, this has been my favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in the Yerba Buena area.   Their chicken pot pie is rightfully legendary.  Rosemary hash browns, and amazing ice tea are two other notables."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Best oatmeal I've ever had. Served with walnuts and cranberries, it's great when paired with a hot Americano. The atmosphere is also delightful, and the staff circulated to each patron to check on satisfaction."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Ambience is good. Food is good but not great. You can get the SF vibe as near to union square.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place is amazing! I am eating and watching a full kitchen staff just so on point. They have an influx of ppl from the salesforce conference, with a line out the door and along the sidewalk, and aren't missing a beat! The staff is friendly, the food coming out is hot and delicious, the place is beautiful, and yeah, just wow, so impressed by this place and the people who work here!!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice staff and food. I like the cafe mocha they made.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is great, if a little pricey. Their business model is one I am proud to support, so the extra cost is fine. They have a wide array of items on the menu and do everything well, so don't hesitate here. It's a very solid meal at a reasonablish price."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Loved this plaaace. Perfect (and curious) combination of very nice setting / environment with a ""go order your own food at the counter"" kitchen service, with great food tho. Very comfy and make u feel at ease quick. There's an upstairs too."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I love the groove for breakfast. Great food. Nice atmosphere. Best to get there by 730 to get in and seated fast. The closer to 9 the longer the lines. Big jumps in the lines at 750, 820, and 850"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Ordered to go for dinner last week. The food was excellent! I had a bot sandwich with the spicy mayo on it. Wow it was spicy! But I also opted to have the avocado as well which paired perfectly with it!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"While dining in is a decent enough experience, ordering food for take out is slow.  I sat for almost 20 minutes at 1:45 (not even lunch rush hour) waiting for a tuna melt.  Finally I asked the cashier the name on the bag that had been sitting behind her and -- you guessed it -- it was mine.  Got to the office and my salad was missing from the bag."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"It was busy, but the Grove is so worth the wait."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is always a warm spot for a quick breakfast or lunch.  I find that this location provides a welcome respite from shopping at the Westfield a few blocks away.  Their sandwich combos are great value.  If you're feeling like a little kid (like I so often am), go for the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  And if the weather's nice, snag a table outside and enjoy some people watching!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,So good!  Had the vegetable salad and it was extremely filling and so tasty - gluten free too!  Really kind and helpful staff.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place is great for breakfast. Fun, upbeat atmosphere, for a homespun fast casual meal. the line goes fast and the food comes quick! My cappuccino was perfect. loved it."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I think this restaurant is expensive compared to their food.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I, admittedly, had been making a point of avoiding The Grove, despite suggestions from friends before to meet up here for lunch. The main reason? I'm not a huge fan of hitting up sandwich/soup/salad cafes anymore, honestly. But, my team settled on this spot several weeks back to welcome a new team member, so along I came.  Opting for something a little healthier (though I REALLY wanted the chicken pot pie), I went with their Chinese chicken salad, thinking it'd be similar to the likes you'd find at Souplantation (or Sweet Tomatoes, as it's known to you NorCal kids). While not quite the same, it was a solid and incredibly filling salad - and probably much healthier than what I was hoping it'd be, which I suppose counts as a plus ;)  While I still don't think they'll top my list of lunch joints to frequent, I can at least see them being in the rotation now, whenever I feel like having something a little on the lighter and healthier side. Or, well, when I want to wander in for that pot pie someday...  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - The accessibility of the space is a little mixed, with a variety of tables inside and out, of all shapes and sizes. What it comes down to is, you CAN find accessible seating, but what's available may not be it. And while food is ordered from up front, they do give you a number and bring it out to you, so having to carry your own food shouldn't be a concern.  Bathroom - No comment because I didn't try them."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Still one of my favorite places for chicken pot pie even though the prices continue to climb. The Yerba Buena location is great for people watching outside when the traffic noise isn't too bad. Very friendly staff and great beer and cocktails!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The French toast is amazing. It's made with a bread called batard...try it. It won't disappoint. Oh! It has a custard like taste to it. And make sure you get the carmelized bananas. The young man at the door was very helpful...I think he was new but he faked it very well and gave great suggestions and knew the menu. Way to go new guy! Sincerely,  Visiting from Arizona~"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I'm very disappointed.I spent a lot of money and waited outside for so long.This is the most disgusting  food in San Francisco...Food tasted old ,rice,chicken,salad with old oil,cold croissant, dark tea !"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The portions have shrunk by 50% menu-wide, but still tastes the same. Prices raised. 3 stars for not having to wait..the portion of food you get now is crazy small. Piece of pie half of what they used to serve is 7.95$. Me and my friend were still hungry after 50$ ticket."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Can't go wrong on this one. Waffles, hash browns, eggs benedict, cakes, you name it! Their food is delicious and the crew super friendly! Always a good option for breakfast / brunch at any time of the day."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Tasty food , great service for the city!!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This was a nice surprise for a meal. The decor inside, especially the neon-lit trees, make this place extra enjoyable. The food is good overall, considering the price. Order at the counter and sit where you want (there's an upstairs area)."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, good value. One of the hostesses  did have a creepy vibe and kept staring at our group as we ate. Made a few of us uncomfortable. Apart from that I would highly recommend"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,This was great for breakfast! I had the breakfast sandwich. My gluten free wife was very impressed with the GF bread.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Our go-to place whenever we are visiting SF MoMA. Food and drinks are good and service is phenomenal. Really neat ambiance, we highly recommend if you're in the area!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"DON'T go there if you have any dietary restrictions, and Don't go there even if you don't.  BAD ATTITUDE and POOR SERVICE!  I am on dairy-free diet.  I ordered Tomato and Basil soup, and tasted cream in it, so I notified the waitress.  Then, this obnoxious assistant manager, a thin dark-skinned guy, comes to me and tells me I should have asked what are the ingredients before ordering.  AND he lies to me that ingredients are listed in the menu, which weren't.   My wife ordered some lemon wedges, and the stickers are still on.  Probably, not washed.  When we brought this up, the managers, waitress, and chef gangs up on us to get out of the restaurant with refund.  My wife and I, in 30 plus years of dining out, never had such a bad and rude service.  I posted pictures of lemon with sticker and DIRTY cup.  I hope it goes out of business in few years for people and tourists of SF."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Usually a 5 but tonight out of sour dough bread so no BLT and ribs......  Had already rung me up before finding.  Was nice enough to offer me free dessert too bad I already paid for it so no i have two desserts....  They are really good.  Do get the cherry pie.  Update, no dessert showed up.... moving to 2"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The food was great and the proper cost for the amount they charged :-)
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I loved the restaurant, specially the customer service. The food is great, not cheap but not too expensive either and the experience worth the price. We had breakfast at this place and spent around $30 per person including beverages, taxes and tips."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great, casual place for groups, kids, and they even allow dogs on the patio. The Mac n cheese and roasted brussel sprouts were excellent. Friendly staff. Location is convenient since nearby 2 parking garages & short walk from MoMA, Yerba Buena Park, Metreon just to name a few."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food tastes alright. I had the French toast one time, and it was kind of weird. The other time I went here I got the grilled cheese, which came out with the cheese not melted at all. It was an ok grilled cheese, but too overpriced, even for SF."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove has been my go to for breakfast in SOMA since 2010, and the food continues to satisfy. Yes, it's pricey, and it gets pretty full by 8AM. But if you get there early, you will not be disappointed. Having had lunch and dinner here as well, I can honestly say that I have always enjoyed visiting here. One word of warning: they no longer have WiFi, so bring a hotspot if you need to get any work done."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great concept, tables are not bookable you just get in line and order your food and find a seat, they bring the food to you. The queue was very long when we got there on a sataurday but the line moved very quickly and we did not have trouble finding a table. Food was outstanding!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food is ok to good depending on what you order. However inside it gets really busy and noisy on weekends so not ideal if you want to have a slow breakfast with friends/family and talk. If available try to sit outside as it is a bit more relaxed.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I loved the decor and ambience. Popular times will have a bit of a wait. We sat on the second floor with a nice tree (lol) and a view down. Ordered avocado toast, granola and greek yogurt, and chorizos platter to share. Food was yummy!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This place is a solid choice for where to work during the day if you have to. It's very open to the air so you don't feel shut in, and the trees/christmas lights decoration inside is fun. It has plugs and wifi if you need it. The cups of coffee are huge, like bowls, which is about right for my taste :). I've had salads like the goat cheese/beet one and they're big and satisfying. They have fuller entrees, ice cream, and desserts, too (all pretty big to match the coffee cups)."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food is pretty good. I think they charge more than its when though but it's OK once in a while  There is ALWAYS a line. And most likely its out the door. So if you walk by and get discouraged that there's no tables don't worry about it. By the time your get to the front to place your order a table will free up. It always works out.  Get the breakfast sandwich
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"First time here for breakfast. I ordered the beet salad and the New Yorker (Pastrami sandwich). The greens in the salad weren't well washed, so there was some bad bites. And the sandwich was just bland with no flavor and soggy bread. Not very good in general."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Best food, atmosphere, staff! Everything we tried was delicious, from breakfast to late night. The fresh squeezed orange juice was exquisite! Please give them a try. 4 San Francisco locations."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Good place for breakfast!  Fast service. Outdoor seating is available.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Good place for lunch. They also serve breakfast during lunch. Lasagna is really good an filling. I also love their mac and cheese. There could be a long wait if you don't get there before the rush hour during lunch.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is my go to spot when I am in need of some breakfast fare.  It could be mid morning, brunch time, or even late night.  They serve breakfast ALL DAY.  Not only that but it is good quality food.  The breakfast burrito is hands down amazing with the meat choices of bacon, chicken or steak. (the chicken is amazing here also) The potpie is the staple of this place very good and huge portions.  To describe the decor on the inside, think of a cabin in a mystic magical rainforest.  Its like something out of Harry Potter.  Very cool place you should check it out."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Love the ambience here... good way to brighten up your morning. The owner was very friendly and hospitable. The food was very decent and the price is fair. Will definitely come back again when I am back in town
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Enjoyed the atmosphere, lively. Many options. Got an egg white omlette with spinach, tomato, fortuna. A little heavy on the salt, otherwise fine. Carrot cake was also ok. Good sized portions. Water and milk/cream available on the side which is nice. Good for price"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Amazing service and great food! My friend ordered the chicken pot pie and I ordered The Turkey Club. We also added the spinach dip. Worth every penny.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A very nice and cosy place, you need to order at the counter, then a waiter brings the dish to ypur table. Had a great apple chicken salad, with a vegan friend who also liked his meal."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I'm not a big fan of american fare but the breakfast sandwich was great and their green sauce slapped! Latte was mid.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very nice cafe. Good fresh food. Fresh juices and tasty dishes. I was visiting San Francisco and went to The Grove twice.  Will go there again next time in SF. Highly recommended.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Gluten free choices. Family owned place. Very cozy & creative atmosphere. Indoor ""trees"" at this location. Good food & fresh squeezed juice is a nice addition."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Since they're open so late, it's a great place to go to get some work done before going out. They have wifi, but you have to buy something and they give you a code. I think it's only good for an hour. The food is not very good. It reminds me of something a college frat guy would put together to impress you even though he doesn't know a lot about food. I love their affogato though. Espresso and ice cream - what can go wrong!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very quick service.  If you see a line, don't be deterred.  It moves quickly"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"AMAZING pastrami sandwich! I mean everything was delicious, the vegetarian chili soup, the coleslaw, home fries, bread... really everything. Attentive staff, very accommodating and prompt service. Definitely a keeper!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food is very good, but service quality leaves a little to be desired. Was spending Sat and Sun in SOMA for a competition. Order on Sunday - forgot to add avocado a hirassa mayo to my order (made on-line) - Order of Saturday, forgot my drinks."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Grove is a gorgeous restraunt the interrior is amazing. The service staff were really nice and even thoiugh there was a mis hap wjth a friends order it was corrected quickly. The foo on the other hand left a little to be desired. The pastrami sandwitch was almost devoid of any flavor and a large amount of what landed on the plate was fat.  I wonder if it wasn't pastrami at all but corned beef boiled in water. Now i tasted other entrees qnd the hot dog with sour kraut was wonderful but the burrito a friend had was also fairly bland. And he just stopped eating it once he ran out of the tastey sauce It comes with.  So conclusion. Don't order the pastrami because its not. If you order the burrito ask for extra sauce but if at the very least come in and have a latte and a hot dog and enjoy the amazing interrior of this restraunt.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Stopped by for a quick dinner, and it did the trick. I tried the pear gorgonzola panini, which was great. They had a bunch of sandwiches, soup and salad, and a few other dishes. You order at the counter, and they'll bring the dishes out. The inside is roomy and quirky, very pleasant."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Super friendly greater and delicious food. Perfect stop for a quick bite while walking around the city.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, fast service but pretty annoyed that I was asked to leave after finishing my meal.  They said they needed the table.  Look I get that they are busy and want to make money, but I don't appreciate being made to feel unwelcome after paying good money to eat. I don't think I was at the restaurant a full hour."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Tasty comfort food in a casual setting. Grab a table outside or a seat by the fire, and you'll be set. Be prepared for a wait at lunch though, when seating is at a premium. You're better off visiting at dinner if you want to enjoy some quiet conversation."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Unwind and Do your Thing here and get Dinner too! It's Cozy a real (Hip & Slick Lounge area in or Outside)! Meet up with Friends all @ the Grove!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Came here for a 40 minute break I had between conference sessions. You order then take your number and sit down.  They have the system on lock, super efficient. I waited for my watermelemonade on the side or the orderinf area, which was fantastically delicious. I got the daves way eggs benny, fantastic. The hash browns could stand their own without ketchup, the bite of the bacon with the avocado and eggs with some grains was marvelous. Definitely coming back here.  Staff was super helpful every step of the way, didn't even break the bank. Thank you!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"An Excellent omelette!!  Very fluffy and very tasty. This place huge menu looks really promising, the food is fresh, the service was fast and that’ all you need to come back and try other dishes."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The breakfast burrito was great and orange juice was super fresh and sweet. Loved everything we ordered!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Had the Eggs Benedict ""Dave's Way"" which is with avocado and bacon and I couldn't even put the fork down. Great coffee and OJ as well, this place is highly recommended, breakfast is served all day too!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Pretty good breakfast - had French toasts (very good), juice (fresh and good), coffee and ""bites"" (too dry!)"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The Grove is really quick with their to-go orders, it took about 10-15 minutes to fulfill five different orders. They staff that works there is also very friendly and helpful! I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, but was kind of a disappointment. First of all, the puff pastry was not puffy, flakey, etc. While it had a nice herby flavor, the texture doesn't really qualify it being a puff pastry. As for the chicken pot pie filling, the flavor was kind of bland, as some others have mentioned. The chicken was a bit dry and the broth lacked flavor. I would not order this again. Though it was very smart of them to put the puff pastry and the filling separately when ordering to go. It saved me from a super soggy puff pastry!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Despite visiting the Grove when it was slammed at Dreamforce, they did an excellent job of serving people quickly, while maintaining excellent service and quality food. Prices are reasonable as well.  Diverse menu without being overwhelming, excellent healthy options as well"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Nice and friendly atmosphere. Food is simple and very good. Portions are reasonably sized (a rarity in this part of the world). Service is efficient and super nice. Great place for a low key dinner.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great desserts!   Carrot cake, red velvet or the chocolate cake. They used to give a big piece but last few times it was smaller. Maybe that's for the best."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A sweet spot to grab a beer and a comforting meal post-work. When I went I tried their chicken enchiladas...wasn't crazy about it. I think next time I'll go with the chicken pot pie. It's got a nice, casual feel. If you're around the area, I'd say check it out."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Why is this place so busy? The chicken enchilada was so dry and lacked a respectable amount of cheese. The 'salad' extra that came with my ribs was just a small handfull of leaves... $2.95 for around 15 leaves and a teaspoon of salad dressing.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I used to love this place, but over the past few months they've become very aggressive about policing tables. I tend to go in on weekdays during the afternoon when it isn't too busy, and haven't been able to read a book or do anything that involves interacting with a piece of technology without being interrupted 4-5 times in 15 minutes. Even meeting up with a friend to catch up incites multiple interjections and interruptions. Given that it is $15-20 no matter what you do here, this is particularly frustrating. Looking for other places in the area to enjoy for sure."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Food quality and selection were a solid 4 star for our breakfast. The wooden benches and seating are extremely uncomfortable so -1 star. Excellent friendly service!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"A very hip trendy moving with the times cafe/bistro. This establishment seems to remove that personal service, (Personal option) plus this wouldn’t be the style suitable for a relaxed meal. Great menu, swift service but quite pricey."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"At the Grove, you order at the counter, get a little stand with your order number on it, pick up your beverages, and take your seat. When your food is ready, they'll drop it off.  The line can be a bit long during peak hours.  The food is reliably good, but never great."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Got avocado toast and the goat cheese omelet. Both were fresh and tasty, and the black beans and hash browns that come with them were also great (hash browns were crispy). Ambience is really cool too, and prices are reasonable."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Seat yourself type of a place. For lunch it can get crowded, food is great though!!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Breakfast is better than lunch in my opinion.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great spot for some classic comforts. I love the chicken pot pie, and iced tea. Great spot for those looking to grab lunch downtown. The atmosphere inside reminds me of being in a large tree house with lights strung on the trees inside."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The food here is really good, but as being advertised as cheap, I felt it was far from it. While my BLT was very good, I am not too sure it is worth essentially $13. But the price point would be my only complaint as of now, as the food was quite good"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great staff and their ""Brooklyn"" chocolate cake is a chocoholic's dream come true...its super rich just to warn you...enjoy it with a hot cup of coffee. I go to this place just for the cakes. Maybe one day I shall sample the rest of the menu."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Can be pricy, but good food quality"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Popular restaurant, good selection and good food, conveniently located near Moscone Center. Order at counter and they bring the food to your table."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This location has an outdoor patio, which is very nice. The services was great and food was good. I had a Steak salad, the meat could have been better, but not bad. -1 star for food."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"For the type of place it is, food is pretty good. Got a BLT and they didn't skimp out on the bacon. They kept asking us if we wanted more drinks and kept saying no but they would still continue to ask."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My group had a tuna melt sandwich, rotisserie chicken plate and Reuben sandwich. All sandwich breads were seeped in oil, that hours later caused some stomach issues with one in our party.  Rotisserie chicken was crisply delicious outside but slightly undercooked in."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great, casual dining spot in an area that is often overwhelmed with overpriced tourist spots. Grove has a large menu mostly focused on comfort foods like mac and cheese and chicken pot pie. I've tried several items on the menu but can't help to return to their delicious mac and cheese. Grab a glass of wine or a beer and cozy up on their communal couches with some friends."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This is a good spot for lunch or happy hour. While the drinks aren't cheap, they have some nice happy hour snacks. The atmosphere is nice and they stopped providing wifi so that people will socialize and not camp out all day on their own."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Fresh salads & good quality of proteins.... better value than others in this location!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Weird waiting system. This isn’t a jail lol. Not coming again
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"One of the best restaurants in San Francisco. Staff and service are excellent, as is the food."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very nice atmosphere and really yummy food!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very nice place, excellent music, very tasty food"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"There breakfast is good, fast service. Also coffee is tasty. I"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I am sitting in the restaurant right now. Both the Eggs Benedict and the Huevos Rancheros were cold and bland. The english muffins were not toasted and the hollandaise had solidified. In addition to all of this it was overcrowded and hard to find a table. How this place has 5 stars is beyond me.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Always a good sign when there is a healthy sized queue outside on a Sunday morning. Great vibe with good food and friendly staff. Does breakfast ALL DAY!! Heated outside street seating for colder mornings.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Wonderful atmosphere and amazing food. I had the Guacamole Salad and my sister got the vegetarian lasagna and we both loved the dishes. The dressing on the salad was to die for!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The Grove delivered on a French Dip craving. Plus u can't go wrong wit some chocolate cake! Just like a fat kid once said.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Very busy.  Grab a seat whilst in line.  Very attentive staff.  Great food and amount. ""Cranberry black tea "" We witnessed a 1st date meet through leaving. GREAT IDEA."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"This Grove used to have wifi, but the staff has explained that they decided to get rid of it. They said that by removing the wifi, they intend to encourage people to stay off their laptops and mobile devices, so that people will enjoy the moment and the conversations around them.  This Grove offers a small, well curated menu of home cooked meals. They also have social hours with special drinks at discounts, which is updated regularly. Come during those hours if you can. Come whenever really, as long as you try their amazing cakes and pies. I like the quieter seating upstairs, and the outdoor seating during good weather."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"My wife and I had a great breakfast in the Grove's soothing oasis-like dining area, were served by pleasant, respectful staff, and we were completely satisfied.  The only drawback was that breakfast was a bit pricey."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Love everything about this place! Amazing veggie chilli!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Food is really good (got eggs Benedict and quiche). Stuff is friendly. A little dark inside for my taste, but they have a patio with overhead heaters."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The Grove is an excellent cafe located conveniently by the SF MoMA and Yerba Buena Arts Center. The Grove has a fun woodsie decor and food is typical american cafe with multiple sandwich and breakfast items. Food is excellent prices are moderate. Staff is very friendly. Overall a good choice if you are visiting attractions in the area.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Expensive but excellent breakfast and brunch menu. Lovely setting indoors but could use a faster service on the coffee station. Sometimes your food arrives before your coffee!
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great space with good food at prices that are reasonable for quality and location.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Consistently good food every day.  They serve breakfast all day!  My fav is avocado with poached eggs toast.  They offer a good selection and variety of food and desserts.  Casual atmosphere and California style food.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Every time I'm in San Francisco I swing by here for a breakfast burrito. It's right around the corner from the Park Central, so really convenient. There is sometimes a wait (like an out the door line) but they cycle through folks quickly!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Hostess doesnt sit you, just hands out menu. You have to order 1st (standing in line while looking at menu) they give you a number and then you sit yourself. You CANNOT sit unless you order first. Wth? It's a bit tight, theres not alot of room to move around, and forget about bringing strollers or little ones because place is small. People are either bumping into you while you eat or vice versa. When ordering coffe, you have to make it yourself on the corner table where theres creamer sugar stirrers etc. Also refill your own water in that same corner. It is a fast order and service place but not to bring a party of 4 or more. Food was 7/10."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I think tje food is better than the dish I got. Looking around at other peoples food it seemed that they has higher end ingredients than te omelet I ordered. So don't order the omlets and try the Benedict.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, great prices, and even better atmosphere!"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Some of the best eggs Benedict I have ever had. Really neat decor inside and cozy. The lady behind the counter taking orders was rude and unintelligible....no service skills.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great coffee and desserts! Decent beer selection, too. Can get very crowded and loud at times. Friendly service. Great place to relax after a day at the MOMA."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The Grove on Mission (and all of its locations) is comfort food (order at the counter) and cozy atmosphere with cute staff that is truly interested in a good experience for you. Dogs are welcome in the covered outdoor seating area where there is radiant heating.  A great place to grab a bite any time and convenient to Moscone Center and SFMOMA and the other museums in the area.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"They try to maintain the vibe of a local restaurant but they're more towards a chain/productivity focused restaurant. Food is good and service (order at counter and have it delivered to your table) is functional. If you need to get fed, good option but nothing beyond a well executed upscale version of QSR at a premium price to QSR"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I have had two breakfasts here, and they were the best ones during my vacation in San Francisco. You can choose among a menu so wide you'll have trouble making your mind up. Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Great breakfast and mimosas. Get the bottle of champagne with OJ to share instead of individual mimosas. Outdoor seating only at this time due to covid-19
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Amazing service- with a pay first, seat yourself, atmosphere, you would think they wouldn’t come and check on you. Everyone was sweet and very attentive. Food was top notch! I will definitely come back."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"The pork and beef meatballs we're delicious, generously sized and the baked polenta was a nice touch to go with it.  The cucumber ginger spritzer was not overly sweet, nice and refreshing."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Great food, just what I needed. The plastic cutlery was less desirable-my fork broke! But I think it's a pandemic thing so soon that won't be an issue"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very interesting breakfast combinations. Sizable portions and delicious food. I had the Rancheros -- highly recommended!  It can get crowded so be prepared for a wait.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,The place has a unique vibe and the portions are huge (a bit excessive if you ask me...). Breakfast burrito turned out to be a full-day meal for my small European stomach;)
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I came for breakfast and enjoyed the poached eggs and fresh orange juice. The place normally does counter service, but I had a broken arm at the time and the waitress was happy to take my order at my table."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Pleasant atmosphere, limited menu (no scrambled eggs), no wifi, burger was very greasy."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Very helpful staff and tasty food. The kitchen kindly varied our order to meet our dietary needs. Lovely environment and setting. Would recommend to others
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Recommended this place while on a trip from maryland and it did not disappoint. Ate  here 2 of 3 mornings in town. The bannana bread, fruit platter and granola are delicious will be coming for sure next time I'm in town"
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Not bad, not great. The French toast was okay. I couldn't cut through the crust, which I can't tell if that's because the knife was so dull or the crust was super hard.  Not bad though, give it a try if you're in the area as there aren't too many choices."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I really wanted to like this place, it looks nice and spacious but unfortunately they really need to work on their coffee station as I got the food before my coffee, and still did it after 20 min, I had to cancel the coffee and no coffee in the morning.... Im very disappointed. The food was ok."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,I love the place and the food.
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Quick and tasty meals, very good options for brunch, especially traditional eggs (except there are no omelettes) and breakfast burritos. Efficient staff."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"I'm at a startup where meetings are difficult to have in our itty bitty office, so I love having my afternoon coffee meetings here. The staff always remembers me, the big open up doors make you feel like you are right outside and the food is fantastic. I'm celiac and they have even offered to replace toast with their yummy potatoes- so accommodating! Highly recommend anything from their bfast menu and the berkeley bowl for lunch."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,"Fantastic place and I always go there fore breakfast when I'm in San Francisco. But Dreamforce week is just a nightmare and for some reason they've decided to have a private event and therefore close for public for two days now. I seriously just lost a LOT of respect for that place. I know it's dreamforce week, but come on..."
The Grove - Yerba Buena,690 Mission St,Friendly service & breakfast was ok. Coffee could be better. The lodge style makes it a bit prone to stuffy smells. Overall worth trying it out.
