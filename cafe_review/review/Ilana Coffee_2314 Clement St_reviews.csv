Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,We usually have breakfast at Ilana Coffee ☕️ Friendly owners and staffs. Price is affordable for us. Vietnamese sandwich combination is must try here. We also order with Vietnamese coffee. Great mix.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Lovely neighborhood cafe and sandwich shop. Stopped in this morning for a bagel with hummus and Viet coffee and am impressed with the service and fair pricing.  I want to come back soon to try their banh mi subs.  They have Wi-Fi and plugs which is nice and the seating is comfortable.  Wish I had one of these next to my apartment in Tampa. Definitely support this small business if you can in sf!
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,I randomly walked into this coffee shop during Christmas. They were one of the few coffee shops open on holiday. I had Vietnamese BBQ chicken sandwich and Vietnamese coffee. Both were excellent.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Great service👍👍 and friendly staff. Fresh hot  drinks ☕☕ great bagels 🥯🥯🥯and sandwich 🥪🌭🥪🌭selection . Sometimes it's hard to find parking 🚙🚘🚔🚖. They open @6am and there is a one hour limit to sit inside.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Ilana Coffee have Vietnamese sandwiches. This is our early morning spot for coffee and a sandwich on the weekends. We usually ride our bicycles on the Great Highway and then through Golden Gate Park. It just so happens, this is the midway point before we head back. It is a good spot because they have chairs outside and we can park our bicycles on the sidewalk without having to lock them up. Service is friendly and quick."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Bahn mí veggie egg sandwich was delicious! So were the desert pastries. A bit pricey, but very nice coffee/sandwich shop."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Nice neighborhood Vietnamese cafe. Great Vietnamese sandwiches and the bread…. Just melts in your mouth
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"I had the vegetarian sandwich with sourdough bread. The bread itself was delicious, the inside tasted pretty blend. Thanks to the mustard who give it a little kick. Other than that, the service was fast enough. They claimed to have free wifi but it didn’t work and the restrooms were out of service"
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Vietnamese hot coffee is a must-try. The flavor and aroma are so good! Bbq sandwich is crispy and yummy
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,I lived near Ilana for over three years and it was my go-to sandwich shop. The food is delicious and affordable and the owners are incredibly friendly. Definitely stop by if you're looking for delicious Vietnamese or breakfast sandwiches.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,This place has been my go-to for good bahn mi for the past few years. Their flavors and quality are always fresh. 👌
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Probably the best Bánh Mì in the city. If you’re looking for a Vietnamese sandwich and coffee in a chill café, maybe do some work or study on your laptop, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better place!"
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Great food and not pricey.. the casher and server has a great smile! Ty..
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Nice and cheap cafe. Dog friendly. No WiFi!
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Thanks for being there Ilana! Excellent breakfast sandwiches. Good prices. Great drink selection. Nice to have a place to go on a day when all else is closed - open Thanksgiving morning. Service with a smile. We'll definitely be back!
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"This place has amazing bahn mi sandwiches and Vietnamese iced coffee. I honestly loved it more than what I got at the Little Vietnam Cafe. Great ratio of meat to veggies, nice service and staff, fresh bread. AND it's all a decent price. ❤️  This place deserves some more recognition!"
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"First rate service during the week and even in weekends from the ""relief crew"" - a pleasure to visit for great coffee and excellent Vietnamese and other sandwiches. Lansy's egg salad on everything bagel is now an addiction... :)"
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Perfect! Open before sunrise. my morning was great with a nice hot coffee, thank you!! I always see people sitting and enjoying coffee outside. Nice place to go with friends."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Now this is an egg bagel sandwich! Quality. Also got the delicious Vietnamese iced coffee. Wish there was a place near me off Haight that did bagels right
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Excellent service, friendly, great prices."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Best Banh Mi this side of the city . Soild coffee, low prices, fantastic customer service. Personally I think the guy who makes sandwiches during the weekdays makes the best pork belly sandwiches"
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"The Vietnamese food is great! Plus it's cheap! Just don't expect much when you get something outside of the Vietnamese menu. Royal grounds has better coffee and is next door, BUT this place has outdoor seating."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"One of my favorite places for food, quick and delicious, owners are super kind. They haven't had the egg salad sandwich in a while but I can't fault them for that when there's dozens of other awesome sandwhich options."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Would not have guessed this cafe is owned by Vietnamese people due to the name.  It is a decent price for banh mi and Vietnamese Iced Coffee. They also serve milk tea, deli sandwiches and breakfast foods. Staff is nice and welcoming. Relatively clean with indoor and outdoor seating."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Great coffee and banh mi.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"We got here at 6am in the morning and we had to study here for a while. After an hour sitting here, they asked us to leave because they said they have one hour limit which doesn’t make sense. We purchased coffee and tea but they literally put a limit on us. I don’t know if they do this every time. Not recommend for people who come here to sit more than an hour."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Bomb banh mi sandwiches for a good price! Coffee is good, but there are better coffee-specific cafes nearby. I’d come back for the food rather than the drinks."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Simple, neighborhood cafe with a welcoming staff. Enjoy the outdoor seating (out front, facing the south which gets more sun) and the free wifi. They have some decadent looking pastries which I have been meaning to try (and I always seem to say next time to). Beverages are tasty and reasonably priced."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,This nice couple is so dedicated to serve their regulars in the neighborhood. I love their sandwiches. Very generous & tastes great.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,Really love this place for it's friendly service and delicious eats. My go to is the terriyaki chicken banh mi with the Colombian coffee :). Can't beat these prices and quality! A true Richmond gem.
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Whether you're interested in a delicious Bun mii or you want a bagel breakfast sandwich, this place is super delicious!!! Haven't been disappointed and I've been back multiple times"

Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Great hospitality and our breakfast sandwiches were delicious and fresh. The coffee was outstanding, a must go to spot."
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,"Sweet staff, and clean shop. Cheap prices and decent sandwich.. Asked for sourdough and got toastbread 😅 The coffee was not the best, and the steamed milk in the cappuccino was to foamy. …"
Ilana Coffee,2314 Clement St,I am in from PA I really like the place. I saw the server return $1.00 after serving an older couple that had been sitting for awhile when he realized his mistake. If I lived here it would be my spot!
