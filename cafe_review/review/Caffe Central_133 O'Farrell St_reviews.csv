Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"A very hip place for breakfast!  Some amazing breakfast choice for kings! Really enjoy the fresh sandwiches and waffle that they made..very European. very fresh and delicious, Highly recommend the waffle and tea that they have… you won’t me disappoint!  Amazing customer service too.  If you like this honest review, please give me a thumbs up would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you :)"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Fantastic place for breakfast, lunch, or brunch! We went here almost every morning for breakfast during our vacation. Everything we ordered was delicious, especially the L’ Amour Crepe. The crepes were sweet and the coffee was wonderful. Thank you for making our trip to San Fran a delight! ☀️"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Breakfast and coffee of my dreams. The fruit is so fresh. They make their own whipped cream. You might balk at the coffee's size but it's strong and smooth. Best breakfast I've had in a long time. Good food, good coffee, good atmosphere, reasonable prices. You might not have a place to sit during busy times, so plan ahead. We went on a weekday around 10 am."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"This is a small cafe located just off Union Square on O‘Farrell Street. It features breakfast options as well as various bakery items. Interestingly, the cafe has its lunch and sandwich options on display on the counter, Japanese style, so you easily can see which option you prefer. We only ordered coffee and fresh juices but the salads and sandwiches looked great.  The cafe is small and has limited seating immediately by the counter where you order. When the weather permits you can also sit outside on a few tables by the street.  The staff is friendly and professional.  The coffee was very good and so were the juices, and we will be coming back for more.  Ambience: 2/5 Staff: 4/5 Coffee: 4/5 Price/quality: 3/5 (pretty pricey)"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Decent place near union square for a quick cup of coffee. Coffee is better than those you’ll get from Starbucks and there’s seating outside which is a nice place to be when the weather isn’t too hot. There’s food and desserts you can get too and there’s enough seating around for everyone.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Decent breakfast before shopping in the square. The space is just way too small, especially for a Saturday crowd. A decent variety of options, and even though they were busy our food was prepared quickly."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Ordered the hummus avocado toast, and avocado egg toast. The toast could have been toasted a little more. Nice vibe. Very good coffee. Liked how organized everything was."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Good, tasty, basic breakfast, brunch, snack, food outlet. Efficient, clean, fresh, nice, tourist pit-stop, useful.  It's fine. And I'll go there again."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Amazing location, yummy food options at a fair price. But: A real downer is the food waste they’re causing just because they’re advertising their food at the bar. 👎🏾that’s a no go given the fact there’s so much hunger on earth. …"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Friendly and accomplished staff, many tasty options. I came here several times during my stay in San Francisco. One thing I had observed how messy and slightly unsanitary their food prep station is. So when I found a piece of cheese in my waffles ai wasn’t surprised."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"A must have breakfast and branch place. Everything is super healthy, a huge selection of sugar free and gluten free dishes. Great price range for San Francisco"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Nice place, friendly staff, good breakfast, but we waited a bit too long for what we ordered, they served people who ordered after us first."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Great little breakfast spot. Food is tasty and appropriately priced for the portions. I had the Barn Burner, which had very done bacon (ok by me, but not for everyone) and very runny over easy eggs (not ok by me). Runny to the point where they still had pools of uncooked white sitting around the yolk. There isn't a ton of seating in here and it can get crowded. I would go back for lunch, the display sandwiches looked good as well."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,The absolute best place to eat breakfast especially if you want a healthier option!  The absolute best!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Wish I would have gotten anything else. Tried a salad with chicken and first two bites were cartilage. It was so nasty. Super oily and salty. now I feel sick. I wish I stopped after the first bite 🤢🤢🤢
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Discovered this great cafe while visiting SF for a late lunch.  My daughters ordered the crepes with salad. The portions were tasty and filling. The pour over coffee was good, but their pastries are excellent."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"The place is so nice and cheerful, they have a big menu of different selection of food and drinks. They also have a nice outside seating area in front of Maycys. It’s in a nice shopping street. I gave them 3 stars because the coffee wasn’t as good as expected. I will definitely go back but not for coffee 😃"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"L'amour crepe (Nutella strawberry whipped cream crepe) was great, crepe was a little dried up at the edges but except for that it was great and they weren't stingy with the Nutella.  Amazing cafe at union square, perfect for meeting friends. Their menu looks great and would love to try more things from the menu in my next visit."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Excellent choice for breakfast with multiple choices either sweet or savory.  Nice coffee as well. Can get crowded during rush hours but it's worth the wait.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Prompt and great service.  Great food was served quickly and this is despite the constant long queue. Probably fastee than starbucks
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Fantastic menu! Breakfast and lunch is healthy and heaping portions. Fresh Juices & shots, coffee, matcha…I’m in heaven!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Wonderful breakfast.  Spinach and mushroom quiche, breakfast croissant, yogurt bowl with fruit, and smoothies were excellent.  Food was fresh and portions were good. The display of dishes was helpful. Will return the next time I'm in San Francisco."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"I’ve been going to the Union Square one for a long time. Food is amazing, I just didn’t understand why the skinny lady at the cashier was so mean and careless all the time. But now they have a very friendly and humble  lady that welcomes you and makes you feel like they are happy to have you there! Great food and great staff now. Super recommend it."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Fantastic place for brunch. Casual and delicious. I had the San Francisco crepe. Totally worth stopping by!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Good quick breakfast with a great variety of choices. Loved the Cuban coffee I had as well. We splurged on a dessert, the plum slice, and it was delicious."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"The ""Café Trottoir"" French experience at it's best in the heart of san Francisco!  Short Long Story, we were passing by and decided to try the below :  Smoked Chicken Pesto Sandwich & the Smoked Salmon Cucumber Open Face sandwich ! Both were incredibly delicious !  I barely order the same stuff when visiting a place many times, but will definitely do an exception for this place.  Why? ✓ The dough was soft but not sticky. ✓ the freshness of the veggies inside were remarkable. ✓ The portion size is fair. ✓ but most importantly, the blend of tastes in every bite.  Don't miss their savory sweets.  It was such a nice experience there. Definitely visiting again and again!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Had an American coffee the taste wasn’t good it taste like a coffe from a day before kind of and the coffee mug had a lot of splatters of coffee it didn’t have a good presentation . I Asked the waitress if she could make me a new one she wasn’t friendly at all then she brought another guy which gave me attitude as well and processed to bring me another coffee but it was the same thing as the first one.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Caffe Central is a good lunch place offering an array of sandwiches and salads. the portions are a good size to leave you full but not stuffed.  They have Mexican Coke and Sprite. French ham and cheese is a good go to.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Shuffled into this spot because Macy’s Starbucks was closed due to not having water?… 😳… luckily this was much better than Starbucks. Their Chai was rich and creamy and they have oat milk for those of us that don’t do cow-breast feeding. And the waffle is perfectly fluffy the way I like them. Prompt service makes it a good quick sit-down spot as well. Seems to be mostly tourists but this is one place I’d return to as a local.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Great breakfasts… during my stay in SF, I had my breakfast here almost all mornings. There are good options. They are busy, specially during weekends, and you may need to wait to find a seat."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,There are *so many* options here. Eat-in is easier than to-go since they will give you a number for your table and bring the order out as it is ready.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,At first seemed pricey but the portions are huge! Bagels and sabdwiches are delicious and they come with fruit bowl or salad on the side. Recommended.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Desserts are great. Variety of Desserts, coffee, and teas. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Can get crowded because it’s in a busy area."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Quite good selection of teas and coffee drinks, good food and breakfast options.  Would be nice if they had the ceramic cups better cleaned/washed (yes, the teas leave specific marks, but nothing that cannot be solved with proper dishwasher and dishwasher detergent IMHO) - see photo"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"good food, fast service... thank you"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Had to wait 40 minutes for a bowl of yogurt and fruit while other guests who came after us were served all kinds of food which took much longer to prepare. Bad style. The staff were arrogant and uncaring.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Saw some good reviews, thought I’d give it a try. The server/cashier wasn’t friendly at all. Asked her for a recommendation for dessert, and she gave a few suggestions half heartedly. In the end I picked tiramisu (which admittedly wasn’t what she suggested), and it’s the worst I’ve ever had. It’s so stale, it tasted like it’s been sitting there for days. I usually don’t leave food behind, but I just couldn’t bring myself to finish it. Says a lot. Ordered a cappuccino as well- it’s fine, nothing to rave about. Overall- I’m just disappointed."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Small little almost European sandwich shop with some amazing offerings, salads, sandwiches, deserts and coffee.  Perfect for a light morning or afternoon bite. 🥰"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Best breakfast in area! Especcialy bagels!!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Enjoyed the Barn Burner (2 eggs up, bacon, waffle) and fresh orange juice. Nice diner-type experience, I even sat at the counter."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Would highly recommend this place.  Lots of food and drink choices.  While we were 4 days in San Francisco, we went to breakfast every morning.  Everything is fresh, good atmosphere"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Update 4/12/2022 Today I went again and the front door is fairly clean.  ——  Pretty limited space... but because it's SF so it's reasonable. With that, they have surprisingly lots of seats, hard to imagine in such a small space.  The food is decent and generous. Sample placed next to the cashier so you can see their signature dish and menu.  A little messy and dirty esp at the front door though. People came in and out, one spilled his entire cup of coffee, the staff seems super busy and didn't come clean it up so the spill is there for a long time (at least 20min). Hope people dodge it otherwise you'll have these dirty taints all over the place.  Internet wise the cellular signal was ok. I'm using TMobile, 60 Mbps enough for work.  Overall despite of some hassle, I was still able to settle in a seat, get my work done. Considering the hassle nature in SF, I'd probably come again if I'm around and need to find a spot to work."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Disappointing. Pastries tasted old and latte was just as disappointing. We went to a lot of really great cafes in SF, this one got good reviews so we had reasonably good expectations. Choc hazelnut cake and tres leche cake were tasteless and stale. I dont know how you mess up a latte but it happened. Then at the end we asked an employee for a box and got a rudely spoken response that she doesn’t do that and to go to the register. Register had a long line and it was a very simple ask. We got our left overs to go but ended up trashing it on the way back to the hotel. Not worth the sugar and calories to keep. Unfortunate. Maybe we were the “one offs” and you will have a better experience."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"A complete waste of money. The avocado toast does not have smashed avocado, instead they just place a few slices of avacoda with no salt or seeds. The toast is not toasted."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Absolutely love the coffee here! Better than Starbucks, made fresh per order by the barista right in front of you, and the baked goods are great too. Visited here a week and have been here 3 times already, way better than other local chains and National chains alike! I recommend the central latte!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,One of the best places to get coffee and a pastry in Union Square area. Everything I had was very yummy.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Iced Cuban coffee is always so good I enjoyed the avocado toast I just think they stack it wayyy too much I took a bite out of it and all the avocado and bacon fell off as well as the greens they use to top it, disappointing bc avocado toast is expensive and I ended up spilling it all over the table :/ overall the breakfast looks yummy there id try the rest, also their French pastries are whole sale from cafe madeleine"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Food was good but far too expensive
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Best coffee i had in SF! The place is nothing fancy, but the food is fresh and good. Coffee is so much better than other downtown cafes!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Little hole-in-the-wall place with surprisingly large menu. Ordered a Cortado (off menu) which was good, and a tasty decaf mocha with little discernable added sugar. Has a lot of cold drinks and pastries as well as a a crepe and others breakfasts menu."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"I love this place. Excellent service and great deli sandwiches and salads which make it the perfect lunch drop in. Fun mix of local workers, shoppers, and tourists, just like the olden times 😉. Lots of windows, nice and airy. Love the open kitchen. My go to in Union Square."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Got a latte and crepe to go, basically uncooked. Won’t be back"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Tried the Nutella crepe and it was absolutely delicious. Really great presentation, perfect amount of Nutella filling and it was cooked perfectly. Little on the expensive side for just a single crepe but it was quite large so in my opinion it was worth it."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Good coffee, excellent breakfast (avocado toast and another type) . Service is a little confusing as not sure what is brought to the table (food) and what u should go pick up (tea). Lunch Salad (dirty bird) was ok. Charles Barkley stopped by which was nice 🙂"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Nice Food, but waited more than 30 min for the coffee - so got it way after the breakfast..."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Out of croissants but baguette was good with egg and spinach breakfast sandwich. Staff all very nice and accommodating - they made me plain toast and it was perfect!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Very unique breakfast menu of quality food choices that appeal to a wide range of tastes.  The coffee choices are good as well.  Very clean, efficient and professional staff in a clean and well kept facility."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"If I could give 0 stars, I would do it. Waiting time approx one hour, seems like they lost the order. Nothing as an excuse. Worst café in SF!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Coffee hand brewed cup by cup 😀 And real flatware and silverware (almost no plastics)! A little bit like home 🇩🇪. We enjoyed one of our best breakfast during our 3 weeks USA trip. Thank you very much!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"If I could give this place a 0, I would! Literally my worst experience at a cafe. I ordered orange juice and a L'Amour crepe: 1) my juice had an insect or fly, after notifying one of the persons there, they replaced the juice after a lot of time! I couldn't stay longer in the place so I took the ""new"" glass of orange juice to go. When I arrived home, I notice this glass has also an insect inside! And it has a lot of black dirty type of things at the bottom of the cup. Soooo disgusting! 2) the L'Amour crepe was also not good. The crepe consistency was way too hard. The harder I've ever had! Really with the juice experience is enough to not ever go back to this place. I can't imagine they preparing something clean when not even their juices are as such."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Had crepes and coffee.   Delicious cappuccino,  but the crepes were bland and too thick.  There were a lot of options though,  better than most places I have seen.   Would definitely go back to try something else."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,The food was terrible. I'm sure it's still a good place for coffee or pastries but I wouldn't recommend eating here as a meal to anybody
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Very tasty! Lots of great options.  Sampled several and all tasty. Great coffee.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Delicious waffles and coffee. Service was wonderful.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,This is my go to breakfast spot in San Francisco- I get the croque madam and a Cuban coffee every time.  Not to mention the staff is extremely friendly. Love this place- highly recommended!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Such an amazing coffee spot love the pastries and dirty chia
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Nice place for coffee abd small bite. They have a good varaity of Corazon, cakes, sandwiches and waffles. You can seat at high chairs (9) or at a two seat table (5)."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Delicious, fresh food and amazing teas and coffees! So much care is put into preparation. Highly recommend!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Great food, decent prices, and good atmosphere. The people are friendly with quick service, and the areas are clean."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Very slow. Waited over 10 minutes for my coffee drink. The woman moved very slowly while making 2 coffee drinks for the couple in line in front of me.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"This cost $12!!  2 eggs, a quarter avocado and 2 sad toast halves. Do not order the “union square” it’s a total rip off, even by San Francisco prices.  The woman behind the counter listened to my complaint and added more toast and avocado which was nice. But I’m leaving it at 2 stars because it’s management that are setting these prices and menus."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Espresso was weak and bitter. Lox bagel was very basic and bland. Quality you would expect from a hotel breakfast. Service was good, but not good enough to make it worth the money. Go next door to one65 instead, much better EVERYTHING."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Great place to have a good breakfast on the go!! Avocado bacon toast is delicious and omelette’s fresh made it!!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"All the fare (food, drinks) 1st rate. Good brunch near Powell Street."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Food quality is always great. When it gets packed it gets really loud because of the location and its surroundings. Be sure to speak up and lean in and double check that they have your name and order right. Always great customer service.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"My favorite breakfast spot in the area. Great variety of dishes, as well as bakery items. Also great for lunch."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Great food and staff, great prices too"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Very nice service. Good food and nice coffee
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Really good coffee and food is amazing!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,! Bad quality tarts taste like refrigerator and moldy . Super expensive . 7$ for  piece of tart and rude waiters. Would never go back there ever . Big disappointment
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Great coffee and cosy place to have coffee or breakfast.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,So good!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Tasty salad and pour over coffee. Also good that they have outdoor seating.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Had a flat white and a chocolate/hazelnut croissant.. Absolutely the best coffee I've had for years and the croissant was incredible
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Perfect location for shopping and parking lots in the heart of San Francisco. Love the French pastries here.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Pretty good salad, quick service, nice atmosphere."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Very good Cafe for breakfast and lunch. Coffee brewed is very good. Sandwiches and crepes are great. However, becareful with the hords of people waiting for their food. It was too crowded and we waited for 1 hour for the sandwich. We got the coffee in 10mins though. Coffee got cold until breakfast was ready and they don't refill. Overall, our nerve wracking experience was somehow over after eating the yummy sandwich."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"To quote my wife ""all you could want in this life."" Food was great, we loved it."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Nice bagel and good crepe. They also serve hot chocolate if you are fed up with coffee and tea for breakfast.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Food was tasty, good breakfast spot. They forgot a part of the order, but it was easily fixed."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Great espresso if your are looking for Italian style coffee
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Good selection of food and deserts. Lattes are very good. Has a restroom. Opposite Macy's and close to Westfields, Bart/Mooney lines and the Cable Car."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Absolutely delicious and generous amount of food for your money. Service was quick and friendly.  Will definitely be back.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"We had a light lunch, sandwiches made with a bagel and a croissant stuffed with vegetables... They were delicious! We ate them at a table on the street, great for people-watching... On the down side the lady who took our order seemed to have a personal grudge against the card reader machine, she just couldn't make it work, we eventually paid cash, and the food took an awful long to arrive. But we forgot all that when the food, at last, arrived."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Waffle with fruit was delicious! Small place with limited seating.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Seriously delightful. They have excellent pour over coffee and delicious pastry options.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"I needed to use the customer restroom but when I asked to use it, the staff said that its occupied. I waited and waited but no one came out. I then saw a staff member using a key to open the ""occupied"" restroom. They just kept it locked and didn't want me to use the restroom, even though I was a paying customer. Pathetic and prejudiced management/staff."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Looking at the review I expected much better taste of bubble tea. I had better bubble teas and this one did not met my expectations and taste.  I would recommend not to try bubble tea from this place  I'm only giving my ratings for bubble tea
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Great food/coffee at a reasonable price. Good for breakfast 👌🏻
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Al fresco streetwise, or inside, great display of available entrees, fast service....worth the extra calories."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"The espresso tastes burnt here. Very disappointed with the low quality drink. At first sip of the large mocha, I found myself needing more chocolate, sweetness, and espresso.. did they even make the drink? After the third shot, I discovered why I couldn’t pinpoint flavor as the shot tasted burnt. I am not happy with my drink.. I say Starbucks is better and coming from me.. that means something as most my reviews are coffee shops. They do offer gluten free bread so I was happy and excited to have a breakfast too. Their pastry case contains some gluten free options as well to pair something sweet with savory. I enjoyed their salmon and avocado toast with a lemon almond cake. The food here is much better than the espresso. The stars are for the food, I can’t give 3 stars because the drink is disgusting."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,I did not like the food here. I had a pancake which was very dry and tasteless. Coffee was okay. The waitress was not friendly to me.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Delicious coffee and breakfast! The fruit and veggies in our meals were so fresh!!!
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Awesome food and prompt service. Stumbled upon this place taking a walk for breakfast. Even great gluten free and healthier options.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Good quick breakfast, with good healthy options and nice coffee."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,Food was delicious. The ambience could be better as it's a small place.
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"So delicious the first time we went back again. Ordering at the counter is a wonderful idea because you can see all the amazing options in the case. We went for breakfast and tried the Nutella waffles, spinach quiche, breakfast bagel, and breakfast croissant. All were amazing! The espresso drinks were perfect. Friendly staff and ample seating inside. Will definitely go back for dessert when we are back in town."
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,So yummy! The avocado toast was delicious. There was space to sit
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Pretty good coffee, the food was excellent... The service.... Meh?!?! Seemed more like a bother than anything else. You don't need to make me feel special, I am in the service industry and fully understand people can wear you out. But you COULD make people feel welcomed. I liked the iced mocha not being too chocolaty or sweet, it allowed for the coffee to taste like it. And the chicken club sandwich was really tasty. Check 'em out!!!"
Caffe Central,133 O'Farrell St,"Below average breakfast, I ordered an Egg & Avocado and it was a disappointment."
