HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Awesome little local place. Delicious coffee, including a fun coconut one and just a nice place to sit, relax, chat and spend some time. Great location, amazing people and wonderful coffee!"
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"I love this little shop. I don’t live too far away and it’s such a cool shop. Got a coffee here while I did laundry. One of the cool things about this place is you can text ahead if you’re busy. All drip coffee, outside seating, nice people. I got the north beach which is a dark roast. If you’re looking for coffee and around I would suggest here for a drip."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"TWICE I have come here just to find the place closed when they are advertised being open.  Owner/barista responded once many hours later to inform me they were closed due to a foreseen pre-planned event.  Update your hours! It ain’t hard. I used to manage the Google admin stuff for a company.  Coffee is good, not amazing, but good and right priced for the area.. if you can find them open"
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"3 things made this my new favorite coffee stop in this peculiar metropolis:  -Neighborhood Staple: Nick knows half (maybe more) the folks walking by and his “Hey [insert name]” made it feel like the Cheers of coffee. It’s refreshing to see someone who loves their job and whose patrons love him right back.  - Banter: Helluva story teller. Telling them is difficult enough; telling them in bite sized format while you’re waiting for him to make your artisan coffee is next level difficulty. And he is a master - A griot of galão.  - Coffee: All this would be for naught if the coffee were sub-standard. But Nick would never allow such a thing. He knew his beans, could speak the lingo, and one can easily tell he’s not one of those cappuccino charlatans peddling robusta chicanery to every tourist within shouting distance.  All in, I couldn’t be happier. Being one who rarely writes reviews, this was worth it. Nick should be proud and so should the city of San Francisco."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Great ""Hole in the Wall"" coffee shop with a friendly neighborhood feel. The staff is incredibly friendly and leaves you feeling picked up even before the coffee is served. They have drip coffee but on a sunny day I can't resist a coconut cold brew while I sit outside, chat with other locals or read the paper. It's a pleasant way to start the day."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,This place *is* literally a hole in the wall and looks adorable. They have a selection of pour over coffees on offer - I tried and really liked the Redhead. The barista was super friendly. A very nice San Francisco experience.
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Great little spot for a pour over. A true hole in the wall. Although they are posted open 7-3PM make sure not to go around lunch time when the barista takes a lunch break 12:55-1:15 or you could be waiting a while for a simple cup of Joe. Limited services, seating and odd hours may steer your group to many of the other fantastic coffee bars in the area with continued service. Enjoy North Beach."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"My pour over was very weak, but the service was excellent."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Coco cold brew is life. Service is outstanding. These folks treat you like you've been neighbors for decades. Not only is it my number one favorite coffee spot in all of the bay area, it's also run by good people. Everything on the menu is stellar. Keep up the great work you guys because I can't image an sf without my HITW Coco cold brew. And the love from the people blessing us with this good stuff is so genuine. ❣️"
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"When I saw that the name of this place was Hole In The Wall Coffee, I didn't think it was literally a hole in the wall. But I guess some books can be judged by its cover, or at least its name. I was honestly hoping for a place to sit down and wait for my table at the nearby pizza restaurant, so I was a little disappointed when I saw that there was no indoor seating. But I suppose that's my fault for assuming a name like ""Hole In The Wall Coffee"" was some sort of strange euphemism.  The coffee itself was very good. The pour over was smooth and tasted like it could easily have cost $7-8. Very glad it was only $4! Even though there was no indoor seating, sitting on the chairs outside with a steaming cup of coffee actually turned out to be perfect."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,Wonderful coffee in North Beach. Espresso is rich and dark without bitterness. They also have a selection of coffee grounds.  The barista is friendly and wonderfully helpful. He squeezed in a drink for me as he was about to close. Also advised helpfully on options.  Good outdoor seating on a quieter side street for North Beach. Great location near Washington Square Park.
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"This neighborhood coffee shop has got to be the absolute best place I've ever been to, the most knowledgeable and funny and friendly barista, and by far the best bean - and coffee concoctions made by a ""coffee scientist"". So happy to have found the hole on the wall on North Beach - GO HERE to have coffee of an elevated and sophisticated nature and meet intelligent people...."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"good little spot to stop by and grab a coffee! they don’t do lids, environmentally conscious! the menu was a little intimidating for me, however the barista was very kind and walked me through it! their cold brew is made from a concentrate and can add anything to it. the barista was super friendly and kind! definitely a good little local spot to hit up and support!"
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,Ran late that day and the coffee shop owner poured me a cup of espresso. I love people in SF :))
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,great coffee!!! I loved the coco cold brew!!!
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,Least consistent coffee shop in the city. Never open.
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Hours need to be updated.  Waste of time to come here, find a trustee document saying it's been sold."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Well named, it's a small space with only outdoor seating. V. Good coffee (drip). Clearly a neighborhood space with regulars (customers, not the New England/New York coffee order).   Nice trees shading the seats. On the other hand, don't go there if you are looking for a range of pastries to choose from. But for a good cup of coffee, absolutely"
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,"Heard from proprietor ,not  closed just closed on a weekend while we were there, ill check back next visit."
HITW Coffee,524 Union St,The guy there on Fridays makes some really weak coffee. Disappointing.
