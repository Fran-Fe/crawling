Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"I recently visited Haus and was impressed by the peaceful and quiet ambiance of the place. It's the perfect environment for getting work done, with plenty of seating and a beautiful outdoor patio that's definitely worth checking out.  The black coffee at Haus is absolutely wonderful, with a rich and robust flavor that's sure to satisfy any coffee lover. I highly recommend it!  Service is also very nice and the staff is very kind.  Overall, Haus is a great place to come for a productive work or study session. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet, the coffee is excellent, and the ample seating and beautiful outdoor patio make it a great place to spend a few hours getting things done."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Coffee Haus has the perfect balanced flavored espresso. Looks and tastes good. Excellent latte art as well. Beautiful interior and back porch.
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Nice coffee shop with friendly staff. Outdoor seating in back. They need more electrical outlets.  Almond butter and jelly sandwich was decent and reasonably priced. Latte had a very nice presentation, but could have been a little hotter."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Lattes and chocolate croissants were great. Space is airy, clean, bright, and vibrant. Fruit danish was fine."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Bright and modern coffee shop right by the 24th Street BART station in the Mission. Vanilla latte was not too sweet and the baristas are friendly. Free Wi-Fi here but limited outlets so come with your devices charged. There’s also outdoor seating as well. Great place to get some work done!
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Found this place while walking around and exploring the Mission District after having lunch at El Faralito’s. This place has VERY minimal branding, just the sign outside the door and that’s it! The cups and interior are free from all the branding.  The menu is very simple and easy to understand. The only sad side of that is that there’s no syrups or creamers that you can add to your drink. I ended up going with an Iced Coffee/Cold Brew which was a nice pick me up. They have a station where you could refill your water bottle and grab a lid/cardboard straw if you wanted to take your drink to-go!  The place is very clean and quiet (there’s no background music playing).  ~~Parking: Arrived using Bart, but seems like there’s a few street parking spots outside. ~~Service: Great, service was quick. The only thing is that I kind of wished they took names because if there are multiple people that are waiting on the same drink, it’s hard to know who placed their order first. ~~Best Part: Cute vibes. I wanted to stop by because I saw there were a lot of people working/reading inside the coffee shop when passing by. After entering, the place got more cute because there’s outdoor seating in the back with umbrellas to shade you from the sun! ~~Tips: Bring something to do! I was a little sad that I was just passing by because I wanted to hang out in the spot a little more. ~~Return: Yes!"
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Beautiful place with great coffee!  Tried their cappuccino - well-balanced and robust flavor. They have ample indoor and outdoor seating. They are pet-friendly, so you can enjoy your coffee with your dog. Definitely recommend this place for a great coffee!"
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Peaceful setting with a lovely back patio and comfy leather couches as well as standard laptop tables. The cortado is delightfully balanced with a smoothness provided by the steamed milk and a light acidity from the espresso. 😋☕️  Warm and friendly staff add to the very chill vibe 🤙
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,It was a wonderful & adorable coffee shop! My matcha latte was beautifully made with love and care. The flavor was an unworldly experience and not at all bitter or watery (like haus chai). The atmosphere was so cozy and welcoming and I especially thought the outdoor seating was pretty. (don’t get the chai)
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Internet: Not fast enough. Pretty slow 🐢🌎 Charging ports: Just one, not very accessible. Noise levels: They do have some soft music playing in the background. Food/ Drinks: Amazing coffee! However, not an elaborate food menu! Restroom: clean enough"
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,I moved to SF fairly recently and have been generally disappointed with the coffee I have had so far. Haus is definitely on the list of the better cups of coffee I have had in the city.  The barista was friendly and my drink came out quickly. The space has lots of seating and there is also a nice patio area. People do seem to come here to do work on their laptops. Would definitely come back if I am in this area.
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"I don’t usually write reviews, but I felt like I should warn people not to get the Chai. My first sip was entirely froth and bitter powder and I thought “Oh, that’s not great, maybe it’ll get better when I get to the tea.” It only got worse. Getting to the liquid, it tasted incredibly bitter and watery. There was no tea or chai flavor, no creamy or milky texture, and I just found it entirely disappointing. I threw it away after a few sips because it genuinely made me sad."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,A super cute coffee place with a ton of seating and really aesthetic wood furniture! I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was inside - the drinks are more expensive in general but I liked the hot matcha latte that I got with oat milk. The wifi here isn’t super fast but they have outlets and a bathroom that’s a bit dirty but usable. Would come again!
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Peaceful, quiet, and visually inspiring café. Everyone speaks in hushed tones inside, including the barista, which makes for a truly calming environment. Lush little garden in the back if you wish to catch up with friends. Ah, and yes, great coffee and tea!"
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Beautiful place with amazing coffee on offer. The cortado was so well done and I love the bean they use. Coming back here for sure!
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"I visited this coffee shop for the first time and  ordered a regular cup of coffee. It was excellent coffee and left a pleasant lingering taste in your mouth. So much so, that I had to have a second cup.  If you enjoy your coffee like I do you'll know what I mean.  The coffee was truly amazing.  The barista was very kind and polite, he even gave me a small demo of some of their coffee.   Pricing is reasonable and about what you'd expect to pay in these gourmet coffee shops."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Such a sweet coffee shop. Chill ambiance and vibe. Suitable for reading or working. Coffee is always top-notch!
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Good space to bring your computer - but make sure it’s charged. Sunny, lots of seating, cool outdoor space."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Such a great place to study or read! There's a good amount of seating, comfy couches, a fireplace on the back wall, and reliable wifi. Coffee was great as well! Such a hidden gem as far as the SF Cafe scene goes."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Quick, friendly service and a very vibey place. The back patio was great, and the inside was the perfect work/study atmosphere."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"The café itself is gorgeous (tons of natural lighting and seating!) and ideal for an afternoon with a book, some work, a journal, etc. However the service is REALLY slow, WiFi is not that fast, and they play some pretty weird music.... it’s also really loud on the street outside"
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Super cool place with ample space! The pastries are delish and there is a patio in the back as well!
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Super chill place for laptop work. Decent Wi-Fi. ambient music. Low key barista. Good coffee. Has a patio in the back.
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"One of the best place to work, they have good wifi connection, plugs and good coffee. What do you need more?  The atmosphere is nice, not to noisy, people are gathering there to work which give you this ""willing-t-work"" mood that I'm searching for.  The crew is amazing, after the third day I came he remember of my order, it gave me an amazing feeling of caring.  I highly recommending this place. They even have a lovely terrace in the background. Only sad thing, they close early.  Enjoy your stay there!"
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Ambiance is good, but silent and mostly people working on their laptops. Back patio is nice and sheltered, even on winter days. Coffee is underwhelming, not up to the price."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"extremely chill coffee shop in the mission district. it was very beautiful and had comfortable seating, great selections, warm design, calming music."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"One of my favourite cafes in the city. It's extremely peaceful, with lots of seating, free wifi (including weekends) and the wooden interior is really nice. There's a small assortment of baked goods, and $3 toast with spreads."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,Coffee bar located on 24th Street in LA Mission. Offering Ritual Coffee and other favorites is among sobe of favorite coffees. The crew that works here is great as well add that outdoor patio. Basically you should go here for your local awesome coffee.
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Huge bummer. Milk was too hot in latte/ cap and then espresso didn’t taste good. The toast was disappointing as well. But good vibes, minus all the laptops."
Haus Coffee,3086 24th St,"Great place to study. Probably my favorite in this part of the mission. When I have some friends I want to catch up with, I definitely come to their back patio"
