Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"A nice surprise find. The ham breakfast burrito reminded me of the one's I make at home. It was delicious and filling. My son loved his Eggs, ham and cheese bagel sandwich. The Vanilla Latte was just as I love. Very happy with my late breakfast."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"The cutest little hole in the wall cafe. Service was fast and friendly, pricing was extremely great for value and the food was so good."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"I’d give a 4.5 cause of price. But honestly 20 dollars for a meal, coffee, and brownie isn’t horrible. Otherwise they have just about every food you could think of and it’s made fairly quick. Really good burritos, great brownies, and decent coffee. For sure worth checking out"
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Great sandwiches. I got the chicken salad on a croissant and my family got the veggie bagel and a ham egg and cheese on a croissant. All were great. Atmosphere, drink selection, and restrooms are all nice. Public water pitcher is a plus also."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,This place is okay. It's affordable in comparison to the other places in the area and that's appreciated.  The breakfast sandwiches can be skipped but the lunch sandwiches are delicious and worth a try.
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Delicious food, fast service, nice employees. I added avocado and sprouts as an extra."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"A small, friendly cafe in the Polk Gulch area offering a great variety of bagel sandwiches, club sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and more. Price was good, food was great. If you are exploring the area or need a quick worthwhile lunch stop. This is definitely a place to buy a sandwich."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Super low key spot. I got a pastrami sandwich on the sourdough roll and it’s one of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had. New favorite sandwich spot. I wish I could make it here every day.
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,The bagels were BOMB . Coffee not so much but its worth trying out.
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Great breakfast to pickup and go, with the sausage burrito being my go to followed up with their ham&cheese breakfast sandwich on English muffin. I wish they were open earlier because I'd go more often"
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Had a great breakfast sandwich (croissant). The breakfast burrito and smoothie were also really good. The place is clean and comfortable and staff were friendly and kind!
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Cute little shop in a cool area, bagel was very good but I hated that they did the spinning tablet tip thing."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"This place was delicious, came here with friends on a trip where we specifically wanted to try different restaurants and we still wound up coming back here for a second round. I had a lox bagel the first time and a breakfast burrito the second time. Both were delicious and the burrito was wrapped in a way that you'd get a taste of everything in each bite. This would hands down be the breakfast and coffee recommendation of the trip."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Would be 5 but they didn't appear to have a restroom
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Bunch of options in the menu. Great sandwiches, Great prices I really enjoyed my breakfast ."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Unreal egg and cheese on a bagel. Dense, flavorful, but soft asiago bagel. Egg, cheese, and turkey cooked to perfection."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Very nice cafe with good coffe. It is very personal. I brought my own gluten-free bread and the waitress made some nice sandwiches for me. The eggs and bacon was good as well.
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Excellent food, service, and general calm vibe in cafe. I highly recommend!"
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Love their sandwiches. They are also super nice to customers.
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"If you’re too hustled and bustled out by the glitz and bland of downtown San Fransisco, head on over to this quaint little shop and enjoy a delicious breakfast burrito. While pricey, the place was quiet and the food tasted great."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Wanted to be a regular here because I loved the food but the attitude of the cashier just put such bad taste in my mouth. I watched everyone who ordered after me getting their drinks and food and when asking if at least my simple coffee order was ready after waiting for 20 mins she sassily answered “I will make it for you” without even looking back at me. So unnecessary to have an attitude Saturday morning. Drink some coffee
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Lots of old world funky charm at this sandwich shop. Really nice staff puts a lot of attention into each sandwich... In our case, two fat breakfast burritos with turkey sausage and cheddar. Pretty good coffee."
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Bagels and sandwiches are great! Egg and cheese with hashbrowns are my favorite. Their chai tea latte is very good.
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Try the turkey avocado on Dutch crunch ... it's delicious!

Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,Workers were nice. Nothing to recommend food-wise especially with so many better options a stones throw away on Polk. Same with the coffee. TVs make the place feel lowbrow even though they have nice interior decoration (maybe only left over from when it was Lealand Tea).

Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"A chill place to get a very good sandwich. Most sandwich shops tend to be forgettable and serve the purpose of filling your tummy without delighting your taste buds much. Sammy's however, attends to both the stomach and the palate. 👌 …"

Secure WiFi, easily accessible for those who physically need it and very comfy seating with a bit of window view if you fancy. My only complaint, very warm inside and a little pricy, but otherwise recommended 😸"
Sammy's Cafe,1416 Bush St,"Waitress did not listen to orders and she didn't know the menu when asked what bread there was she couldn't remember and said look at the board but didn't tell us where to look,the foods not that good otherwise the speed was excitable"
