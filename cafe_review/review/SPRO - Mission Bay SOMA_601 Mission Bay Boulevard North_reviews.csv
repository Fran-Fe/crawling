SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"+1 for environmental friendliness with provision of compostable utensils/containers +1 for quick prep +1 friendly staff  However, the presentation was lacking. I was definitely expecting something more exciting out of the smoke & mirrors drink, which ended up being just that - smoke and mirrors. Edible gold dust? Didn’t see it in the drink. The sandwich looked pretty vanilla. The taste was also lacking. The pulled pork sandwich tasted more like a school cafeteria sloppy joe (you may be into that but I wasn’t). The coffee had an interesting floral flavor but I’m not sure it would really be anyone’s “go to” drink. But that’s just me.  Would have given 4/5 but the price points at $7 for a drink and $11 for pulled pork sandwich leaves a slight bitter taste in my palate and leaves me feeling that I didn’t get the best foodie ROI. Also, not sure I get a lot of experimental “lab” out of the textures/tastes/presentation."
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"I’ve had good espresso drinks from here years ago but their quality has decreased since then. Today, my espresso was under-extracted and the milk was wayyy too hot. I would probably go to Blue Bottle across the street for their consistency in great espresso drinks."
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,July 2022: Tried the roast beef sandwich and a veggie sandwich. Both were really good. I thought the veggie sandwich was really unique and delicious!  The bread 🍞 is really good for sandwiches. Nice and light.  People come here for the coffee drinks but I think people should come back for the sandwiches 🥪!
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,I loved the vibe and this place has exceptional coffee and food. Must visit!!
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"I found this place on Yelp looking for a coffee shop walkable from chase center and I’m glad I did!!  I got the mardi gras cold brew-bomb! My friend got the Island Hop- ube/coconut flavors(which I tried). If you do not like those flavors , don’t get that drink because flavors are strong. But they have a good selection of coffee/teas on their menu. I absolutely recommend this place!"
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"I love SPRO so much! I come here every time I go to SF (one day Spark Social was closed for a private event, and I was heartbroken). Baristas here treat all guests like friends and everything on their food and coffee menus (and also on a secret menu) is nothing less than amazing and wonderful! If you don't know what coffee to get, try Coco de Mer or Orange Blossom"
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"Rich and his team are amazing. The moment I sipped the Coco de Mer, it was love. Dark chocolate, coconut, and coffee?! Come on. I hate overly syrupy drinks and am a habitual black coffee drinker but this was definitely worth the foray. Order food here, it ensure you're back the next day for more."
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"Beautiful presentation as well as tastes good (especially coming from a food truck)! Located in Spark Social, Spro has a delicious brunch/breakfast/small bites menu :) I had the Southern Bell (red velvet waffles), the Umami Bomb (avocado toast), and the Farmer's Market!  Would definitely recommend the Umami Bomb!!"
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"Honey is not vegan. Please update your menu to correctly label items.  If you offer a vegan alternative, it should be listed as “vegan option available” instead of straight up labelled as vegan."
SPRO - Mission Bay SOMA,601 Mission Bay Boulevard North,"The establishment has a very limited / nearly no selection of vegan items and, unfortunately charges extra for vegan milk (but not less if you want to make the single dish available — umami bomb —, vegan).  It does call out vegan items on the menu, which is appreciated."
