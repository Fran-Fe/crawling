Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,Really good coffee and bagels with vegan options! Super friendly staff :) and nice deck outside with seating
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,"Alton, Heem, and Mario were amazingly friendly and chill owner, worker, and social media manager, respectively. They are keen on re-introducing Tallio's in the neighborhood after a rough period during the height of the pandemic. With this great team, Tallio's is truly coming back strong as a foundational neighborhood coffee and breakfast eats staple in the local community.  The shop itself is small but has a lovely, fully-shaded outdoor parklet. They offer free wifi for you to chill and do some work in, the ambiance is nice with lowkey R&B and hiphop music playing in the background. Generally quaint, I enjoyed sitting here reading with my dog in tow.  I ordered the Turkey Panini and Iced Chagaccino Latte (yes, they do have Chagaccino here!!). The panini cane warm but not fatally hot, and it was slightly spicy and the cheese melt pulls into stringy goodness with every bite! It was like eating a less heavy pizza with sourdough bread and turkey, absolutely amazing. The Iced Chagaccino was amazing, just strong enough for that caffeine kick I needed, but also refreshing. I also like that they offered alternative milks.  I also love that they support and sell crafts like ceramics and mugs by local artists in the Bay View neighborhood. I bought a beautiful jade green coffee mug by Shoshana Roodman while waiting for my freshly made ""brunch"" goodies.  I will definitely be coming back, especially since it’s a straight shot down the street or a short T Muni ride over! Thanks for having me, providing an introduction to your goods, and telling me about your small local business!"
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,Tallios is a phenomenal shop with great espresso and an incredible staff. They introduced us to the Bay View community and got us excited about what's to come. I'm excited to see if they can find more local bakeries to source pastries!

They have outdoor seating which is very nice and indoor seating as well.

Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,"Drove out of the way to check this place out only to find they're shut down until ""late August"". One star because owner needs to update your online presence and update hours on Google. If you care about your customers, you should probably let them know know they don't waste time trying to visit. Will happily come back and edit this review once they're back opened."
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,"Really great shop and owners! I stopped in on a Saturday morning, when other restaurants and cafes are normally closed in the neighborhood. They have an outdoor seating area. I ordered an iced caramel latte, which was delicious, and I would definitely come again!"

Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,We have enjoyed Tallio's Coffee for over a year now and continue to enjoy the quality and taste of Tallio's beans. I highly recommend their coffee from a local small business owner who could use the business.
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,"Great way to wake up on Independence Day for my last day in the bay! The staff was friendly and welcoming, the coffee delicious, and they had free WiFi. The owner is really cool and told me his goal is to open upscale coffee shops in lower income neighborhoods around the bay. Very cool spot to grab a cuppa!"
Tallio's Coffee & Tea,4732 3rd St,"The coffee is very good, the place is warm and beautifully decorated. The service leaves a lot to be desired. Almost if you disturb them, not at all friendly, which is the opposite of what I expected in a small neighborhood cafe. If you are the owner and you read this review and want to know more about my experience please contact me via email. I will gladly answer you back."
