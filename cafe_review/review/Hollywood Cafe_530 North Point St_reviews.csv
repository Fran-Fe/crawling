Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Cool little place. Still have outside seating. It looks like it's all covered leftover from covid but it doubles the size of the restaurant which is good for them. I had the BLT which was good. My daughter had the French toast which he enjoyed.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Good food, Burger was very good, I would add more salt and some spices, but this is me. My wife’s chicken wrap was really good, my son’s grilled cheese also. I like that they adding fruits to every food. People working there are very nice and kind.  Update 2/23/23: Went for 2nd time and I was not disappointed, food in this restaurant is really good. If you are near by, go there and have a breakfast!! You will not regret it!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"I came on a weekday around 11AM. It wasn't too crowded with a couple of customers. I sat outside and ordered ""Audrey Hepburn"" for 20.99$. The service was excellent! Super friendly and made me feel very welcome. They got me in a good mood and made me feel very cared for. The food was delicious, very good fruit and the pancakes were fluffy. I did not get a chance to go again, but I would when I visit San Francisco again. I would definitely recommend giving this Café a try and hope, your experience will be as good as mine. I can't say anything about the inside because I didn't go in."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"They charge 18% mandatory “gratuity” on your bill no matter the party size; even for 2 people. Other than that the ambience is very nice, food is good (7/10) and servers are friendly.  I would suggest the owner that the customer will be happy to provide a 18% for a good service but it feels a bit odd when you slap it on us."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We stayed at a hotel nearby and felt like a traditional breakfast place. When we found this place, we weren’t disappointed. We had a traditional eggs, bacon, hash brown, and toast breakfast with a couple breakfast cocktails. Nothing bad to say at all! Food was great, cocktails were delicious, and our son loved the crispy bacon. The service was also excellent and we left with a long lineup by the door (which speaks for itself) Thanks for the great meal!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"This place is Divine!  We came here absolutely starving after a red eye flight. They sat our party of nine rapidly on mother's day.  The food was beyond expectations. I got the breakfast wrap and it was made with the freshest and healthiest of ingredients, and it actually tasted amazing! The oranges were to die for. We were all very satisfied.  It was a little hard sitting outside by some loud traffic, but worth the food.  Would come here again."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"so-so. quick and easy location for folks staying near the waterfront. the food is OK, but left a little something to be desired. like most things in the area, it’s meant to cater to tourists.  i got the breakfast burrito. potatoes, scrambled eggs, and some ham rolled up in a tortilla. can’t go wrong."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,The food was very average.  But the price is very high. For three people I paid more than 80$. You pay half the price when you order a Lift Taxi to Chinatown and eat dim sum or anything there.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Straight forward breakfast food here. Tastes good and presented well. The atmosphere, food and service were all good, albeit pricey."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"The cafe was a great choice for breakfast as it was right next to our hotel. The breakfast options were plenty, the service was real quick and the staff was friendly."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Loved the breakfast here. I had the Denver omelet with a side of fruit. Omg ! The fruit is amazing. They don’t give you a small amount. It was a good portion and so fresh. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice which was so good. My bff got the Marylyn Monroe breakfast which is fruit and French toast and she also got a latte. She said it was good. They’re extremely busy so we had to walk up to the counter and get our check. They did end up messing up on the check and I paid someone else’s check which if it wasn’t for my bff I would have paid $114 on our food which I’m like what the heck did we eat. Lol They did apologize and found the right bill. Overall experience 10 out of 10. I was curious to know how there lunch is.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Totally recommended. Nice place, good vibe and for a busy place, good service. I had the chilaquiles and they were completely different from what I’m used to but they were very good I must say. I also had one of their pancakes which was also very good. I got there early and the place was already packed and there was a short line. Anyways it was just me and got placed in a very short time. By the time I left there was a longer line but based on my experience is totally worth it and they don’t take that long. Coffee was okay though. Also this restaurant is close to many things so I consider it a good option to start your day."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great food , service and atmosphere. I ordered Ube latte, Marilyn Monroe, which is one of the cafe's favorite, and my husband ordered meat lover omelette. Highly recommend this place."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We waited only 15 minutes. As we were 6 we had to split into 2 tables otherwise it would have taken more time as they only have one big table inside. The food was great! We ordered omelets, sandwiches, and pancakes. The coffee was great too and they served super fast."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Nice place for breakfast. There was no wait to get seated and the food was pretty good.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"The food and service were exceptional. They have a lot of patrons but you would never know it by the quick service. People are attended to very well and timely, almost like an eat and go. It is a little crowded but they handled it very well by setting up a makeshift awning over the sidewalk."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Fantastic breakfast, this shrimp salmon benedict was every bit as good as it looks! Thank you for a great meal."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Great portions! Order the fruit as a side. Ripe deliciousness. EGGS BENEDICT TO PERFECTION. No frills place but if you want good food and service. This is the best in Fisherman's Wharf area.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,We ate our breakfast : pancakes and sandwiches and it was very good !😉 I recommended this place !
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"A very nice place to take your breakfast or lunch, people are queing up here! I really enjoyed the eggs, fast and good service, warm heaters outside, so a nice place I should have been earlier during my stay!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,This is a wonderful breakfast place! The service was so fast and the food was delicious! There were plenty of options and the addition of fruit to each plate including my side pancake was so refreshing! We left feeling satisfied but not weigh down/overstuffed. Highly recommend!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Excellent food and lots of seating choices, especially outside. Our waiter was fast, efficient and accurate (usually you can get 2 of these). Fresh squeezed orange juice and good coffee. Their fruit garnishes were extra delicious vs the tasteless perfunctory fruit you typically get at restaurants."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We were seated right away but may have had good timing because the line to enter was growing when we left. The food was great, a lot of options and some unique dishes I hadn't seen before. The theme is cool but the restaurant itself is small, so early bird gets the worm here. Enjoyed it overall and will go back."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"This is our go-to spot when in town to site see.  They always have a great fruit selection, and French toast and Pancakes are good.  Eggs Benedict is good.  Staff is super friendly and very attentive."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"It was really delicious breakfast . Big portion, a lots of fruit in the plate. Friendly server. They have vegetarian option which is really tasty. But smelled a little bad inside."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"The staff are extremely friendly and kind. The food quality and quantity are both excellent! I'm from Illinois, so of course the prices were shocking, but after eating at several places in San Francisco, I quickly realized that the Hollywood Cafe prices are in line with or competitive with other restaurants in its class. My family was traveling with extended family from the Netherlands. The waiter was so kind to convert a menu item to accommodate our Dutch family. They made an American version of an ""uitsmijter"", which is a sandwich made with a piece of ham and a sunny-side-up egg on toast. My group was so impressed with their food quality and attention to detail, that we went for brunch again the following day. We didn't even have to talk to anyone... they RECOGNIZED our group, and started setting up a table for 9. Wow!!! The food on the second day was every bit as yummy as the first day!! Special compliments to the fresh squeezed orange juice and the hot cocoa... Yum! Thank you so much to the welcoming wait staff!!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Very friendly staff and great food. Located right near the trolley line.  The sandwiches and wraps were very good, as was the French toast.  Salad was fresh with fruit! A little pricy but worth it."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Fantastic food, came for brunch/lunch, got breakfast food. Really good quality of food, service is quick. Nice atmosphere, clean, plenty of seating. Paid between 20-25 dollars per person"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"I found the food to be very good and delicious. Unlike other breakfast restaurants, they have a wide variety of options that you can choose from. Fruits and vegetables are included in every meal as well. The place is clean with healthy foods. There is a lot of patience and kindness shown by the waiters. It is highly recommended that you try it out. I imagine urban living to be like having a nice breakfast, chatting with friends, and sitting by the not so busy north point road on a Saturday morning."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Fruit bowls wow!!! And delicious food in general. Wish i knew about this place the first day we had breakfast would’ve came here everyday instead! Portions are very generous, got the chilaquiles not the Spanish actual type at all but they still tasted very good. Hashbrowns are nice and brown crunchy yummy, and again fruit bowls wow!! A great mixture and very fresh fruit! Space indoors is roomy and there is outdoor seating as well. Heat lamps are used inside and outside if needed and service is very kind and pretty quick for the amount of customers! Will definitely come back again. Oh and decor is very cool! Lots of pictures all over the walls very nice."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Good breakfast but service felt too oppressive: you can't have a few minutes to make your choice, waiters kept coming asking every minute if we were ready. The atmosphere is nice, but it expensive: probably in line with SF prices, out of range for European standards."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Food was good and so was the service.  There are lots of options but not allot for people with limited diet. They were busy but the service was still quick and efficient.  We sat outside and the atmosphere was good enough. We would go back but not necessarily seek it out.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Absolutely phenomenal! I really loved the breakfast here, and how they all pretty much come with fresh fruit. The best part is the fruit is not just melons, it's loaded with grapes, all kinds of berries and some banana slices. The food was all perfectly cooked too. They have a mimosa flight which is fun for a girls brunch. Also the Hollywood hash browns are amazing. There topped with bacon, mushrooms and cheese. The staff was very friendly and the food was quick too. Even if there's a line this place is definitely worth waiting for."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"The food is adequate but basic. The coffee is delicious and the servers are great. It was like going to a Denny's but with a smaller, local vibe.  My six year old said the bananas were excellent and he especially enjoyed the syrup and butter."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"So freaking delicious! I am writing this as I just finished the meal!!! I had the dulce French toast - with fried banana and candied walnuts, and a side of hash-brown. Freak of nation, so delicious and so filling !!! Saved as a favorite…"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Stopped for breakfast for 3 people. Pretty expensive we thought but normal I guess for San Fran.  Receipt total 68.00+  Don’t know what the open food charge was all about. Thinking maybe because we had a water. Closed water just carrying it with us. We don’t recall drinking anything we brought in.  Steak was more like a hamburger. Hash browns cold and meh.  We had a latte spill and the waiter was very quick to respond and very attentive.  Served it’s purpose. Close to hotel.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great pancakes and french toast for some solid comfort food.  The coffee was strong, waiters were attentive and service was slick.  Nice atmosphere, good food, good value (for SF)."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Vegetable omelette was pretty tasty.  Stuff with veggies.  Loved the hash browns seriously.  Yummm.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and delicious for sure.  I loved all the colors on my plate.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Combo breakfast was fantastic. Kid meals were great too.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Some of the best breakfast I’ve had! It was a short walk from my hotel which was convenient. I ordered a simple breakfast and a vanilla cappuccino. Kept it simple but this breakfast packed a mouthful of savory taste!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Huge portions and delicious food! Kids had chocolate chip pancakes. We had eggs Benedict. Get there early and it’s worth it. Friendly staff! Yummy grapefruit mimosa!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Wanted in a long line, but it went pretty fast. Food was really good if you can tell but the empty plates. The burrito was scrumptious!  And my hasbrowns were anything but boring. I appreciate that it has flavor without being overdone. The beverages are freshly made which is a super plus. DONT LET THE LONG LINE SCARE YOU."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,We googled best breakfast near us and this was the most recommended.  We were not disappointed.  The menu was exciting and diverse.  The portions were extremely generous.  The service was prompt and friendly.  It was nice to sit on the side walk in the fresh air and enjoy a delicious breakfast to begin our day.  The prices reflect their pride in their food and service though we would definitely eat breakfast here again!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We got there on a Sunday around 11. We had to wait in line 20+ minutes but it was worth the wait.  The service was quick and the food was great.  We ordered blueberry pancakes, buttermilk pancakes and a three egg ham and cheese omelette."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Amazing brunch spot for delicious yummy breakfast. Friendly staff. There’s usually a line up on weekends. Very well located. The restaurant itself is small, outdated and has sketchy washrooms but who cares when they have tasty meals!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Their pancakes are amazing. As pretty too look at as to eat. The bacon was yummy, yes I know all bacon is yummy, but theirs especially. The Eggs Benny in the other hand was just good. I found it to be a bit bland. I still devoured it, but I had higher hopes! Good dinner style coffee too."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We got the hash burrito and the 2 egg breakfast with bacon with the upgraded hash browns (Hollywood style). The hash browns are absolutely to die for! Everything else was amazing, so don't get me wrong, but we were fighting over the hash browns. :)"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Very nice. Come early. Even in the early morning there’s waiting.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Very good breakfast here. Good portions and quick service. This was definitely a good choice.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We had nothing to complain about, the food was perfect!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"The place came highly recommended as a breakfast place. I must say, this is not the most elegant place I have ever been to- as matter a fact, disappointingly simple- the food makes up for it. Large and tasty portions, and while you do have to wait a little bit, everything seems to be fluid once you order. The Staff is interesting. They are not overly attentive, as they are on some places, bit they are always there if you need them and also helpful and friendly when engaging ina brief conversation. There is a satisfying secrecy in knowing that all those people who are passing by have no idea how delicious the food is, because of how the place looks. The restroom is also a shared public one.  Not ideal for a date 😄  however of you want good food I definitely and highy recommend it 👌"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"I have dietary restrictions. The staff took my order accurately, and my food came out just the way way I asked for it. The Hollywood Hashbrowns are really good. The fresh fruit bowl here is much nicer than the one served across the street."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Cool brunch spot, french toast was good"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great diner food selection! The eggs Benedict were on point, just as the sauce! The little fruit pieces were nice as a mini desert :) Waiters were ninjas that kept my coffee cup filled at all times :’)"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great option for a late breakfast/ brunch. Pancakes, omelettes and wraps are all delicious. Veggie omelette is filled with onions, mushrooms, arugula and peppers - very tasty. Regular pancakes comes with fruits, the Audrey Hepburn combo is essentially the same (much more fruits) but $5 more so if you don’t want a large fruit bowl, regular pancakes are as good. Hash browns are a different take - thinner and crispier - but delicious nevertheless. For something unique try the Hollywood Hash! Definitely worth a visit."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Very good place for breakfast! Service was fast and professional in a clean comfortable atmosphere! We had eggs Benedict and pancakes and sat on the patio and it was a great experience!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"There's a reason this place is so popular! Friendly, quick service turns around the line and keeps tables moving. Fruit bowl is a specialty and not just berries and bananas! There was watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, grapefruit... You get the picture. Hearty, meaty meal options for the carnivore and healthy, fresh options for others. We had the Rancheros with fresh guacamole and the Marilyn Monroe French toast with fruit. Both delicious!  We ate here and around the corner at Eight AM and preferred Hollywood Cafe for the better menu, but both were amazing and recommend you go to both like we did. Don't let the line deter you as, again, it moves quickly and you can read the menu in line so you know what you want when you get seated. There are so many choices! I wish we had tried the sweet bacon. Next time..."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Trying new places is always scary, especially when you have preferences or stick to your usual. But this place has had by far the BEST eggs Benedict EVER! The English muffin wasn't soggy and I finished everything on my plate. Thank you Hollywood cafe for your delicious food and tasty lemonade! Will be back for another bite!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Excellent and efficient service. The eggs Benedict were delicious. Even with a line we were seated quickly. The outdoor tables are sheltered so it was enjoyable to dine outdoors.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"There was a line up to get in but we didn’t wait too long as we requested to sit outside. The host wanted to make all 5 of us to sit around one table. We argued and he eventually let us take 2 tables. The portions are huge. Share if you’re not too hungry. Burritos are great. Again, they’re huge!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"super tasty breakfast with excellent service, your coffee is always topped up! needless to say we ate here a few times. it's not the cheapest but were are on holiday!  closes after lunch!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great portions for the price, and friendly staff. I'm not sure if the eggs I've been eating all my life are sub par, or if they put magic in their eggs, but the best tasting scrambled eggs I've ever eaten."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Exceeded my expectations! A good lesson for me in ""not judging a book by its cover"". At first glance the outside dining ambiance was unimpressive and the menu was limited and pricey, but once the plates came, wow! The serving sizes were generous, the plating was so pretty, and everything tasted amazing. I had the avocado toast w/scrambled eggs (soo pretty). I can't wait to try the shrimp eggs benedict tomorrow and maybe even a mimosa with the fresh squeezed OJ everyone raves about. 😊"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Food is good. Fresh orange Juice. I'm not used with the way things go in america  but a tip was claim and ""gratuity 18%"" of the bill was already included in the price."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,One of the Best Mushroom/bacon burgers I have ever had. Large portions great food. Not fancy on the outside but don't judge it from that.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Service was great when we went on a weekday. The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was great. Spoilt for choice for the brunch variety. Definitely will come back here to try out the lunch and dinner. Absolutely love their Hollywood hashbrown
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Love their hash brown, perfectly golden and crisp outside and soft inside. The crab eggs Benedict and French toasts taste good too. Service is okay and the staff is friendly.  The missing star is the restroom. It’s not in the restaurant but you have to walk out the resto and find another entrance (and don’t forget to ask the waiter for the access code). It’s not really the problem. The problem is that the restroom is pretty messy or I’d give 5 stars."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,This place is overrated. Did not live up to the hype. You will be very disappointed if you come here. The quality of the food was subpar. Pancakes were not fluffy and the omelette was bland. Please find somewhere else to go.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Thick chewy tasty pancakes, loved it!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"good food, very fast to serve. fries are real, fresh. service isn't fast, you have to call for them for anything including bill."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,We got the Hawaii burger and the berry salad with grilled chicken. They serve both breakfast and lunch and they close at 2pm. Get there in the morning early to avoid the long lines. We both ordered grapefruit juice and it was perfect not being too sweet or sour. This place is across the street from our hotel the Hyatt at fisherman's wharf.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"After six plus years, we accidentally ended up here for breakfast. This is a fantastic little street side cafe with an extensive yet simple menu."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,I don't know what to say but since we came here restaurant are fast with cooking food I haven't wait a long time to get my food since I eat around San Francisco. This place is amazing with breakfast stop by check out this restaurant. I'm from Seattle WA and San Francisco is doing a great job with fast cooking amazing 😍. Good breakfast people work here are amazing doing a great job serving!!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Came in early and the place is already filling up at 730am! Ordered their crab omelette, and based on the portion I got salad instead of the regular hash brown. Such a good choice! The portion was outstanding and I really enjoyed my omelette. The crab meat, though not super fresh, was fresh enough for me as to not having that annoying strong seafood taste which usually stemmed up when the seafood was set long. The avocado goes well with it, and the whole thing was lightly salted. The overall taste was very balanced and the ingredients great. My friend ordered eggs and bacon sandwich and he enjoyed it. The only complaints was that they gave too much fruits haha! The side toast was ok, goes well with the omelette. Service was good and fast. The staff was friendly. A very good experience overall."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"the food isn’t extraordinary by any means and the service wasn’t the best. don’t get the orange juice. the french toast was pretty decent. overall, it’s a decent place to get breakfast if you’re sightseeing and don’t care to get a fancy breakfast or stop at a fast food place."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Had the eggs beni. Mine was ok but the hashbrowns were funky. My wife's had a big hair on her eggs which were returned and refunded. They were busy and the service was soso hence I would have to think twice in giving another try with so many breakfast options in the area.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,I freaking amazing here and the service is one of the best. I strongly recommend trying them out whenever you have a chance. The food is that amazing here and their prices are pretty great too.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We walked right in and got a seat but lines do form outside. It’s a cozy place but you do have elbow room. The food is okay - the omelet is made weird, meet on bottom and egg set on top. My beacon egg and cheese was gooood!  They did have issues making eggs. I’d come back, but they’re expensive!!!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"We went here for breakfast, as it came highly recommended, and were pleasantly surprised by a short wait for a table. The quality of food here is exceptional. You can't go wrong with any of the eggs Benedict -- I personally tried the classic, turkey, and salmon while visiting San Francisco on a weekend trip. The banana chocolate Pancakes, and doche French toast are also very sweet, a.k.a. the dessert of breakfast. You can go for a flight of mimosas if you feel like it, or a refillable coffee. This breakfast spot is conveniently located next to fisherman's wharf, where there is plenty to do, so it's a great place to start your day if you're exploring SF. Otherwise, it's just an awesome place for breakfast food. Finally, the staff here is very warm, friendly, and efficient. Thanks for your time! 😄"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Very good place for breakfast. Delicious meal and courteous staff. Expect a wait but the staff are super efficient.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Such delicious food. The fruit bowl was amazing. Very fast service. Would definitely recommend
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great place to get some breakfast. There was a little bit of a line but it moved fast- I think we ended up only waiting 10-15 minutes. Had the eggs Benedict, blueberry pancakes, and washed it all down with some bloody Mary's. It's worth giving it a visit."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Amazing food. Bacon, fruit, and crab Benedict were best I’ve had. The mimosa flight is awesome. Really impressed by the quality here"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,One of the best breakfast places everything is always nice and hot and arrive is very fast .
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"What a breakfast 😋 set us up for most of the day. So much choice on the menu. We sat outside did have a look indoors not that much "" Hollywood"" as such. Excellent and efficient service 👍"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Great breakfast and brunch. Waiting line can look scary but moves fast. Good service.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"It was really nice Sunday breakfast, there was a queue but we sat in a short time. Servers were very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious. I had better service and food than i expected. Thank you!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"This place was awesome. Great breakfast with super generous portions. Their two egg breakfast scramble was easily three eggs. Hash browns are great, crispy the way I like them. Their staff was also very friendly and helpful!!!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Hands down best breakfast I've had. Absolutely amazing! Great service!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Fast service, and the mushroom gravy was amazing."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"My family and I ate here every morning while being in San Francisco. Very good breakfast, especially the French Toast and Pancakes. Definitely would recommend."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Best breakfast in San Francisco near Hotel Zoe.  We went there twice.  Everything is delicious, but I especially enjoyed the classic benedict."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Good Morning SFO, fresh orange juice and freshly brewed coffee. Lots of breakfast options,you can custom with pancakes or waffles whatever you like, staff is very helpful and friendly. Ranchero tacos are great,with few eggs and sourdough bread with fresh house-made butter."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,I got the dolce French toast with no powdered sugar. It was delish. Quaint breakfast nook near fisherman's wharf.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great place for a scrumptious breakfast.  The fresh fruit makes every plate standout.  Busy and a bit pricey, but worth it!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"A tiny little brunch spot with yummy food ! I had their fresh orange juice and tried a two-egg dish called Rancheros which came with a side of toasts and hashbrown. Loved the food and the vibe of the place!! Only down side of this cafe is it closes pretty early and has a long wait on most days, so make sure you come on time and have time up your sleeves."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Super small place, decent food, but very crowded, and you feel like you're eating with the table mates next to you as if they are sitting at your table."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Busiest place I've seen, waited outside 10 min before opening at 7am and 10 people showed up to get a seat. My eggs benedict were delicious special ordered with avocado and tomato. However, chilaquiles sold at this place are NOT authentic chilaquiles: totopos on the side of scrambled eggs with the cold salsa on top is not what I expected. The bread and coffee's good."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Outstanding... !!!! Our First time there .. We had our Daughter's Birthday Breakfast there before going to the Pier and The Aquarium... Excellent Food .. Big Portions.. Great Service... Thank you so much guys ... CHEERS and SEMPER FIDELIS.....!!!!!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Visiting my daughter at college and our first choice for breakfast was unexpectedly under renovation. Found this nice little place on phone search. Only had to wait 10mins in line. Service was great, pleasant and food came out quickly after we ordered. We both had French toast, eggs and sausage. They added some good tasting fruit (bananas, strawberries, blackberries and orange slices) on the side. Everything was good! Pricey like most things in SF."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,The food was amazing and well presented. We went during the week and there was about a 10 min wait. We were seated outside but the weather was perfect and we were wearing sweaters.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Best breakfast we had in San Francisco Definitely the place to go for a perfect breakfast and start your day strong :) Thanks
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"The Hollywood Cafe was a great stop on our adventure around San Francisco.  My wife and I had no idea how busy the place was going to be and when we arrived the line was outside on the curb.  The wait was only a few minutes despite the long line and after ordering, our breakfast was out in minutes.  The BAT Scrambled Eggs and Morning Wrap were a good way to start the day.  With a longer line by the time we were finishing our food and the wait staff's overly attentiveness we did feel a bit rushed, but that did not sour the overall experience.  I would definitely recommend the Hollywood Cafe, especially if you plan to continue your morning at Fisherman's Wharf."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Wow one of the highest rated places for breakfast and it's under rated! Great service and food was special. Just check out the pics of the steak and eggs and the crab Benedict. Nice presentation that was totally unexpected. Can't wait to go back.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Fantastic service. Can accommodate for vegan/vegetarian options. The food here is great! For seafood lovers, would recommend crab Benedict."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,One of the best breakfast diners in SF..pancakes are amazing
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Pancakes were as expected- fluffy and delicious. They have seating both inside and outside. There is no waitlist and you wait in line to be seated. We showed up on the later side of breakfast around 11:30 am and maybe only waited 15 minutes to be seated.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Vibrant atmosphere with excellent customer service.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Delicious and generous breakfast!!. Kind and attentive staff.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Great food and decent serving size. Not cheap, but then nothing in SF is. Service was quick and efficient. Hash burrito was awesome."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Third time here. Everything has been delicious. Could eat the sour dough toast all day. My wife and I always stop here whenever we are in San Francisco.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Great food !! Wish they opened earlier and stayed opened later . We would have ate there breakfast lunch and dinner !! Fast service as well
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,The food was really great! Everything tasted awesome. The kitchen was open to see which was really cool! Service was okay. You basically have to ask for ice even just for water. All in all a pretty great little place.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Waited in a short little line once they opened...come hungry...the Ranchero was a fabulous lightened version...yummy fresh fruit
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Best breakfast ever!! The food was so fresh and delicious!! Great customer service. We had the crab Benedict and the crab omelet. The coffee was tasty, and their fesh fruit was so fresh and sweet. Love, love, love this place!!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Breakfast was delicious. Service was quick. Will definitely return.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Excellent food and service loved it.. they have a great selection for breakfast.. fresh fruit.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Hands down the best hashbrowns I've ever eaten! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The omelette was also the perfect ""fluffyness."" The staff were great and didn't mind making something not on the menu to accommodate my food allergies."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Way Over price, Not that great, server was NOT friendly at ALL,    Daren’s Cafe around the corner or Boudin.   Is WAY Better choices."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,The breakfast was absolutely great. Nicely located near the tourist attractions but far enough not to be crowded.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,The food is very nice but definitely not worth the long queue. No different from any other American breakfast
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Absolutely fantastic!! Not only was the service friendly and prompt, the food itself was beautiful and yummy.  I’m glad we chose to stop here for breakfast!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Food was pretty good service was not to bad I just wouldn't ask for a coffee from here again. Gratitude was automatically charged for a party of 5 18%
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,The best breakfast in San Francisco the food was excellent an the staff the same 10/10 every morning simply THE BEST
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"A great albeit expensive breakfast place in a prime location.  We waited for about 20 minutes and line for table moved quickly.  Service was brisk but friendly.  Fresh OJ and coffee were excellent along with my benedict and girls pancakes.  Meal was expensive, but you are in a tourist location so I'm not sure what people expect.  What they can be fairly sure of is a great meal and service."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"True to its name there are photos of old time Hollywood stars on the walls. We went for breakfast. The pancakes looked pretty but, they were a bit rubbery. The fruit was nice and fresh. I also had a side order of bacon. Can't go wrong with bacon."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Food is good but they close 90mins before what google maps show so plan accordingly
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Friendly staff, great food! The fresh fruit was a real treat. The bacon was perfect.  Pancakes were large, the scramble was filling and the omelet was filled with plenty."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Amazing breakfast.Great customer service. Beautiful sunny day to eat outside.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Breakfast sandwich can feed 2. We ate here twice and split both days. Very attentive waitstaff on coffee refills. Outside seating in “COVID-19 cover” built on street.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Nice well served breakfast
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Worth the wait. Terrific breakfast items- not ""wow"" or ""unique"" but simple food, made well, with nice portions and speedy service. Their ""Sweet Bacon"" - steeped in orange juice, maple syrup, and a few secret ingredients is a must have, unless you prefer crisp bacon ONLY. Coffee was a nice blend, served very hot. Everything was priced well. Not a value, but what in S.F. is??? Go and enjoy."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Pretty good little cafe  Decently Priced, Good Food, Good Service  The banana chocolate chip pancakes are good"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Words escape me, partially because I’m in a state of slumber after the size of that breakfast but mostly because it was awesome! Hash burrito containing what must have been a 10-egg omelette, ham, cheese, hash browns, avocado, fresh tomato salsa - wow. Delicious refillable filter coffee, orange juice and attentive service.  Nothing but 5* from all of us. This is a must do for anybody wanting to experience an American breakfast."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,I ordered salmon scramble egg with house coffee and the taste was amazing! Especially the hash browns they serve are so crispy! Definitely visit again!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"I had the egg breakfast with bacon. While this on its own was pretty good, I went a little extra to get my hash browns ""Hollywood"" style. That was phenomenal. If you eat here, I highly recommend doing that. This place had a slight waiting line outside before being seated. Don't let that discourage you. It moves fast, and is proof that they do a tasty breakfast."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Delicious and attractive food, attentive service and reasonable prices for brunch or lunch. 6 kinds of eggs Benedict! Amazing huge hash browns!"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Wow this is a fantastic breakfast venue, so generous with their servings. Fresh pilled on food with wonderful selections. The ‘hash browns’ are enormous - they literally cover a whole plate.  We were recommended by the concierge at our hotel and we couldn’t believe our luck. This place is popular and it’s easy to see why.  The value for money and freshness of food is “top noch” - best value I’ve found. Service is friendly and fast.  Do yourself a favour and try this place when your down near Fishermans Wharf in San Francisco, I’m sure you’ll be pleased."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"I came across this place while heading to the Fisherman's Wharf in SF. I Googled them and saw they had excellent reviews so I went for breakfast. I'm glad I did. The food was excellent, good, attentive staff. Not much more I could ask for. I went early so I was seated quickly, but they definitely get busy with a line, so be prepared to wait. I will definitely return on my next trip to SF."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"This place is sneaky good. It's a small place that's located a block off of the main tourist area. The food is very good, with healthy portions and is one of the more reasonably priced places in the area. The service was great, food was quick and an overall great experience."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Not sure to understand why this is a famous place for having breakfast. It was fine but nothing you can't find anywhere else.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Amazing place for breakfast. Convenient location in Fisherman’s wharf. We went there for 5 consecutive days and breakfast and service was always excellent. Whether it’s the fruit bowl, French toast, eggs Benedict or omelette out 3 teenage boys where always happy! Not cheap but very generous portions."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Very very good address. One of the best breakfast that i have eaten. We find there lot of choice with a large portion. Very good ambiance. I love it !!
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Great service with generous portions. Cost was actually a little cheaper than most in the area. Wait time for seating was less than 10 min. Best breakfast I had all week.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Excellent food and service. Very quick and all the food was delicious.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Enjoyed breakfast here. Crab omelette was superb and a pleasant surprise considering I’m not the biggest fan of crab.
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Cute little diner in the tourist area. We had no wait for seating, delicious food, well cooked. There is a movie theme going on, if that's not obvious from the name."
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Delicious breakfast!! You have to queue a bita for a table but it worths.... When you are almost finish the waiters bring you the bill informing you that you can pay when you are ready.... they are pushing you to fisnish your breakfast in a very nice way as they have people quequing outside.....
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,"Good food, kind of pricey. If you get the chilaquiles, don't expect to get what you would get at a Mexican restaurant. The chorizo is served as a sausage and the chips are placed on the side (tostitos) 🤷🏻‍♀️ …"
Hollywood Cafe,530 North Point St,Delicious breakfast and the best assorted fruit bowl with our meal.  Fast service.  Seating inside or out.  Open kitchen.
