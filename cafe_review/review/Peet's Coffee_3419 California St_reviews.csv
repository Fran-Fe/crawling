Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,Sasha is awesome! I'm the pain that comes in 10 min to close ordering a travel box to go. The whole team here makes me happy I switched to Peets. Thank you!
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Very good service Coffee and help. But today the latte temperature too low,  also they charge ""Surcharge Healthy SF"" with 4% when a lot of restaurants or coffee shops don't charge anymore. I am Unsatisfied with this interaction. Within previous transactions I was never charged for such payment.  ☕🍵🥐 …"
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"I do seasonal work around the neighborhood, and I always get a poorly made drink. I love Peet's Coffee elsewhere. I usually get a chocolate & caramel javiva swirl. It's basically a frappe. The issue is that there's usually something wrong with it at this establishment. My last and final time it was not properly blended. Right off the back I could tell it was off. I will attach some pictures so you can see it's more of an ice coffee with with crushed ice over a frappe. I would request a new one but I'm just over it. Previously when I have complained they get rude and loud. In my opinion, it's a way of making sure it seems like I'm just some poor brown person complaining (clientele is mainly affluent White people). I love Peet's Coffee, but I will never return to this particular establishment. It's just hopeless."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Stiff staff ""how can I help"" (dropping the word ""you"") and asking from across the room.  Formalized to the point they often get the order wrong (each order taker should fill the order, not pass it to someone else who will get the order second hand).  It's just a coffee with milk, not a latte or something. Not my first time to this Peet's but likely my last"
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,SO AMAZING ITS SOOOOO GOOD. VANILLA ICED LATTE…. SOOOOOO GOOD. I LOVE.
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Great location, always very swift with the mobile orders... Thank you, Peet's team! I really like that there is an additional exit in the back. Super convenient. Bathroom has no code so, it is only locked if there is someone in there. I genuinely just love this location because it is significantly more spacious than most Peet's locations."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"A well run Pete's.  Staff is good.  I see no discrimination or dehumanization you often see in San Francisco coffee shops.  They do a good job with a smile on their face.   The only downside at this location is some customers thinking bathing in cologne or perfume makes them alpha sexy, when it really just shows they have no class.  But this is beyond staff's control, it's just a reality of the neighborhood.  There is plenty of parking and shopping nearby.  There is some seating indoors and outdoors.  There are a few outlets.  Everything is as it should be.  Manager deserves a raise or promotion."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,Iced pumpkin caramel macchiato! Iced white chocolate strawberry mocha! Pride cookie!
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,The cashier was super nice. The barista must have been having a bad day.
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,it costs 6$((it is very sad
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,It’s so so good but they always make my drink wrong and I have to tell them to remake it the way I ordered it.
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,Always a good morning coffee..makes the day starting fresh and awake... great coffee and excellent service. Thanks
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"This shop was at the SF airport, coffee was just okay and pricey not sure I would get it again.  However, on the positive side they had a monkey cake that was awesome, that I get again. Service was not friendly, cashier was distracted and didn't seem to care much. They were not busy when I was there do there was no reason for anyone to feel overwhelmed."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"The queue was long when I arrived but the staff were highly proactive in speeding up the process. I ordered a small skinny half sweet Havana cappuccino. The staff helpfully explained that both small and medium drinks had two shots, and as I only wanted one shot that morning, she promptly adjusted down the price. No complaints. I also appreciate that you can go online as a guest and not sign up to receive advertisements."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,It was wet and rainy out and a little blustery but it was nice and warm inside and there are plenty open tables when we got there. Isabella was practicing for a Christmas ballet show and this was the closest location to the dance studio. The free Internet and the ample display of food and pastries made the wait go by quickly. For the next Christmas show we would drive over here instead of walking as there is plenty of parking in the lot behind the store.
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"I think Peet's is great, and like their beans the best of all the larger stores. Sometimes I'll get a snack but mostly I come for the beans. All of the SF locations have great friendly staff and this one is no exception."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Peet's Laurel Village is filled with everything you expect: friendly, knowledgeable staff,  smiles and great coffee.  This Peet's team have been noticeably ""extra"" during the pandemic, uber patient and accommodating. Stop by when you're in the hood or on your way out of town."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Being a regular customer for five years, I will no longer honor Peet's as they would not honor a 20% discount on beans when they see me each and every morning. I addressed this the very next morning, and management at this Peet's said, You'll need to write to corporate. I feel that in this impersonal environment, I cannot linger give my business to this corporation, as Alfred Peet would have certainly not batted an eye for a regular customer."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Update your Postmates menu to reflect that you are NOT selling food! Poor customer service, especially not to inform your customers. Hopefully ppl will read this review so they know since you aren't communicating that to us. Sad to have had my last 3 Postmates orders have couriers shows up empty handed even though your app shows you have food items...."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"Peet's has the strongest coffee, and I love it!!! 👊🏽"
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,"We're peetnicks, for sure. We get on our kick scooters and pre-order a large oat milk latte to share and sit outside for some quality Presidio Heights people watching."
Peet's Coffee,3419 California St,One of the busier peet's I've been too. The cashier wasn't as responsive as I'd like but other than that its the same as any other peet's experience i've had.
