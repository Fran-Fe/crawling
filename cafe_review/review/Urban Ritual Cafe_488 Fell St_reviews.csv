Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"One of the best boba spots I visited during my weekend stay in the bay! It is downtown so there's gonna be a lack of parking everywhere, so be aware of that.  The spot is quaint and very cozy. You do order through a kiosk and it's easy to pick what you want since it has photos and description of drinks. I don't think the menu at the top of the store's cashier area is updated though.  I do love my boba, so my partner and I got 4 boba drinks to try.  Not pictured: Matcha Toffee - very strong matcha flavor but sweet enough that it was balanced well. The toffee brittle was a nice touch of sweetness at the end.  Gold Winter was my least favorite because it's very jasmine forward and the tea was burnt cuz it left a bitter aftertaste. The drink is pretty though because it has gold edible glitter but the drink itself, I wasn't a fan of. I couldn't even taste the smoked Wintermelon in it and the honey. It was just jasmine green tea.  Feed Me Ube and Creme Brulee were my favorites. The Ube drink was very coconutty and Ube was prominent throughout the drink. It does have Ube puree so I enjoyed that a lot. The creme brulee drink wasn't very sweet buuuuut the creme brulee bits made it much better because it was sweet and toasted. Think of burnt caramel bits. It had that nice bitterness that added to the complexity of the drink. It balanced out the unsweetened milk tea base!  Best part was that the boba was QQ!! It was consistent throughout the drinks we ordered. If the boba is made well, I know the drinks will be great too! I would love to come back here one day! Or better yet, please open up a store in SoCal!!!!"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"urban ritual was on my list for the longest time! im so glad i was able to try it when i was in sf. the drinks we got were pretty sweet but i didn't mind too much since i have a huge sweet tooth! id recommend adjusting the sugar level if you're not a fan of sugar tho! the creme brulee was very creamy and added a nice thick texture to the strawberry milk! i was also a big fan of the crunchy torched toffee bits in the matcha!  they always have diff seasonal drinks, unique specials , and their everyday classics! ill have to come back someday to try their other drinks :p  what we got: - matcha toffee - strawberry creme brulee  ig: @whatsviveating"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Milk tea is watery and doesn’t taste strong tea flavor… came here bc of good reviews, but not my favorite compared to other boba spots I’ve been"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Phew, just beat the rush. Decided to be adventurous and ordered a iced matcha milk tea with honey boba with less sugar and regular milk. Tasty taste! The boba was chewy and had the right amount of sweetness, which paired well with the matcha. They have a cute nook which is awesome for some light reading. Can get loud with the long line though~ $5 tax included is a great price for my drink. Will be coming back to try the classic!"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Was very surprised did nit know what to expect thought it was just like any other boba place, I ordered the cream brûlée friend ordered the matcha witch he enjoyed"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Right when you walk in there is a nice aroma and a friendly greeting from one of the staff.  This is cozy place to kick back and go on the internet or hang with someone while drinking some tea.  Well, when you manage to find parking (I recommend taking public transportation or else you'll be waiting forever to find one).  I heard about this place on Yelp, and after looking at all the good reviews there I thought it would live up to the taste.  Never before have a ever been so disappointed in boba tea before.  I got the Matcha Toffee and Creme Brulee, which was okay.  The looks were good, but the taste didn't live up to expectations or the price.  I usually like matcha stuff by this was just not up to snuff.  It would have been better if it a stronger matcha taste and if the toffee bits were a little smaller.  They were big and couldn't be sucked up the straw.  The Creme Brulee was definitely better.  The boba was pretty good (this being said from a person that doesn't like boba).  It is made fresh there so this came out soft and hot.  There is also a pudding and sugar that makes it sweet but not too sweet.  Although, the goodness of the Creme Brulee milk tea doesn't outway the priceyness or the disappointing taste of the Matcha Toffee.  Very likely not going here again."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"At first, I thought it was going to be another mediocre boba place. But I gave it a few shots and now I stop by fairly frequently. The matcha is a good, deep flavour. The boba are a good chewiness. The other toppings are keeping up with the latest variety including aloe and lychee. I especially like the drinkable mochi. Their experimental flavours are excellent, like the mango sticky rice. Feed Me Ube is really good, definitely worth trying.  Their COVID-19 contactless ordering procedure is quick and easy to follow. They have touchscreens for in-store orders and a Square online for ordering ahead. I'm glad to help support Urban Ritual, and they keep me filled with fun.  If you do plan to sit in-store for a while, be aware that it's usually pretty noisy from the music or general background sounds."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Nice coming here for a sugar splurge. The creme brulee drink is so food. Easy in and out quick service since you order yourself using a terminal pos. Never had an issue with my order. Packed well and consistently good
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"I am a Certified Boba Boy and I love Boba... and Urban Ritual makes some creative drinks, combining milk teas w/ purees & syrups to create a refreshing drink.  We got the Creme Brulee and it was deliciously mixed in with caramelized/toasted bits that made it fun. The Bae-sil is a strawberry lemonade with a bite of basil, making it really refreshing  @phidingthefam"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,I won’t complain because of how hard it is to park because that is what cringe people do but I have been to many boba stores and this is the weirdest one I’ve been to. The boba was fresh and good but the half and half was not good. And they gave me sugar separately and make me put it in myself.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Creme brulee topping is a must try like everyone said. It tasted like it was made from high quality ingredients not like other tea places. Although my strawberry drink still wasn't a hit for me, I would go back to try other drinks they have to offer."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Boba: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Overall: Compared to others I feel like the flavor was a little watered down.  The extended review...  Boba:  White Grape Yuzu - 3/5 - I ordered online and got no ice with regular sweetness.  I think the flavor itself was a little hard to taste.  It definitely tasted a little more watered down.  The boba and the aloe vera was good.  Boba was nice and chewy and the aloe had a nice texture to it.  Service: 4/5 - Friendly service.  Ambiance: 4/5 - A cute shop in the middle of Hayes Valley.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,We arrived at this nice cozy place and the staff we're very friendly. We got house milk teas that were lovely for a cold morning.  They also have matcha mochi muffins. They had a really light matcha flavor and the texture was something I had never tried before. It was a unique experience and tasted incredible.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"First time I've ever been here and it won't be the last! The creme brulee milk tea was so delicious the boba was warm, was not disappointed!"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Don’t mess around, you’re coming here for the creme brûlée pudding they make in house. You can add it to any drink, and you absolutely should. It’s super soft and silky, and it tastes like a custard not like the traditional egg pudding you find from other boba places. It’s so soft you need to be extra careful when mixing your drink because the pudding could dissolve! They also give you caramelized sugar pieces on the side that you add yourself, but I personally don’t think the drink needs it.  I ordered the creme brûlée milk tea $6.50 and it comes with honey boba and the pudding. I got regular sweet (70%) and thought it was perfectly sweetened. I will say this drink is about the toppings, not so much the tea, one could argue the tea just wasn’t strong enough. If you really want to taste the tea I’m not sure this is the drink for you."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Must order via tablet if walk in. Bubble tea was good and there’s no seating inside. The cup and aesthetics are very cute.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,The creme brulee drink is super good! This is one of my favorite boba stops in SF
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"OH MY GOD why did I not come here sooner when my hair stylist suggested it a month ago?!! I ordered the Creme Brûlée Milk Tea and WOW. It was amazing. I have been having boba drinks since 2002 and search for the best boba drinks all over the world. I have to say that the milk(regular), tea, creme brûlée, and boba were incredible. The drink itself wasn’t sweet when I took the first 2 sips but once you stir it around a bit you will find a perfect blend of sweetness from the brûlée and the DELICIOUS honey boba. I am so delighted when I get warm, perfectly made boba and this was 10/10 for me! The message on the cup was so cute and you also get a side of crunchy torched brown sugar to add and honestly you don’t even need it. Although I did try it and it was yummy but it was too crunchy to mix with the softness of the boba and brûlée. The Creme Brûlée is cooked perfectly and just so DELICIOUS. Worth every penny of the $6.25 plus tip(the drink includes the boba and brûlée) I can’t wait to come back for more!  6/28/21 I came back for another Creme Brûlée Milk Tea and added the Jasmine Green Tea under Classics with Honey Boba 50% sweet. It was very sweet still even for me because of the honey boba but AMAZING. I can taste the quality of the tea and again the boba was fresh and delicious like my last visit. Also I’m addicted to the Creme Brûlée Milk tea. It is even better if that’s possible this time. This place is HANDS DOWN THE BEST IN THE BAY AREA. I will be coming here at least 2-3 times a week."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,This cafe gives off a very hyper-modern vibe.  You walk in and everything is plexiglass partitioned off.  There are two stands with tablets for ordering.  No human interaction at all.  Limited seating (meaning not enough) in a space that looked like it was just moved into - little decor.  A human calls your name to pick up the order.  They are known for creme brulee cream - add that to whatever you get - otherwise it is just your average boba shop.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Yummy boba and cool flavors! Very easy ordering and quick pick-up. We enjoyed the creme brûlée, and the mango sticky rice was good but didn’t taste true to the original flavor. Plus the chips from Singapore/Malaysia were delish."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"We ordered delivery a couple of times. I started to stick to their matcha toffee. It’s definitely perfect for matcha lovers. I like how the toffee tastes with matcha. I did try white grape yuzu as well. I personally think it’s a lack of flavors. Also, I tend to not order from them that often because it is not near my neighborhood and their drinks are somehow pricey with other delivery fees added."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Got the crème brûlée drink. Beware: there are two versions of this drink, one with milk tea and another with just milk. My body doesn’t handle caffeine well, so I always go for milk only drinks.  The crème brûlée is SO creamy and so good. It also optionally comes with torched sugar at the top, which can add a little bit of bitterness. This is my current goto boba order around the city!"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,i visited here on my trip to the bay area and this is probably my favorite boba place ever 🤗🤗🤗 they have rly nice flavor options and the boba was so good so yummy perfectly textured boba its firm but soft yet not mushy and nice and chewy 🙂👍 the boba pairs nicely with any of their drink variation and the flavor of their drinks so perfectly crafted so good 🥺😍🥰💋❤️🙈☺️
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Ordered vanilla latte (actually discussed it since advertised on door) received a regular latte when picking up ask if this is my vanilla latte answer was it was for me...  will go to blue bottle around the corner never had a problem there.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Real ingredients make this boba drink experience extraordinary.  I spent 3 days in San Francisco and each day I had to have their matcha toffee with boba and drinkable mochi.  My daughters tried other flavors and loved them all. Don't miss the opportunity!
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"The Drink I've heard about Urban Ritual from friends for a while, and finally got a chance to try it now. I ordered their House Milk Tea and my friend got the Creme Brulee, both with Honey Boba. The Creme Brulee my friend got was pretty interesting. It has good flavor with a mix of custard pudding and boba. The House Milk Tea has...in a sense a well balanced between milk and tea. They use a special house cream, which I can taste it being slightly unique compare to other milk teas. The boba was also done well and consistent throughout.  The Miscellaneous The cafe is on one of the busy main road, with limited street parking. The inside is small, with some simple but clean decor, and limited seating. The cafe does not have a restroom for customers? [Every coffee / tea shop should have restroom for customers]. Their service was pretty efficient, and the employees were sincere. They have a somewhat small menu when you compare it to other boba / tea places. They focus on their Specialty Drinks, Coffee, and Bites, while giving the option of make your own. Pricing is average for a specialty cafe. The cafe is worth a try with some of the unique selections they have."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"They charged me but forgot about my order? When asked about at the window they just gave me a random drink with nothing that I paid for or ordered. I sent it back for the correct one, drink was overly sweet wish I could have asked for my ice and sugar customizations."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"ordered the crème brulee and strawberry shortcake , tasted good but made both of us feel sick within five minutes of consumption (one of us threw up) lol"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"I went with some friends here for boba, it was decent. Would come again to try out other drinks but it's a bit far from my place"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,The ube drink was the best thing I had 😩
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Love this place for milk tea but it’s on the pricier side!  My favorite from here is the jasmine milk tea, you can really taste the tea flavors & it’s well balanced with the milk. The house milk tea is also good too, taste like black milk tea or Hong Kong milk tea. There’s a lot of seats & tables here so you can def come here with friends to hang or chat! They sometimes have samples out too so you can try the milk tea!  Tip: ask for less sweet, 50% or 80% was perfect to me!"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"We ordered a jasmine milk tea and house milk tea, both with less sugar. I can’t say I’m a tea connoisseur, but compared to generic boba places, the tea seems high quality. Tea to pearl ratio is low... too much boba! Pearls are chewy - my friend liked them, but too chewy for me, almost too saturated with liquid. Most of the pearl flavor comes from the syrup rather than the pearls themselves. The cups were plain and not cute like the yelp pictures led me to believe. Our conclusion: Boba Guys is better, but this place has some other fun flavors we will definitely come back to try."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Recommended by a friend for good reason. Quite a number of unique flavors here, but I opted for a classic strawberry milk bar. Wonderful drink!"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,The crème brûlée boba is one of my favorite boba drinks I’ve ever had! Loved the flavor and contrasting textures- this is definitely a dessert drink. My friend got the Hong Kong milk tea and it was fairly bitter so I recommend not getting below 50% sweetness. Would be nice if you didn’t have to order online but our drinks came out quickly. Would go back just for the crème brûlée!
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Fast wifi, great music, chill vibes, and delicious tea! Perfect spot to decompress after a long day walking around the city."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Love this place! Randomly found it on their opening week and it has become my go to milk tea place! They try to do new seasonal drinks every few months which is great. My favorite was their houjichas and cream which had their creme brulee topping and oreos! Only thing is I wish they had more milk based drinks instead of the fruit based ones.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,I thought they had lattes online it seemed that way but they don't and I don't feel employed were nice to my partner. All around I don't suggest going here.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"Note: -- No Bathroom --  Now that we've got that out of the way: the house milk tea is delightful. The black tea blend tastes predominantly like a roasted Assam tea, delivered through a soothing creamy texture. 30% sweetness hit the spot: the tea flavors really come through, but without any bitterness of wateriness. For the cost, I think the drink is slightly smaller than, for example, Teaspoon. Nevertheless, I would come back for the tea.  Service was friendly and welcoming. Not a place to study for a long time, given that there is no bathroom"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,I ALWAYS get the creme brûlée milk tea! They have the freshest boba that’s the perfect amount of chewiness. I love coming here but remember to order ahead online! They get busy sometimes
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Amazing creme brulee milk tea. 💕🍮 You get super bouncy and chewy boba with the mellow creme brulee pieces and roasted burnt creme brulee chips in a creamy milk tea. All the textures! ｡^‿^｡ …
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,So so so good!!! This place was recommended by a friend and it’s probably one of my favorite boba spots in California! I got the crime brûlée drink (with macadamia milk) and omg the burnt sugar with the crème brûlée was a game changer. The flavors came together so well but I downed my drink so fast. Would love to come back and try their other drinks! Price point is a bit expensive but it’s SF. Open one in SoCal plz
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,This place is amazing. The coconut vanilla latte is a hit. My only problem is that I can not get a bigger size. On the weekends I'll pair it with the avocado arugula red flake peppers with an egg on top. The staff is welcoming and greet you with a smile. It's the little things that separate establishments from one another and things like this go a long way in my eyes. Will proudly continue to support this place. Great work guys.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,love getting the matcha toffee at 30% sweet. very covid-conscious/pickup only. street parking can be tough
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Place had samples of the white grape oolong tea and decided to get it with honey yuzu and it greatly improved the drink. Drink had right amount of sweetness and tartness even though there were no adjustments.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Overall really great boba. I got the toffee matcha with honey boba with 30% sweet. I thought it was a little too sweet. It’ll probably be better with 0% sweet with boba or no boba with 30% sweet. Since toffee and boba are both sweet so my drink taste like 50-75% sweet.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"We had two creme brulee bubble teas, very good, very sweet"
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,boba texture was great! comparable to boba guys! We loved the earl grey and jasmine green tea! Crème brulee was too sweet but if you like the taste of flan you’ll definitely like the drink!
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,"We had the cloud and the creme brulee with oatmilk yesterday, and it was very disappointing. The creme brulee cost 7$ and was honestly the most disappointing boba tea I've ever had. It barely had any distinct notes and pretty much felt like a really mild milkshake where someone forgot to add any flavor. The cloud wasn't much better either and very underwhelming.  The service was really really quick inspite of many people waiting in line, and that was really amazing."
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,Their “afternoon tea” just tastes like chocolate milk. What a waste of six dollars. Maybe other items on the menu are better.
Urban Ritual Cafe,488 Fell St,A population Hayes Valley boba tea shop with a great variety of drinks.
