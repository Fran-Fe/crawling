Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"We had a great breakfast at this place. The portions were huge and really tasty. We tried the breakfast burrito, which was crispy, savory and tasty. We also had the chicken adobo bowl, which was huge and really tasty, too!"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Best brunch I had in SF. They cooked me a customized version of one of their toasts adding broccolini to it up to my preferences and it was really tasty and made with love. You gotta try it
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Stopped here for breakfast and had a wonderful experience. The service was incredibly friendly (above and beyond the norm). Small space with a cozy farmhouse feel. The bread for the breakfast sandwich was great, soft and pillowy."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Wow this place is awesome! My first time here I got the cortado and beef empanada and both were spectacular! The tamarind sauce made the whole thing come together.  Also the lady working was extremely nice too (offered to put the sugar in the coffee before she made the milk), walked me through the menu, etc.  Overall a great experience, with cool options. Can’t wait to go back for lunch next time 🙌🏽"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"What a fantastic breakfast place. Here visiting from florida, and they were so accommodating to making my kids something for breakfast that wasn’t on the menu. Service was top notch and the food was absolutely delicious."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Really great customer service here and the food was healthy and delicious! shout out to who I believe was the owner who checked on us and made us feel welcome at this little cafe!

Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Best place for coffee in SF!  The friendliness of this place is ... I don’t even have words. Love you guys and for knowing my drink!  I have the Sherpa coffee and it’s not everyone. I love it and have it every morning I can.
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,if you're looking for bullet proof coffee - sherpa coffee near union square of you haven't had breakfast and you're sleepy. atmosphere is great. coffee is good! friendly staff. the place is quite small though and the community table is dirty. I'm a clean freak lol

Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Breakfast sandwich with avocado was SO GOOD! Love this place
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Walked here from target to get a coffee and found they were closed 15mins before their listed hours of operation. The lady who responded to my knocking said they were closing early for Memorial Day… bad business
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Breakfast burritos is okay, coffee is soso"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Good meals, great taste, great portions, easy to order ahead and pick up. Try the bowls, all of them are delicious  Good salads"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"This is a true gem in the SF Financial District. The aesthetic is reminiscent of cafes and eateries in Midtown Manhattan; subway tile, wood accents, full espresso counter, etc. You can’t go wrong grabbing coffee here but the food menu is awesome locally sourced California based breakfast and lunch items. Quality food, decent prices being in SF, and friendly staff. Added plus is if you’re a celiac like me or gluten sensitive, they have great options."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Absolutely loved this place - nicest people and great food. Helped me pick something out and it was delicious.
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,I love this place for both breakfast and lunch. Food and service is amazing. Chicken bowl and Bob's Cobb are two favorites.
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Amazing service and freakin amazing French toasts
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,20% Automatic tip on just one takeout order is ridiculous
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Absolutely fantastic everything here Can't recommend enough Thank you
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Cozy, small and comfortable Cafe. The staff is nice and helpful. The coffee is good but unfortunately served in paper cups instead of mugs/proper cups."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"I always come for the Can't Stop the Beet salad and a cappuccino and I always leave full and happy. These folks are so friendly, they make dank coffee, and they clearly value quality in everything they do. I love the vibe of this cafe and cannot recommend it enough for a healthy, quick lunch or for a coffee date with friends."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,The roasted potatoes are bomb. Perfect amount of garlic and salt and crunchy goodness. Would definitely come here again.
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Best avocado toast I had in my life!
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"This is a real gem of a coffee spot! I was visiting San Francisco from out of town and looking for a place where I could get a 'butter coffee' (aka bulletproof). The Sherpa coffee here was perfect - grassfed butter, MCT oil, great coffee, all blended for you on the spot. Had a chance to sample some food as well - delicious! Fast service and friendly staff. I'll be back the next time I'm in town! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,Cafe with pretty nice and casual ambience. I only bought their avocado toast and egg sandwich for breakfast. Avocado toast was pretty good. I added scrambled eggs on top of it. Egg sandwich was not bad but not as gd as the avocado toast.
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"I came here for breakfast and I would not recommend. I tend to be the type of guy who judges a place on their egg sandwich and this one was sub par. To start service was veeeery slow, the bacon egg and cheese came to over $10 (huge red flag), the bread was thick and stale and there was no ketchup to add... so that’s a no for me"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"A very nice cafe with very friendly staff. The coffee tastes great, also I can highly recommend the avocado bread."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"This may just become my new go-to lunch spot in the Financial District. Food-wise, the menu is comprised mostly of soups, salads, and sandwiches. Everything is very fresh and the ingredients are high-quality. I got the baby kale caesar salad with chicken, and the portion was quite generous. My gf got the Shake Your Banh Banh sandwich, which, in addition to having a clever name, was delicious. Pretty affordable, too."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"*BIRD FEATHER IN MY SALAD* Yesterday was my first time at foundation cafe, I ordered through Caviar to save time on my lunch. I ordered the All Kale Caesar, and my coworkers Personal Cheezus. Walked back to my office ate my salad happily with my coworker. 1. salad was good 2. cheap I had a quarter of my salad left until I crunched on something hard, I thought...kale? I crunched on it again and pulled it out of my mouth. It was a bird feather.  I walked back upset that i ate nearly all my salad and found something terrifying and unsettling. I talked to a young lady and she apologized, and grabbed Charles, the manager. 1. He didn't even acknowledged me, only handed me a new salad. -after I said I would not like the salad, I would like a refund he apologized and said I would have to call Caviar because I ordered through there. -If I found out a feather was in my customers salad, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY CALL THEM MYSELF. Charles only requested my salad to be refunded. Seriously? I would have refunded my whole order (I ordered my coworkers) 2. He never told me where the feather came from. When I asked he blamed Bi-Rite, and then offered me a free coffee card.  after that, I took the salad, bc I was not satisfied or happy and Caviar did reach out. Charles should have told me not to worry about calling Caviar, instead of making me more stressed about the situation.  It was not professional how this was handled, I hope future customers will never have to go through this experience."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"My go to breakfast in SF, the avocado toast (add the egg on top) is amazing. As is the coffee (get the Sherpa Coffee if you need a boost). Best still, the staff are amazing, and always welcoming."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Nice little cafe on popular Kearny Street. There are a couple of tables but mostly it's a place where people who work in the neighborhood get lunch to go. They have a selection of sandwiches, soups and salads. I had the tomato ginger soup and it was fine."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"I love their shake your banh banh. It looked okay, but it tasted amazing. Also, their salads are great too. It’s not the cheapest place around, but they know what they are doing."
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,"Coffee was fantastic. bf-sando was actually bad. they tried to be too clever it feels like, but the outcome was all around terrible"
Foundation Cafe,335 Kearny St,I thought the food was good. The prices were reasonable and there was a nice variety on the menu. I like the atmosphere and would definitely come back again.
