Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"nice place to get a boba and lunch. I got the tiramisu latte (came with a cookie!!) with 50% sugar and boba, my friends got different milk tea bobas and banh mis.  The banh mis were amazing, we were raving about them. they tasted fresh and great  The boba... we tried each other's and couldn't stop saying ""the coffee is coffee"" and ""the tea is tea"" 😆  which means to us that the flavor tasted like real tea/coffee, not premade or anything. The tiramisu latte had a strong coffee flavor and tasted very fresh and good!! I loved the non-sweetness but if you are expecting a sweet treat make sure to get 100% sugar, they don't overdo it with the sugar here :)  The boba texture is good but not very sweet which I actually do prefer sometimes. It could be better but I was satisfied Overall great and can't wait for another run here"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"My experience was highly disappointing due to the associate's poor service. Despite requesting fresh milk tea with cream foam, they recommended other options and discouraged my choice of lavender milk tea. I ended up paying $7 for a basic oolong tea without milk, which I didn't enjoy. Moreover, when I asked for a replacement, they refused, leaving me feeling scammed and dissatisfied with the overall experience."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Service was quick and coffee was good. There’s a lot of seats and a restroom for customers.
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Ordered the avocado toast and hojicha green milk tea. Toast was nice ($7+), but milk tea wasn't good, very watery and couldn't taste the hojicha at all. I get 0% sugar for all my milk teas so I can taste the tea flavour, but this one didn't had any."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Been here half a dozen times, specifically for the strawberry horchata tea. Can’t find anything else like it and I’d highly recommend everyone come and order it!"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Cute little cafe. I liked to go there if I wanted to hang around Haight st. Smoothies are awesome!
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Tasty place with fresh ingredients. Best strawberry matcha in the city with good sandwich options and bagels. Perfect for morning.
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Such a cute little spot! I loved the smoothie I got here, and the breakfast bagel was delicious."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Amazing breakfast sandwich made to order (cooked it after I ordered, is not microwaved egg or pre-made). Kind people. Quick service!"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"A ""go to"" place for refreshing drinks. Nice to sit outside and watch ""life"" go by. Small place that can  get busy fast."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Wake Cup Blast is very sweet and delicious. Big menu with lots of fun boba and coffee drinks and toasts and sandwiches.
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Great location and feel to this shop. Plus they have great options on the menu and top quality ingredients! Such a great find.
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"We moved to this area ~6 months ago, and Wake Cup has become our go-to breakfast spot. Their Omelet Tortilla Breakfast Wrap is consistently incredible. Fantastic, fresh ingredients! Their avocado toast is also great.  Their tea/coffee drink menu a full of variety, and they offer number of unique specialty drinks. It's worth sampling all the 'starred' drinks. Again, their ingredients here are excellent. Their coffee has never been bland/burnt (unlike some other spots nearby).  And the staff is super friendly!"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Delicious breakfast sandwiches and great coffee! To be honest, I want expecting the coffee to be good given my past experiences at places like this. They made a great quality cappuccino. My only critique is that they don't have veggie sausage."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"New to the neighborhood, Wake Cup fills an important niche with a welcoming atmosphere and impressive array of food and drinks. The decor and calm music give off a cozy vibe that contrasts with the bustle and craziness of Haight just outside. The service here was top notch. The two young people running this place know what great customer service is and are proactive in making your experience positive. Despite being busy, the lady behind the counter got orders out quickly. The roasted oolong latte I had was delicious, and I was able to adjust the sweetness level to my liking. Highly recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood. You won't be disappointed."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Solid breakfast sandwiches, bagels, etc. for a reasonable price. They also have boba."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Delicious and adorable little coffee shop. Matcha milk tea with boba was sooo good
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Worst boba tea I’ve ever had. I got taro milk tea with boba. The purple paste was chunky and not dispersed through the drink. Tasted watery. I normally don’t like a lot of sugar, but this taro milk tea was watery..  Supreme Avocado toast did not deliver value for money. Should be priced at $5 rather than $10. Was very small  Lox bagel was good tho. Would recommend that"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"This is my FAVORITE boba place in the Bay Area. The ingredients are quality, the tea is super tasty, and the staff is so sweet and helpful. They make a lot of their tea latte components in house with wholesome healthy ingredients and boba is an add on.  Their homemade taro milk is my all time favorite and their strawberry syrup is a must try.  Support this business! It’s a win win!"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Delicious, fast, and organic ingredients. The bagels and breakfast sandwiches are great, love the boba, dirty horchata and house-made vanilla syrup."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,I love this place. Not only is the coffee delicious but they offer a particularly good lox bagel as well. The folks who work there are kind and quick. Be sure to grab a punch card because you’ll likely be back!
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Had just tried Wake Cup shortly before Shelter-In-Place and it has now become a quarantine staple! **Their breakfast sandwiches are the best in the Haight**(Don’t forget to order them Super, w/ avocado, sautéed mushrooms, and spinach. The combination is truly otherworldly). Wake Cup’s espresso drinks are well-made, on par with Ritual or the Cafe at Haight Street Market (my other go-to’s for coffee). They have lots of delicious tea and boba options as well! I like the lychee green tea and I recently got their taro bubble tea which blew my mind it was so good. Wake Cup’s to-go window makes it so you do not have to enter an enclosed space whether you’re placing or picking up an order. Their staff is incredibly friendly and knows us by name and remembers our order! Definitely don’t sleep on this place if you live in the neighborhood, are ordering food to be delivered, or are just passing through. It’s a local business that deserves to thrive!"
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,"Wake cup is a great little cafe with a nice variety of drinks, sandwiches, and other bites at a good price. There are a lot of vegetarian/vegan options as well. I personally enjoyed the veggie sandwich."
Wake Cup,1476 Haight St,Taro tea didn't have nearly enough taro. Spicy beef sandwich was pretty good. My partner had a banh mi that was ok.
