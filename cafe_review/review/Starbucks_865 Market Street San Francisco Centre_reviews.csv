Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"I ventured to this coffee haven in search of a much-needed pick-me-up, and boy, did I hit the jackpot with the Iced Caramel Macchiato - QUAD style! With each sip, I felt an invigorating rush of energy that filled me with the motivation to tackle the day ahead. Although I may not have worked all day, I can confidently say that this coffee creation was a game-changer. Kudos to the talented team who crafted this masterpiece - you truly outdid yourselves!"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Made an order through the mobile app for only a banana loaf . It was not taken out the plastic nor heated up. It was an online order which means they had time to heat it up. Just because I was not there in person to put in the order, it does not mean they could be lazy. Only until I left I realized it was cold in the plastic, really disappointing."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"today i ordered an iced drink but the guy made it a hot drink, another guy took my drink inside for a while and gave it back to me. from the drink appearance i saw i believe they just poured the drink from the hot drinks cup to the iced drinks cup. it is...disgusting. can't you make a new one? But what's more disgusting is i even saw the first guy later picked up an iced drinks cup from the garbage can, peeled the order label and re-sticked it to a hot drinks cup. --BASIC SANITY ISSUE. would never order in here again. store manager please re-train your baristas!!!"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"The folks working here on 30 May Tue 1715hrs esp Danielle were amazing. They went the extra mile to accommodate customers needs and wants, worked in harmony together and just exuded positive vibes all round.  Please do all you can to pat them on their backs as they are deserving of praise. I'm not even from the city but a tourist from Singapore.  Blue skies to the team and hope to see them soon."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Coffee isn't the only thing this chain makes. I've personally never had a better tasting grilled cheese sandwich that is sure to make you rethink your diet. I never have any issues at any of the Starbucks I've visited. Take a second look at the full menu of your nearest location and see if there's anything you've missed out on.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Terrible. Been there three times and they messed up my order three times. This last time they even overcharged me and when I pointed it out the woman at cash register got mad and tried to say it was my fault. I recommend the Pete's Coffee 100 feet down the street.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"I recently visited Starbucks and had an amazing experience! The baristas were friendly, welcoming, and attentive. They were knowledgeable about their coffee and helped me pick out the perfect drink to suit my taste. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the store, and the overall atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The quality of the coffee was exceptional, and my drink was made to perfection. I also appreciated the variety of food options available, which were both tasty and satisfying. The convenience of the mobile ordering and pickup option was a huge plus and made the entire experience hassle-free. Overall, I would highly recommend Starbucks to anyone looking for a high-quality coffee and a great customer experience. Five stars!"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,It’s great like almost every Starbucks. Thank you!
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Underground!! Great service early in the morning when you need that coffee and breakfast! Note that to find this store, you have to take the escalator down from street level towards BART."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"I visited this store earlier and ordered a Venti Frappucino, but I guess the cashier didn't hear me clearly and keyed in a Grande. I just paid blindly and when I was served my order, I was given a Grande. I queried and checked and realised it was my error but the barista offered to make me a Venti as it was what I originally wanted. I didn't take up his offer as it was my own error in not checking but this is truly a 5 star service attitude.  Thanks!"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"BEWARE: They charge customers differently if you're homeless. I witnessed a homeless man ask for a cup of whipped cream and was forced to pay a dollar. Meanwhile, I brought my dog and asked for a cup of whipped cream, and it was given to me FOR FREE with a smile on their faces. It's a shame how dogs are treated better in this city than humans. The morning crew is incredibly rude, especially Stephanie and Rose. They limit waters 2 per customer, and only the tall size. Every other starbucks in San Francisco is happy to give you ANY size water you want. Not sure what that's about. The afternoon crew is always in a rush, focusing more on tasks than the customers. They stop serving fraps nearly an hour before closing and stop brewing fresh coffee 30 minutes before closing. I will never be returning to this location, and I hope you consider boycotting this location too."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"I ordered online, there’s multiple employees whose just chatting and no one asked if I needed help. The guy whom I approached has attitude and just slide my bread instead of handing it out as I was trying to get it on his hand, no thank you just stares at me. The Filipina that works there and the tall Filipino guy gossips a lot. Never coming back here!"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Great location at the bottom of the mall, it's very convenient to grab a coffee right before you get on the train to go to work or the airport"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"I normally don’t have any issues here at this location; however, I am 9 months pregnant and the day this happened I was faint and was feeling suddenly unwell. I needed water and so I had my husband go up and ask for a cup of water and was told that I could only get the smallest sized water despite him ordering a whole other drink. I understand it may be annoying but as a paying costumer refusing a reasonable amount of water (especially to a pregnant women) is nonsense."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,The mall was closed so I couldn't even get in to buy something. They need to fix their hours on their app and on here..
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Decent for grab and go Starbucks. Not a place you’d want to hang out though.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Garbage place with rude staff. Needs better oversight and management
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Yes, it's one of the smallest and busiest Starbucks in San Francisco proper, but the staff always makes it a reason to visit when traveling through Powell Street Muni station.  Once you stop in a few times, you'll feel as welcome as Norm @ Cheers cause they will ""know your name.""  Tell Harold, Christian, Meghan, Leo and Emmanuel hello for me. And make mine a Venti."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,The staff is great! Friendly and they remember your name
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"This Starbucks is great to start any shopping spree you might be going on-- or if it's a weekday morning, with their app- you can get off a mini or Bart train downstairs,  order your drink, and a cake pop- and when you finally get upstairs and to the store- I've almost always had my drink ready for me..."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"One of the few chains that offer reasonably good coffee in the US. Before the Corona pandwmic it was quite a nice experience to buy and drink coffee there.But at this point this is quite a bummer. No sitting spaces anywhere, not even outside the branches. The branches are very poorly lit, which was a nixe touch when you could actually sit an enjoy the coffee inside. But now feels much like a mouse trap... The coffee is still reasonably good but the positive vibe is gone..."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,They had 4 young employees at this store. So only one or two people were making drinks and the other two where just looking busy. It took almost 12 minutes to receive our drinks.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Small but quick. It's Starbucks, you know what to expect."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Been here several times and coffee as always been consistently decent, my only complaint is that I'm standing here at 6:50am and there doors are still closed.  What happened to 6am?"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Shout out of Thanks to an awesome barista ""JOSH"" on this location.  As soon as I walk in to pick up my mobile order, it's ready!  I don't have to ask for it.  He just calls my name!! I am amazed how he remember each of his customers name and faces.  Thank you Josh!! You are doing an excellent job!! Kudos to that!!!"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,The cashier was polite but the mixlogist was rude. Remember customer service. You have customer not the other way around. Do you know how many Starbucks there are in the this city. You don't have room to be rude. Get it together. Treat your money with respect.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"House coffee is good, but the pastries are expensive. I usually get sun dried tomatoes with egg white is pretty good, pricey..Customer service is excellent 👌thank you. …"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"The starbucks here was good although I did not like that I could not pay my .50 cents for my refill. Even if it was just 1/2 hour after, they could not do that in that starbucks, that is the only reason why I give the a 3***. The employees were friendly."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Baristas are super friendly with special attention for Kendall! She has such nice level of customer service. They know how to manage this place even during crowded mornings.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,I love the service at this location they are very fast
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,It's my go to Starbucks in town. They always greet their customers with a smile. The staff was friendly and helpful and my wait time was very short. Wish this location was 24 hours.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Very busy little Starbucks on the lower level of Westfield Center near the BART & MUNI station. We ordered in advance via mobile. and our order was ready about two minutes later, just as we entered. This locale is more of a to-go kind of Starbucks as there is only limited seating."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Thank you for serving me the donut with it's plastic wrap. With that, my to go order could keep the shape, or WHATEVER. The cashier did nothing right! How he could charge incorrect amount, prepare wrong coffee and forget to unwrap the pastry in one transaction?"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"Underground in-between Bart and the mall, this is a tiny Starbucks.  There is always a line but the staff manages to keep up. No seating available inside but aside from that it's a pretty standard Starbucks experience.  For a quick cup of coffee this is still a solid choice."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"They were quick on my in-store order one morning but the next, when I decided to mobile order, they lost the order and I didn't get it until 5 minutes after I complained about the fact it wasn't ready 30 minutes after placing the mobile order"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Going to work I'll take Bart from 16th Street to  Powell Station and I stop by Starbucks because it's right there after I get off of the train but it is maybe me I don't know but it seems like it's out of sync and where you order your drink pay for the drink and then you're standing there you seem like everybody else is getting a drink and someone behind the counter all the way from the register sees you and there's and drink sitting over there by itself and has to come from the register to give you your drink because all the other people that's working back there don't check the names and call them out 🤔 but as I said maybe it's just me but it's happened three or four times so actually I'm going to give this rating a three so to say all of that there's no teamwork back at the store
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"quick through line, a bit noisy machines, snack pack was priced $16, sausage egg sandwich $4.95 and size of two McDonald's, coffee average price"
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"This place is located at the BART station between 5th St & Market St, entrance is in front WestField. Too small, few people working to a lot of customers, line & service are very slow because they should be more guys working. I had ordered 3 items, all of them came out at separate & different time, I didn’t enjoy it at all."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Best iced coffee sometimes they come out with New flavors
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Worst Starbucks I've ever been to I will never go there again every time I've been my drink was made wrong or was warm by the time I got it. I got a vanilla bean Frappuccino that was watered down and melted by the time it got to me. I ask to have it remade and it came out the same. The next time I went I ordered the caramel frappuccino for my niece the person who rang me up asked if I had a milk preference I said it didn't matter as long as it wasn't coconut when my niece took a sip of her Frappuccino she said it tasted funny I said let me see I sniffed it and looked at the drink codes on the cup and the milk box was labeled Co. I asked for the drink to be remade he asked what's wrong with it I said I didn't want coconut milk he said well it's on the cup I said well I didn't ask for coconut milk. He replied by saying well I just made what was on the cup. I said I'm sorry the cup was written incorrectly but I want to drink remade I'm allergic to coconut thank you. He then dumped the drink out in the sink and used the same cup I said you need to switch cups and he ignored me.i then said  if you don't use another cup I will have you remake it. He said just because you asked doesn't mean I will remake it. As soon as I got the cup I tossed it out and he refused to get his manager or remake the drink.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,"I doubt whether THE RACIST is still working in this shop! Two years have been past, I cannot forget the humiliation.  Watch out the racist in this shop!!! When I ordered my coffee, one of the staff(big fat african-american)asked me again as if he didn't understand my word. It's ok. But, when I told my name, he asked me three times, then giggled at me. Then I knew that he was playing with me. Suddenly, he said ""WHAT RACE ARE YOU?"" I couldn't believe... It was impossible he didn't know it. Because one of his coleague was also asian-american. How dare he asked me that rude question. I made some complaint about his rude attitude but I think he will do that racial discriminative behavior again, for sure. I never understand starbucks how such a racist can be hired as a staff... starbucks must have no screening system..."
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,A little loud in the inside so you need to shout your order but great coffee flavors! ☕
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Typical Starbucks coffee shop located in Westfield SF Centre. Small but fairly quick service. Convenient location just off from the muni and BART metro station.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Starbucks is good everywhere. It would make it worse if the staff was rude or anything.  But gratefully I always had great experience... top top top
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Rampant theft and smelly people.  The cashiers serve people who obviously budge in line and then just shrug it off.  Also overcrowded and they keep the big door locked again.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Quick to get out drinks and breakfast food. Super friendly staff also.
Starbucks,865 Market Street San Francisco Centre,Overpriced for the quality. Overcrowded and ill equipped to deal with rushes. I would rather enjoy a local barista like Jamin Java or Le Boulevard.
