Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I love Biscoff biscuits but never heard of coffee so tried their hot chocolate and cream buscuits. Biscuits are costly and nothing special and I think I just paid the price of pier 39. Hot chocolate was good. The order taking guy was just doing his job like robit and easily did wrong with my order.just to mention you will get a sample biscoff biscuit with your order.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"We were having dinner across from this place and the delicious scent of coffee enticed us to save room and come over for dessert after our meal.  Got a glazed donut, plus coffee and hot chocolate. All were very good."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Was getting kind of chilly out on the pier when I spotted this Jen what a delicious cup of coffee I enjoyed every sip recommended if your in pier 39 and don’t get me started on the pastries what a delicious treat.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"This place is a themed coffee station which gives free cookies with every coffee ordered.  I found the predominant colors of red and white as tasteful as the cookies. The cinnamon rolls could have been softer, they seemed stale. The salted caramel coffee was not exactly enticing."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"If you haven’t tried biscoff coffee yet, you are missing out big time. If you have sweet tooth and like biscoff in general, it’s a must try. Tried their Biscoff latte, it was amazing. They do have non-dairy milk option just in case if you don’t take dairy. Add on perk, they give you complimentary biscoff cookie with your coffee 😉"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Had cappucino & Lotus waffle. coffee is regular, nothing special about it. Waffle was 10/10 especially if you like lotus as i do."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I love this cookies ever since I had it at Delta airlines few years back 🤭Coffee was good especially with cookies of course. But the price of the cookies was skyrocket everything was expensive 🤔 2pcs for $2 while I got big bag at the grocery for $3🤭 just saying😆 Of course I will still come back. 👍🏽 Staff was not too friendly 🙃

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,1st time having Biscoff latte at biscoff cafe taste was good. Not very sweet. They had vegan donuts blueberry and Maple. Good variety of cookies.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I like the design and theme of the place. I like how they give out cookies when you order a latte. I like the latte. It was very smooth and soft. I also ordered a biscoff banana smoothie. It tasted like a banana pudding with slight biscoff taste at the end
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"a fun little shop on pier 39 where you can purchase lotus biscoff (including the biscoff crème filled cookies) and coffee drinks. the biscoff latte was pretty nice, albeit not spectacular. i enjoyed getting to purchase a few biscuits as i have been missing them since leaving europe. if you’re into the lotus biscuits or need a quick coffee fix, this is your spot."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Quick service, tasty lattes, and they give you a free cookie with every order. Pricing is on par with the rest of the coffee in the area."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,This place is definitely a treat to visit if your into Biscoff and their products. We walked away with a smoothie and latte that were flavorful. They also have coffee beans which we had to buy. All together interesting store
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"My favorite cafe in the pier. Can’t have enough of the biscoff latte. Every time I go to the pier, I grab a cup of the latte and go sit watch the ocean. Very rich, creamy and tasty"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"If you want to have a drink that taste like Biscoff, this is the place to do it (pun intended)"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Great place to grab a quick coffee. The cafe is wheelchair accessible and is very much consumer oriented. Wait time was nearly 5 minutes and the coffee & snacks here are budget friendly as well. The coffee I ordered was delicious and came with a biscotti too. 😋 One can add milk & sugar according to their preference right next to the counter once after the coffee is handed over. They had various types of milk available here! The staff here was helpful and courteous. Thanks!
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"I visited this store during my trip to the pier sometime back. I picked up a Hot Chocolate and a family pack of Biscoff cookies with Belgian chocolate. The Hot Chocolate was good, and it kept me warm when the cold winds were blowing at the end of the pier. I'm a fan of the caramelized crunchy Biscoff cookies. After tasting the ones with Belgian chocolate, I love Biscoff even more. The family pack had seven 3-pack. I relished every one of it. I wish I got Biscoff cookies in my city! Their staff was polite during my visit, and the checkout was quick. Biscoff Coffee Corner is a great spot to pick up a hot beverage and enjoy some delicious cookies while you're at the pier."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,They serve good sections of drinks at fairly average price and portion.  Tidy place and overall quick service.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"magai chinamu mate, this biscoff latte was the highlight of SF.  be sure to get one of these when you stop by"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Afternoon iced coffee locale.  I liked it.  I also liked the mini Biscoff cookie that came with it.  Nice touch.  I got a croissant which was just okay.  I did not think it had a lot to offer for flavor. The guys got donuts and they said they were just okay, too.  The shop has cookies for sale and cookie butter (it looks similar to peanut butter).  Good place to get a present for Biscoff lovers!"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I ordered an iced coffee and I was not offered any creamer or milk. Told the staff in English AND in Spanish that I wanted lactose free milk since I wasn't asked how I wanted the coffee. They didn't understand in either language. No wonder minimum wage still exists.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,The cookies are the exact same as the ones you can get for free on airplanes. And i love them. Though you can buy them cheaper elsewhere. just a heads up.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I wish there was more of these shops around to visit. Absolutely love their coffee. Do you mail out your beans overseas?
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Good vibe! It reminds my mother. When I was young she loves to eat this cookies with coffee..

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I got the iced salted carmel and my love got the ice biscoff
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,We just found a bee in my daughters drink and she is allergic to bees! Your carelessness could have caused her to lose her life

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Coffee was good.  Small coffee was $3.60US! Complimentary mini cookie with purchase.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Tried this place for the first time. Coffee was really good. Strong and bold coffee. It didn't taste acidic like a lot of coffee does. We didn't even have to add an extra shot of espresso like you do with star bucks. We ordered the salted carmel Latta. Great coffee great service, would highly recommend this place."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Coffee was good comes with free Biscoff cookie. Hot chocolate was over sweet.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Worst coffee experience. The cashier couldn’t or wouldn’t understand. We ended up waiting almost 20 mins before a troll of a manager gruffly growls if we have a question. Horrible man who should not be working there, let alone a manager. We did not ask for free coffee. We only wanted to be treated as customers"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Worst coffee I ever had. Ordered the cold brew and it wasn’t even cold. It’s normal, day-old, sour and stale coffee that they pour over ice. 0/10 do not come here if you enjoy black coffee."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Coffee was excellent, not more I  am say except go try, the smoothies will blow your socks off 🤯 …"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Great place if you’re in the area and need a coffee. I wouldn’t go out of my way though. They did give each coffee a Biscoff biscuit which was a nice touch.

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Great coffee!
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Vegan Biscoff Latte!  If you choose one of their plant based milks (almond, oat, or soy) and ask for no whip cream it is vegan 😋 they mix in a generous amount of Biscoff cookie butter in it. Also, free cookie with every coffee order. A small was enough to get my heart racing and sugar fix in 😜"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"I got to know the bus off at Alaska airlines and scouted towards the store at pier 39. But, didn’t satisfied with the taste of coffee and biscut size .  Not a worth to go is what I feel"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Of Alllllll my years in S.F. visiting the piers this is my first time here. I had a almond pumpkin spice latte over ice 🧊 ☕ 🎃 and it was decent. Was not as sweet as Starbees but it did what it needed to do (wake me up). They gave me a complimentary ""Biscoff"" cookie that everyone in my group was raving about. So I tried it out & it tasted like a cinnamon gramcracker. I guess you dip it in hot coffee or that was what it's ment for. I can see how that pairs together. Prices are generally the same as other coffee houses. All thought they were busy from tourists They were on point with their customer service & help. I definitely didn't have to wait long for my order."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Good coffee and other treats to eat. The staff is also great and helpful.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,A Biscoff coffee with the famous Biscoff cookie. What else do you need? My first stop whenever I hit the pier.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Oh my gosh the Biscoff latte is one of my favorite things I've ever had. Tastes like a Biscoff cookie, which is slightly similar to a ginger snap."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"the famous biscoff, it's almost a world of biscoff at this place. The place is very lit and vibrant. I had a cup of coffee with free biscoff!"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,The coffee was good..the woman taking orders wasn't friendly. Not impressed by her behavior. The guy making the coffee was quick..carrot cake bar was good but husband said he has tasted better. The free cookie was tiny. Will probably not return. Just read the other reviews and the cashier is rude. Why let someone run this place?
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"I LOVE BISCOFF AND I LOVE COFFEE, SO I LOVED THIS PLACE!!!"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Coffee was nice but the person (the one wearing a mask) working at the coffee cart a couple of feet away, was not very friendly. Was rather rude actually."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Classic Biscoff biscuits. Service is very nice. A must visit in Pier 39 if you really enjoy the biscuits!
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Tried here since the store was fairly busy. Their latte did not disappoint at all
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"They had a blueberry vegan doughnut which was exciting in a touristy area without a lot of vegan options, service was fast and they were able to quickly get through customers despite limited space inside."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Biscoff hits my nostalgia. I grew up eating the biscuits that has yum, sugar grainy taste.  This was the first time I visited the coffee shop owned by this company. I ordered Hot Chocolate and biscuits to go with it (obviously)  Hot chocolate was warm and thick. Also just the right amount of sweet.. This coffee shop is located in the pier 39 which is beautifully lit in the evenings. So if you're ever in the area, good place to grab some cookies and beverage for the road."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Super yummy pastries and great smoothie! Can’t have caffeine so didn’t try the coffee but it smelt amazing ☕️ 🧋🥐 …
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"I went there back in June. The coffee was okay but the cookie was delicious. Although, the cashier lady was rude to my mom and I. We asked her about the flavors for the latte and she got annoyed and told us with an attitude."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,It was a hot day and I went in since it said fresh juice outside. Apparently they only had the usual packaged juices. They also carry smoothies.  They forgot to prepare our order. After standing there for a while they asked us what we ordered and then went to make our drink.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I was so happy to find somewhere that had vegan stuff. Even if it was only donuts. They were lovely and the staff were friendly. It's in a great location
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Delish! I had a hot white mocha which was really good. (Im an avid Starbucks drinker so I'm comparing the two I suppose) The coffee they were brewing smelled just like their cookies tasted. Must have been really yummy.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"I didn’t know my favorite cookie had a coffee corner! This was a wonderful surprise. However, this five is for the customer service! The worker was incredibly knowledge, patient and helpful. Definitely exceeded expectations."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Great place, quick service. A coffee place that also has biscoff cookies what else could you ask for?  Try the biscoff latte!"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"First time visiting there in my many times visiting S.F.  The lady this evening was very nice,  Sorry didn't catch her name.  Coffee very good, cookies wonderful.  I buy the cookies all the time anyway but never have I noticed there little store.  I will definitely visit again next time I visit S. F. Which is normally the twice a year."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,What a wonderful match - coffee and biscuit!
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Dip the Biscoff Cracker into your coffee from Biscoff. Super 🔥 …
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,My absolute favorite place!! Everything tastes amazing from the cookies to their smoothies! 🙌🏼 …
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"The biscuits here taste really good. Biscoff started off as a biscuit provider for airlines in the united kingdoms and it gained international popularity, subsequently they expanded.  The plain biscuits were already good enough, if you're passing by you should definitely drop by and get some."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"The service was not good at all. We were waiting for five coffees and it took her so long to prepare it. I could see her doing something else than doing our order. After she put it out on the counter, we took it since we knew it was ours. She then looked at me harshly saying ""it wasn't okay"". My boyfriend asked her why it wasn't okay, and she denied what she said. He told her off and we left. The coffee was normal. A bit too sweet for a latte. And the lotus cookie was nothing special as well."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Coffee is ok.  Not at the same level as an independent coffee shop.  WiFi is painfully slow.  Also no seating of any kind.  Had to sit at the business next door.  Shop could be greatly improved if they could add some outdoor seating and a better wifi router. Aside from that, coffee prices are very fair.  So no complaints there."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Great coffee, great pastries.  Its everything you could want while walking around Pier 39 on a breezy morning in San Francisco."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,We actually has a complimentary biscoff at the local restaurant. It just hit the spot after eating out meal.  Since we loved them so much we purchased a packet to go...the do sell single cookies if your not sure if its something you may like.  The have other baked sweets and a vegan bluberry donut...many choices great quick service.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Their mocha made me puke .. pathetic place
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Great coffee and love the cookies, they are the best.  We had super friendly service here and the location is the best.  Grabbed our coffee and cookies and sat on a nearby bench to enjoy the terrific sunshine.  Price was reasonable too!  🍪☕️😊 …"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"It was my first time going there and it was really good. I thought it was really cute that you got a little biscoff cookie with everything that you order, even if I decided to give mine back. I didn't get a very hard drink to make but my boyfriend's drink was just as good and was a bit more complicated than it my nornal coffee."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,The biscoff latte is the best flavored coffee I've ever had;
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Showed up at 8am 5/14 (hours online said they opened at 8) and was given the stank eye through the window. The worker told me 10 more minutes and wasn’t happy about me being there. More like Bi***off.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Espresso tasted a little burnt to me, but decent otherwise. Free cookie is a nice touch. Service was a little slow, but they were busy which is not their fault."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"I tried this coffee shop for the first time.  I ordered the cafe latte, and my companion ordered a regular coffee, which he thought had a strange coconut flavor.  My latte was average.  The complimentary cookie was way too sweet."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"It's situated admist busy pier 39. It has easy walk-in and walk-out. You need to order the coffee and then stand outside the shop, near the counter until your order is ready and served at the counter. They serve the coffee with a small biscoff cookie, absolutely complimentary. Their menu so provide range of house coffees which is DIY. The place is small, hardly any place to sit. It's take away coffee. The taste is strong and awesome."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Get the biscott drip!!!! Let’s look passed the most amazing cookie butter that you will ever have, you can buy that anywhere around the US, but if you want a bomb diggity coffee then get the drip. The Staff was so happy to help! My crew asked some basic questions that was embarrassing and then some (like when where the beans roasted) and the staff had the information in point!!!"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Excellent coffee, quick and friendly service, and a Biscoff to go with it.  I really don't know what more you could want.....but if there is something, this place probably sells it too.  They were great!"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I’ve been here since March and seems like every time I go anywhere on Pier 39 including this store someone complains about me and the security officers come. I don’t even know what I said with the exception of “may I have a bag please” and leaving the store 🤦🏾 thank God they’re sold at Walgreens 🙏🏾 …
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Best maple donut and coffee !!
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Hot chocolate is the thick kind. There were also fabric hairs underneath my cover. Customer service wasn't great. It's an alright place overall

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Need to have more oatmeal maple scones usually sold out by afternoon.  Protein power bar is my daily go to with large coffee.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"A great alternative to Starbucks. Delicious, pure coffee at a reasonable price. I got a Chai Latte from there that was perfectly balanced. It was not too sweet, not too bitter. It was overall, pretty much as perfect as a cup of coffee can be."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Long wait, Coffee tasted burnt"
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,I got a blended drink that was amazing! You also get a biscuit cookie with every drink! The cardboard straws made it hard to drink once it started to soften but the drink was well worth that!!
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Rude cashier I asked her for a light roast coffee and gave me dark roast . I asked her politely to give me light roast. She got mad and went crazy! Unprofessional staff and the coffee was not good

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Vanilla latte was pretty bad. Even worse, the lady wasn't purging the steam wand in-between drinks meaning it was very unsanitary."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Who doesn't love Lotus cookies with coffee? Nice flagship store
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Open early...I don't drink coffee, so they have a nice small selection of donuts, bagels, and croissants (plain and chocolate).  It's convenient if you are going whale watching."

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Had a wonderful latte there. But they have interesting shakes/ smoothies.. realized later.. will definitely try next time.
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Just don't go there.  I know that Biscoff is delicious but as delicious as you may think things injected with biscoff will be? They aren't. They're really sickly and overpriced and a waste of time.  That being said, if you want to buy overpriced Biscoff merchandise then it is the place to go."

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,The hot chocolate taste like warm milk&spice apple cider is watered down . Came close to closing time went back for a sugar & some girl with a tattoo on her arm was really rude about giving me sugar and a stir stick for my grandma's coffee.

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,Very wide choice of Viennese pastries for sweet tooth like me with a lot of choice of drinks also of very good quality.

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Ok you're at Pier 39 but the prices for a coffee and a croissant are exaggerated, among other things the croissant tasted like nothing."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"We ordered some hot chocolates and donuts. Delicious everything, it took very little to serve us everything. I recommend it"

Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,All the drinks and sweets are delicious
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Very unfriendly. I ordered a coffee and waited a long time, but nothing was served. The barista, who was making coffee for my next customer, said, 'Have you placed your order?' After asking, he gave me a cup and told me to pour myself a cup of coffee. The cashier didn't give me any guidance while I was waiting because I didn't know the store system. They didn't pay any attention to me and just joked among themselves. I honestly don't want to give even one star for this unfriendly place with no consideration for first-time guests."
Biscoff Coffee Corner,213 Pier 39,"Very nice and good coffee, I love the cookies from the place along with the coffee and the service is fast. So far I have nothing bad to say."
