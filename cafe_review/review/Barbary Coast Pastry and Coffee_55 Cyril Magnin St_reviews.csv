Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Not bad. Got a decent cafe late and a huge croissant for $10 two mornings in a row as I was staying at Parc55.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Amazing coffee and location. Nice counters to watch city move by in a clean and cozy atmosphere. The croissant breakfast sandwiches ARE AMAZING. Been going daily while at a conference.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"I read some bad reviews before coming here and I was quite surprised because I really like this place.  The staff is friendly and it's fun to have breakfast while seeing all kinds of people walk by. Furthermore, the doughnuts are delicious! I highly recommend the old-fashioned doughnut!!!🤤"
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"just got a coffee. it was nice, hot and strong. very good flavor. just two other people were inside, but there's seating which I think is great. It is clean and has good music playing. would come back again!"
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Disappointing! If you are staying at Parc 55 Hotel, don’t get breakfast here! Rather walk across the street and get a sandwich from Daniel’s cafe! At Daniel’s the sandwiches come with real eggs, cooked on the spot, unlike here, where my ham, egg and cheese bagel had a “fake-tasting” egg patty. I specified twice for my bagel to be toasted twice, was assured it will be, but nope 👎 They could do better!"
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"You can get good coffee here with good price. Compare to Starbucks and other brands, it’s about half price here of an Americano. And there are many kind of snacks and bread. The store is the best choice for those who wants a budget price."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"This small little cafe finally open again after it closed down during Pandemic. I am not sure if they have changed owner. It used to be run by either Koreans or Chinese family. But now I don't see them. They freshly made your croissant with ham, egg, cheese, etc. However, the price has increased since the last time I bought the same croissant here."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Great place for breakfast! Clean and friendly. Prices are good!! $$ Perfect location for us staying at Parc 55.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Food is great, prices are fair, and the service is quick.  I'm very pleased."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Good place to visit and chill ^^ Donuts and sandwiches are really delicious, you should come and try it."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Soft and fluffy donuts! Comforting house coffee, and I really enjoyed the croissant sandwiches and bagels. Yum! Will be back!"
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Small but excellent quality food and drinks are well done.  Fast and great service.  Brought our family here and kids got awesome doughnuts and we got an equally excellent breakfast sandwiches.  The lattes were far superior to Starbucks.  Would absolutely come back again.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"My go to place for coffee, pastries, and great sandwiches! My only complaint is that the mentally ill also love the place(😁) so there is almost always some craziness to deal with while you're just trying to have breakfast and read the morning paper, but beyond that....one of my favorite spots. Oh yea, window sitting and people watching is a must here!"
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Small donut shop right off of Powell BART. The staff were fast and friendly and the donuts were delicious. They also have tasty breakfast sandwiches, so it's a good spot to grab some breakfast or office donuts. A dozen donuts are $15, and the breakfast sandwiches are fresh."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Surprisingly amazingly soft and fluffy donuts! Not greasy at all. Coffee was delicious, no free refills though. Breakfast sandwich was really good, croissant was flakey and buttery goodness!"
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Some of the best (classic) doughnuts in SF,  decent mass-batch drip coffee (Peerless, a local roaster out of Oakland) and efficient service. The ladies behind the counter are not going to coddle you or welcome you with a big Midwestern-style smile when you walk in, they’re there to get you served and out the door as their main clientele = business travelers and commuters.  Unsurprisingly, if you’re hemming and hawing on your choice when there’s a large queue don’t be shocked if you get a sideways glance or they skip to the next person in line while you figure out your order. That being said, this place is an absolute gem when it comes to classic doughnuts as they have some of the fluffiest, pillowy-yeasty raised doughnuts in the city and their old fashioned and apple fritters are top notch as well.  As someone who LOVES doughnuts but hates grease-bombs I really appreciate having ones which were fried properly and don’t leave your fingers slicked with grease post-indulgence. Since Blue Star hasn’t hit NorCal yet and Lamar’s is still out in Colorado, this spot has become my top pick for classics done right.  PS- If you  want a fancy/ bespoke coffee, they will make you specialty coffee drinks (think flavored syrups, candy names, etc.) , but that’s not their forte. Stick to the classic options and you’ll be in good hands."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Spent three weeks in Paris and tried every croissant I could find. This place makes ones easily as good as the best I had in Paris and was a quiet retreat in a very busy place. Highly recommended!
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Amazing croissants! Very surprised by how good they were.  Friendly staff and clean place.  Busy little place, but half the seats face out the big windows."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Super fantastic service, good place for a snack, and the best blended drinks (sweet bliss blended coffee and rise and shine smoothie) that we've ever had. It was a great start to our morning."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,All I can say is that there's a reason why there's a line out the door in the mornings.  The breakfast pastrys and sandwiches are great.  I'm glad our hotel is right around the corner from this place.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,They have everything to get you through the morning. Also a great place to watch people walking around. It is near a subway station and in a good location from several hotels. Be careful of the $5 minimum.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"If you're staying at the Parc 55, consider this place for breakfast. It will save you around $30! The service is a little slow, but the food is good."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"Worker was kind of rude, and does not understand the difference between 'turkey bacon' sandwich and 'turkey AND bacon' sandwich. Much better service at Daniels Cafe around the block."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Delicious bagel egg cheese sandwich & coffee. Nice staff. Quick in and out. Nice view from the window seat.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"The people we're nice, good ppl watching location and great fresh bakery selection.. but the coffee was  dead awful. I could hardly stomach it"

Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,There just isn't any love for what they are providing.  The food is actually good but I feel like I'm just another person in there monotonous life that pays them.
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,The avocado toast was not even salted and tasted like nothing and one of the staff members (owner?) was not friendly at all.

Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"The place doesn't seem very welcoming to me... also the quality of the food could be improved, as well as the seats: they are few and rather uncomfortable. However, for a quick meal, it's not that bad."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,"It is excellent for breakfast. They have espresso!! There is a wide choice of sweet and savoury. The croassaints are very good and there are different fillings. They also have toasted sandwiches, beagles and sandwiches. Perfect for anyone staying at parc 55."
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,The donuts are super delicious coffee is average
Barbary Coast Pastry and Coffee,55 Cyril Magnin St,Run by fast Chinese girls: if you are staying at Parc 55 it is a valid alternative to the hotel breakfast. With a few dollars you can eat instead of spending 30 in the hotel!
