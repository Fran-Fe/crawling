Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"An amazing local coffee shop with a diverse variety of assorted merchandise to purchase. Not really a place to chill inside but you feel so much at home with the welcoming staff. The moment you enter the shop, there is a warm welcoming effect with a sense of belonging. The selection is solid to choose for your delight and the drinks are on point. There might not be room indoors but there is a local garden with plenty of space and some tables and chairs outside for a quick gathering with a friend or two. Check this place out if you're local."
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,On the road and want to get some coffee and find this. Cute local handmade art crafts shop that also selling coffee and pastry. Some special coffee favors that I would like to try next time.
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"Your place is amazing and the first small business that has a compost for the customers. I was so happy to see that. It's unfortunate that the customers do not spare a minute to separate their trash.  I gave you a 4 star only because you all are still supporting single use waste. I understand the customers want take aways but this is where America as a society must change. People must learn to pause and sit down and have their beverages or meals. If they want a take away, people must bring their containers. I understand as a business it is hard to make money when customers do not want to make an effort. But putting a sign outside promoting bringing your own cup would help. People know single use waste is an issue but do not want to bring the discipline. The sign might be the spark in their mind. Hope you are able to help educate the customers! I will swing by again sometime when I am back in town. Best wishes to your business! Ciao!"
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"A real community hub.  Delicious coffees and pastries.  Local artists goods for sale.  Community spirit!  Get it to enjoy at tables outside or take it to go.  Enjoy, support, be part of community.  Family friendly."
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"I wanted to come to this place for a long time and I finally had the opportunity. The place is very nice filled with random things to buy. I love that most of the thing are local so this is a local business supporting other local small/business. The menu is is great and you can find different options for drinks and pastries. I had an iced lavender latte and it was delicious I also had a pastry but forgot the name of it. Everything was great from the service to the price and quality , I 100% recommend people to come here. For sure I will!!!!"
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"Their reputation precedes them, and for good reason!! The iced Coconut Ube latte with oat milk is 5 stars for sure. Also the gluten-free peanut butter cookie! Normally gluten free is bad but this one was made by the Gods."
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,Very good & great customer service! I had an iced oatmilk lavender latte & their vegan blueberry muffin. Good stuff
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"Wonderful, quaint little neighborhood coffee shop!  Coffee (mocha) is consistently good: hot and the right balance of bitterness and chocolate sweetness.  The entire staff is really nice people.  So warm, friendly, caring and welcoming.  They have lots of coffee and tea options and also some yummy pastries.  They also sell some pretty cool community focused goods and souvenirs.  Not only that, they care about the community, actively sponsoring and participating in neighborhood events and looking out for the well-being of the neighborhood and its residents.  We are so lucky to have them here!  One thing to note is that they don't have seating inside, only limited seating outside."
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"There is something intimate and warm about this place, we loved having our breakfast here( jam and cheese croissants and our coffee) Charming"
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"Amazing lavender latte. Great coffee itself, not bitter and had great robustness but delicate at the same time. The lavender was not too strong either nor was it too sweet. My perfect type of treat coffee. The owners and service was so kind and genuine. They really made the experience lovely. Art and interior also peaked my interest with all the local works."
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,Really super cute place with a great atmosphere. Lots of boutique items to look at while you wait for your coffee. Using St Frank's coffee which is a winter always.

Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,Adorable local coffee shop serving legit coffee.

The owner Kelly is super sweet - she told us she trained with the St. Frank guy and it shows!  The shop also sells cute gifts from local artisans.

The owner is really kind and friendly as well and hosts community events like pop ups across the street. Will definitely come back for more!"
Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,"We got recommended an iced caramel latte with whipped cream and caramel drizzle and it was one of the best coffees I ever tried! We came to SF for a quick 3 day trip and 2 out of those 3 days we had to come back, the service was 10/10 as well as the food!"

Mission Blue,144 Leland Ave,Stumbled on this treasure of a coffee shop/gift shop yesterday while walking San Francisco's Crosstown Trail. What a win for this neighborhood!

Highly recommend to visit this place!"

The ""Thai iced coffee"" is more inspired than it is direct (actually Thai iced coffee will give you a sugar coma) but it was still delicious. Come here for coffee if you can!"
