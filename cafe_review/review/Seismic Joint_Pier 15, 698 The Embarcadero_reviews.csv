Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Over priced. Counter service, limited seating in shared Exploratorium space. It's basically higher quality fast food. I paid $17 in total for a small pasta. I added protein for $5 which turned out to be two small shrimps. Womp womp..."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Too over priced food was just alright and service was slow would not recommend to a local in the area.👍
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","They are open Tuesday- Sunday form 10am-5pm. They serve hot food tue-fri from 11am-3pm. Have this delicious horchata latte, which I totally recommend. Although the prices may be a tad bit expensive, its pretty delicious, and next door you have the great Exploratorium museum. So when you're tired from exploring in there you can always stop by for a quick bite. I hope this helps ."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Selling a cup of water at $5 is disgusting. Shame on you. Cup probably cost .25 or less and would have been fine paying for the cup. Greedy. Food also is terrible.
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Kicked out 10 minutes before closing, even with a sleeping baby, as we waited for family to exit the Exploratorium. The young chap even made as much noise as possible to try to wake up the baby. All class. “Closes at 5pm” lol"
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","The food is decent, but TOO expensive for essentially ordering fast food to-go. There are very few choices on the menu or in the Exploratorium. There's a lot to see in the Exploratorium, so you don't exactly have time to eat elsewhere for lunch. There's also very limited seating."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Critical health code violation: I've seen an employee using a restroom, NOT washing his hands and immediately starting to work at the restaurant preparing food ! I complained to the manager, but she dismissed my complaint.  Think twice if you want to eat at such a place!"
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Avoid Avoid AVOID! Soooo expensive and such shoddy quality. Yes I know it's a museum cafe but do anything else, I'm telling you - pack a lunch, walk 10 min to the Ferry Building, take a bus down the Embarcadero, hitchhike to McDonalds, just don't eat here."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",I dined in and the sun was nice and bright perfect for the summer time the server gave me my drinks fast
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Pretty good pulled chicken, grilled cheese, and OK falafel. Faster than the restaurant at the Exploratorium, but similarly over priced."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","The coffee is good, they have a shakerato drink, espresso shaken over ice with orange zest, refreshing twist on morning caffeine."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Waste of money. Too pricey for so called unhealthy food and obnoxious staff. So many places to eat arnd...just walk!
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Way overpriced.  $9 for a plain hot dog.  Very limited fruit/veggi options.
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","You must be dumb to price fries at 5.50 and milk shakes at EIGHT ,avoid this the burgers are meh and bland,just go to in n out and the fries are so dry"
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Super duper nice people and the food is yummy 😋😋 …
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Rude staff, overpriced junk food. The only reason it's open at all is the lack of alternatives. Avoid."
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Very good customer service and food🍔👍 …
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Not good. Very over priced.... Don't bother unless your starving.
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero",Ok dinner food to go at tourist prices.
Seismic Joint,"Pier 15, 698 The Embarcadero","Absolutely overpriced. A macchiato is just a tiny shot, so $4 is a joke. Scones are dry. So back to Starbucks."
