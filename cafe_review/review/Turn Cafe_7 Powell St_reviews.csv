Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,A surprisingly good spot for breakfast. They have very nice pastries and coffee drinks. And they will also cook up a variety of breakfast meals for you.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Very overpriced, but they have an area open to anyone with very comfortable seating. We had 3 hours to kill before we had to catch a bus home so we waited here and used the free wifi, and charging stations. The bathroom is downstairs and you have to ask the cafe employees for the key."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Pinky and Christine are phenomenal bar tenders! They are charming and witty and deliver seamless service with the added bonus of the elegance of the building. Also Sephora is next door and is great to pitstop in for drinks. The happy hour menu is decent and they have mimosas in the morning. The Turnt chicken is so good. Go see the gals and treat them right. They're damn fine company
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"I liked the chai latte, but everything else was awful. Very overpriced. Lasagna was the size of my palm and burger ordered medium came out burnt. Two stars for latte."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Horrible coffee in the morning. Why don't americans not know how to foam the milk with an espresso machine without feeling like it was made on the surface of the sun.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Very nice atmosphere with a wonderful staff. However, many of the menu items here are way overpriced, especially the beverages."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Should have read the actual reviews! Service is just horrible and fun is about the same! Dry toast, confused when people come in ?  How strange... took over an hour to get the worst omelette and crunchy toast."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Got the oolong milk tea and the egg puff waffle. Person at the counter was very helpful.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Nice rest stop near a tourist hotspot. Always loved the food here and they have decent alcohol too. Fun, funky seating with free WiFi and lots of places to charge your devices"
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Great place! Very friendly staff. They have options to go or eat in. Would recommend if you are waiting for the cable car. Great place to grab a bit and stand in line. We got food from here twice during our stay in San Francisco. There are gluten free baked good options.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Very nice bar tender and good Bloody Mary, only USD 6 between 9 and 11 am"
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Save your money and go somewhere else. Breakfast was extremely expensive for basic plain breakfast that wasn't very good. Waitress doesn't come back after giving you your food since you pay when you order. Seating is extremely limited, most spots aren't big enough to eat at. Coffee was alright, but definitely very over priced here. You could walk another block to Cafe Bellini and have a much better meal for a lower price."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"You might be surprised when you walk into this place because it doesn't look like much more than a hotel bar but it did not disappoint at all. We ordered 2 brunch plates and the food was outstanding. Seating is a bit limited, just fyi, but the place wasn't busy so we had no issues."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"This place is pure garbage! Rude staff, uninterested in any level of customer service. Received the most garbage bagel breakfast sandwich with some rubberized processed egg thing. Nasty and inedible had to turn it into an 11 dollar avocado bagel.  The coffee was decent but that is what makes them deserve the one ⭐️"
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"Bartender condescendingly informed me the drink I wanted was not a happy hour special and handed me the happy hour menu even though I had already set that one down in full view. This is extremely insulting and I expect better service, especially in this area where tourism is in abundance. Yes I am wearing jeans and a hooded sweatshirt. Yes I look very young ( I am not) there are however better ways to handle this. If he is incapable then perhaps he should not work in customer service. I tipped a dollar . I generally would have tipped nothing but the drink was food."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"While the ""famous^ Axiom burger was indeed good and huge, the fact that it took them 30 minutes to serve it made them a star lower in my books. We came here for a quick drink and eats before catching a show at the theater. The quick didn't happen. I wanted to try their other drinks but I got so disheartened that we stuck with our one drink each. On the upside, they have a pretty good happy hour selection and the lounge area was nice and quiet."
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Love it! Great service and incredible food. The chef does it right with the mushroom and avocado Crostini's! Gabor is the best bartender. The Axiom and 1944 are the best drinks. Large screen TV's upstairs with all the sports games. Classic arcade games and a foosball table. Enough said great place.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Walked in to two hostesses at the stand not doing anything. One said she'll be right with you and the other said one minute and picked up the phone. The hostess that was free went around picking up and doing nothing and no one sat us. After about 10 minutes we left without being acknowledged or seated.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Great happy hour prices on drinks and oysters all day. The hamburger was excellent and shishito peppers weren't bad. All in all a great way to starr Friday evening
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Went with a friend for their happy hour. Waited 20 mins at a dirty table and the staff never came to clean the table or take our order. Not impressed by the customer service at all. Maybe this place is under staffed?!

Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,breakfast and brunch
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,"I loved the place and the attention. Also, the prices are reasonable and you don't feel like you're being robbed for having breakfast. It should be noted that the coffee is ground instantly, so the American coffee is not smooth or as watery as in other places. And this is because they grind the coffee when you order. I would also like to recommend you order the chocolate muffin as a friend tried it and said it was excellent"
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,Varied and tastefully prepared breakfast. Excellent espresso. Quite expensive.
Turn Cafe,7 Powell St,The only upside was that it was virtually deserted when we stopped by.
