Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,My favorite Blue Bottle location in the city as they closed down the Mint Plaza site. Great for people watching and they now have WiFI. Well crafted coffees and baked goods.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Packed house, but the staff is very efficient. Most ppl get coffee to go, so seating is available if you want to chill out.  The coffee and food is amazing also, but most ppl already know this about blue bottle."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Nice to have two locations quite close to each other. They both get around the same amount of foot traffic. Coffee standard is top tier regardless of location though!
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"The perfect place when you want to treat yourself to perfect coffee with ambiance. This location - in a grand historic building fits the bill awesomely.  When traveling to the US, after lots of trial-and-error, I have honed in on Blue Bottle Coffee. And their coffee never ever disappoints.  I generally order their flat-white with whole milk. Two ristretto shots blended in masterfully with perfectly microfoamed milk to give you a luxurious, velvety texture to go with the awesome taste.  Great place to start your day right."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Visiting from out of town for work, this was the closest shop to the office. My group ordered 4 drinks, mine was an iced cafe mocha. Not only did the other 3 drinks come out 30 minutes before mine - I was asked what kind of milk and responded “1% please”… After waiting so long for this drink, I happened to watch the barista make it with like 2 cups of 2% and top it off with whatever was left in the 1%. This probably sounds picky but I honestly wouldn’t have made a fuss if I hadn’t waited so long just for them to not make it correctly lol. Maybe it’s because I’m from out of town, but next time I’ll just go to Starbucks."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Fun. I had the pleasure of trying Blue Bottle Coffee for the first time and it definitely won't be the 💙last! This coffee was outstanding - smooth, rich and full of flavor. The beans were expertly-roasted and you could really taste the care and effort that went into making them. The baristas were friendly and knowledgeable and made ordering an easy and enjoyable experience. Yes I had a wonderful 😀experience and will definitely be returning for more of this exceptional 🔥coffee. Highly recommended!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Probably my favorite Blue Bottle cafe in San Francisco. Awesome space, great coffee and dental location."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Swung by for a latte in the midst of the typical morning rush, so understandably had to wait a bit for my order.  Store front is pretty cute, with what I’d say is more than average in terms of amount of seating in a coffee shop in San Francisco."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue bottle is fine. It's better than Starbucks, but not on the level of smaller roasters in the area."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Nice coffee, great cookies and super hot cocoa!!! The staff is friendly, the open design of the cafe is really nice and plenty of seating. Can get loud as it is next to a pub inside this building."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Awesome location, in the financial district but a bit off to the side of Market St. so not very busy at all (at least it wasn’t busy on Saturday afternoon). It’s a very large, clean location with clean streets outside too. The coffee was absolutely delicious. Only downside is there is no wifi. My verizon hotspot worked decently enough though."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Amazing coffee, location, aesthetic, and the staff is super helpful and kind."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This is the most beautiful Blue Bottle Coffee in the financial district. However, it can get very busy during certain hours, and you’ll be waiting more than 20 minutes to get your coffee. Don’t fret! Use the app when you are in a rush and your coffee is ready when you arrive. They often have seasonal drinks and top notch espresso and quality matcha source from Stonemill Matcha (the popular matcha cafe in the Mission). Seating is minimal since it is so popular and this is one of the few cafe with wifi. Truly a rare gem in this city. Another plus is the clean restroom in the builiding."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Before my trip to San Francisco for a short stay I asked my regular Australian coffee barista where to go for good coffee. He recommended Blue Bottle Coffee. He was right. Great espresso coffee, friendly staff and a buzzing atmosphere made for a great experience. Special thanks to Issac for the warm welcome."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Had a decaf coffee the night before and decided to try its more popular coffee the next day. Hence, avocado toast and New Orleans iced coffee at 630 in a 10 degrees morning. Avocado toast was not too filling, and it tasted like the avocados was flavored with either lemon or lime juice, pepper, and as you can see with tons of paprika too. I really like the New Orleans as well. Service was also good and friendly! Be prepared for a little queue if you're heading down later in the day though. Also, the kitchen closes around 1530 so head down before if you have intentions to try their food!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Amazing coffee which is obviously a given! I tried to work from blue bottle and had a tough experience. For starters there’s no outlets but mort importantly it’s extremely loud. i wasn’t able to hear my calls. Great coffee shop to hang or chat with someone but not work.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"this space is great. the service is bad. Unattentive staff, totally focused on cleaning the grill forever, didn't even notice there was a line for 10min."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Coffee was good, waffle was fresh and crispy (they cook it here) , interior was clean, open and modern cashier seemed sad, Barista smiled when I talked to her. They were playing happy Disney music my daughter liked."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Amazing place, amazing coffee and tee ! Pastries and waffle are also qualitative ! I recommend this place ! Barista are really nice there !"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle outlet delivering the exceptional quality and consistency that the brand is known for. The spot where this branch is located is surrounded by offices, and as such not super charming - but it is what it is. Expect a line, but things move along reasonably speedily."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very good coffees! You even get a glass of sparkling water next to your espresso.  My normal espresso was a bit more sour and bitter than the average coffee. Not sure whether it was the blend or how it was made.  Gorgeous place, relaxed to sit down. Not too many people on laptops.  Enough space for our little one to play on the ground"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"It’s a franchise, but this blue bottle is in a great location near FiDi and Market Street. It’s a little pricier than Starbucks but the hot coffee is made individually. They also use real spoons and sugar syrup (not sure if that’s the exact term, but it seems better than regular sugar).  Non regular milk is extra but they were nice enough to give me a dash of almond milk when I forgot that they didn’t serve those for free."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Not just for tourists, its an institution in SF.  Forgive all those whom are taking selfies with the iconic ‘blue bottle’ logo cups...we are the tourists.  Always good coffee, good vibe.  Multiple locations means you are never far from your Blue Bottle experience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very skilled baristas, super chill and welcoming, and great interior with lots of natural light! Hard to get a table, and people tend to hold onto them for a long time, but if you don't mind sitting on a stool by the window it's a great view all around. Great place to study, work, or hang out."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Love their coffee but the lines can sometimes be long.  I pop in when the line isn't too bad.  Picked up coffee as gifts and staff made great recommendations.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Superb interior design with large windows provides beautiful views and a great atmosphere to read while sipping overpriced lukewarm coffee provided by over-worked and neophyte workers.  I want to like Blue Bottle but find their superb aesthetic sense and coffee so at odds with customer service; This branch has emotionally constipated staff with a limited sense of hospitality ;  A new Barista in training had made the tepid cappuccino whose goop had leaked onto the plate and the cup handle when it was handed to me !
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee and single origins - recommend lattes without single origin as they have a fruity note, but by an espresso alone with amazing with their single origin espresso  Only downside is this location does not serve breakfast and only has coffee and some light sweets"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Really great, strong coffee. Fresh California cuisine"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Delicious, aromatic coffee! I ordered a latte with oat milk and it was super smooth! Can’t believe it’s a chain but they still kee up their quality"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Blue bottle is always great. Wish they had better breakfast food options though.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"One of my favourite Blue Bottles to visit. I usually stop by in the mornings if I’m waiting for my shuttle to work. It’s usually around 6:30-7:30a on weekdays when I’m here. It’s quiet and I love sitting at the bar stools by the window to people/car/dog watch.  I always get a New Orleans 16oz. If I’m feeling food, it’s the avocado toast or the Belgium waffle. Depending on the toast they use the crust can be really tough to bite through so definitely use cutlery. Otherwise both foods are so yummy! And if you haven’t tried the New Orleans it’s great for anyone who loves iced coffee. It’s not too sweet which is why I like it, but if you’re more of a black coffee human then I suggest to skip this drink."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,One of my go to places for great coffee and a quick meeting if needed in the city.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great service and I love high windows and ceilings great for people watching. The espresso I ordered is solid.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Good service, great coffee and good to sit for a while."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Friendly baristas. Good coffee
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Nicest Blue Bottle location around. Light and spacious, a lot of seating space. Quality of coffee and customer service on a very high level. Recommendation for sure."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Would I come back: Probably not, coffee was pretty good but there was no Wifi / plugs for us to work on.  Value: A teensy bit more expensive but was justified by the richness of the latte.  The Good: The drink we ordered was quite enjoyable and the coffee flavours were smooth and rich. Good balance of milk to foam in the latte.  The Bad: No Wifi / plugs means this is not a place to work - just drink coffee and chat. Not really a fault of the establishment, just not what I personally look for in a coffee shop.  Bath/Rest/Wash-rooms: Clean! It's a kind of a shared bathroom with the rest of the building."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I like blue bottle, however; this place is questionable when it comes to quality. There are good days and bad days. Everyday has been different."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Excellent even outstanding coffee and service, SPACIOUS if you need to work! ;-)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great place , specious and clean . Blue bottle name comes from the story . Ask the barista :)))"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,I love this place. It’s near my school. Especially latte is soft. Coffee menu is so good. However hot chocolate is.... so so.(not that good). I don’t want to recommend hot chocolate.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I really like their coffee, but the price for one cup pour over is outrageous 6.19 $ That is the last time for me here"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Exceptional coffee although they can have long queue at peak times
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Famous coffee shop Love the atmosphere, environment And the kindly baristas"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,It is a great place to go get coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great tasting coffee and espresso spot, they do nice latte art and the place is cozy."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Waffle was very good! Latte was decent. Wait was very long, very limited seating & no outlets."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great spot to sip on latte art coffee. Staff super friendly and large windows make it comfy drinking latte and watching traffic move by.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Freshly made drip coffee and friendly staff. The waffles tastes good.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Comfortable cafe. Friendly staff. Great coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Iced Nola is always my go to and it never disappoints.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very nice coffee shop  💕 great music, and friendly service. …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I love blue bottle and their coffee and usually I get incredible customer service. I came in this morning to pick up coffee beans and filters, the cashier working there looked at me w/o saying a word and kept staring at me as I looked for the right beans for my boyfriend.  When I found them I grabbed the bag and headed to the back of the store to pick up filters. As I make my way to the back where the filters are, the cashier spoke loudly and said “I can help you right here!” After letting them know I was headed to get filters, they told me to “go ahead.” I felt as if they thought I was about to steal a bag of beans from the store? I felt like I wasn’t trusted or welcomed there.  Even when I purchased my items, I just felt weird. It was such an odd interaction, an interaction I wasn’t expecting from Blue bottle. It just broke my heart."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Thought my coffee tasted funny, turns out they default to oat milk now 🤨 they should warn us innocent bystanders! …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Absolutely decadent coffee - liquid deliciousness.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Best coffee in town and cool place.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Amazing place to visit but full of people all the time. Need more  time when you visit.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very good coffee but it takes forever to get it, I’ve waited 10+ minutes for a cappuccino"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Clean location. Lot's of seating. Fantastic coffee.  Baristas who take their creations very seriously at a snails pace.   I've sat waiting longer than 30 minutes for an espresso before.  That was with a short line. With a long line, you'd better not have anywhere to go.  Considering there are so many other coffee place, they get by on name and quality, not efficiency."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Lovely location. Coffee is great and the Baristas are very friendly. Only thing lacking was food options.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Nice experience and staff. Coffee is on the bitter side but not to the point of tasting burnt.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle serves up a great cup of coffee with a decent price tag. With that said, it's still great coffee. If you want something strong, I highly recommend their cold brew, something sweet then their iced coffee, and something creamy then their latte. Actually all their coffee options are great.  This location is super super busy during the work week. You can almost always expect a line but it moves pretty fast. The cafe is lined with large windows that gives you a nice view of the street for people watching and allow the illusive SF sunshine to pour through and illuminate the cafe. There is seating if you prefer to enjoy your cup of coffee in the cafe."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,I think from a tourist point of view we thoroughly enjoyed this cafe but it may be a bit expensive if you go on a regular basis.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,I always enjoy having early morning business meeting here.  My only complaint is that it does get quite crowded and you have to wait for your coffee.  Otherwise the coffee is worth the price to speak with some people say and it really is enjoyable to sit at that corner and want you to go by. I just completed a meeting here this week and really enjoyed it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very nice location, the building is beautiful and full of details. The coffee Is good and with a vast option. They have a nice selection of breakfast meals.  Pricing is aligned with other coffee shops in the area. Downside, they do not have WiFi and seating options are limited. Overall, this is a nice coffee place to go to."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I love their iced latte and New Orleans.  Pros of this place --> just like any other Blue Bottle Coffee, great coffee and nice staff.  And I like that this place has the high ceiling which makes you feel a bit liberated.  Cons of this place --> little bit too crowded especially around the lunch time. Sometimes hard to find a seat (also just like other Blue Bottle). However, great to have Blue Bottle Coffee around!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"[Edit: Their quality has gone down substantially since Nestle bought 'em. They're better than Starbucks but not by much.] Solid good coffee. Well-lit. Fast service. Not the most exciting roaster anymore, but reliably great."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Cool space, super busy always but the line moves. Consistently good pour overs."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle is a great coffee shop but it is waaay to expensive for what it is. You should be able to get a quality latte for less than $6! Besides that, this shop is shockingly slow. When I was there it was a 30 min wait between order and drink. Chairs look good but are not comfortable. There are so many coffee shops in the city, skip this one."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"The coffee here is good (just like it is at all the Blue bottle locations across the city), but the queue here can be brutal especially at peak hours (morning, lunch, afternoon).  Definitely recommended to come here for coffee, but I’d plan for waiting 10-15 minutes for your coffee if you arrive when there is a big line already."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle is not my favorite coffee roaster in the Bay Area, but I do happen to stop into this location the most due to proximity to work. The coffee is decent. Espresso is the best offering in my opinion (the affogato is the best thing on the menu). The waffles have an intoxicating smell and taste. Unfortunately the staff is a little ""too cool for school"" and lack hospitality."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I met a friend here for a coffee play date.  (We left immediately after she arrived.)  I had both an almond steamer and an apple cider.  Both were good/acceptable.  Perhaps I will go back to try latte in the near future.  Judging the ambience, however, I will not be going back for any kind of sit down stay.  This place was unreasonably loud, hipster/yuppie/finance customers were rather rude, and there were no electrical outlets, and it's overcrowded.  I had to wait 20 minutes just to sit down at a communal table of 8.  When my friend arrived we decided to leave because we would just be shouting at each other, which is not conducive to any type of intimate conversation.  I really wanted to like this place.  One plus was the cashier. She was friendly.  Unfortunately, that was overshadowed by the ridiculously long wait at the coffee bar to pick up my order."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This isn't a very comfortable place to sit down and have a coffee, but if you are just passing by and you need a caffeine fix, it's decent. Their coffee takes a while and there is often a line given the area that this building is in. I got myself a latte and was very pleased with it. I sat at the counter which wasn't terribly comfortable, but I wasn't necessarily looking to relax."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very nice shop in a historic building.  The focus is definitely on the customer experience, as their drink making area looks tiny for the staff to move around in.  Having a full bar right across the way is cool, as you can combine the two if you really wanted to by sitting in one of the common areas.  The Financial District is cool, if you can find parking that isn't going to cost you a first born child or outright deny you if you're not in a Smart Car."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Be prepared to wait 20 min for your coffee - even during non-peak times
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"During a coffee tour I stopped in here and was at first struck by how spacious and bright everything was. If you're looking to curl up with a cup of coffee somewhere cosy, this is not the place for you. That being said, I love the bright 'Apple store' style and appreciate that the tables are quite far apart so you can enjoy your coffee in peace. Playing low key r&b this morning, I'm very happy.  The coffee isn't the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. It's strong, tasty and unlike some of the other 'gourmet' coffee places doesn't take a day and age to get it.  There's no wifi, nowhere to charge your devices so it's not a place to stay for a long time but it's a good place to sit and people watch while you enjoy a cup of delicious coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"No outlet, small cups, dry service. Nothing special about their croissant or coffee. Truly disappointed with the decoding of the number of rates given to BBC."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Top looking coffee place $6.5 for latte Professionally looking staff Taste is okay
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This location is very large and well decorated. The service is as you have come to expect at blue bottle. That means good!  The bar drink was a little on the warm rather than hot side but it was still well made, creamy and good. Long line at this location as it is in the financial district."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"It was slow service, the drinks are made inconsistently, and it is SOOOO HOT in that shop. I feel horrible for the staff they need A/C, fans or some windows that open."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Good coffee and waffles but little overpriced !!
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"No matter what time of day this Blue Bottle is popular BUT don't fear the line! The coffee is worth the wait. My favorite choices are the New Orleans Iced Coffee or your (not so) standard latte. On a occasion I decide to treat myself and get a waffle while I'm there too - you should definitely get it the next time you're there :) Blue Bottle, I love you a latte."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This blue bottle location is convenient to Montgomery Bart and fidi. There's usually a wait - five to fifteen minutes - and it is crowded enough that lots of unpleasant things occur like random people taking your drink by mistake, the barista not getting your drink right, the cashier being unable to hear you, and so forth. It's really unpleasant all around, but it's convenient.  As coffee goes it's middle of the road, not the worst you've had but they don't do a great job, either. This location is really just about getting coffee quickly and getting out, despite the pretty interior.  Across the street at 225 Bush is Coffee Culture; they have better beans and they usually aren't crowded, the price is comparable and they will mess up your drink about as often (they'll get it right but it will be made poorly), and the rest of the time it's great and there's somewhere to sit and you don't have to watch for elbows from the local crowd."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Very unique place in SF and interesting.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I could give this place 5 stars for just the liege waffles. I don't drink caffeine, but this is still a go-to spot for me. I get the decaf iced almond milk latte and it is wonderful (but pricey). I also get a waffle. They are always friendly and do well considering they are constantly busy."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"The line is long so be prepared to wait a bit. I ordered a drip coffee which took about an extra ten minutes to prepare. The coffee, however, was enjoyable and tasty. Blue Bottle Coffee uses quality ingredients in their products and then handcraft the beverages."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This is a very busy location for coffee in downtown San Francisco. I love the wide variety of coffee options they offer - the cold brew was delicious, and the american was also very good. My order was filled in a timely manner by the friendly staff."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Nice coffee.. Friendly staff.. Don’t miss their Latte
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Favorite Coffee spot in all of the city. The difference between a latte and a cappuccino is lost on a lot of baristas, but Blue Bottle's staff always makes them right. The way they get that creamy mouthfeel on the Breve latte is amazing.  Coffee beans are super high quality and great value. If my girlfriend liked lighter roasts, it would be my go to bean."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Nice locale (if you like the sparse museum look) friendly and cheerful staff. Great pretzel but the super expensive drip coffee tasted like... weak tea.  I guess I'm spoiled by my frequent visits to Italy but I'm used to coffee tasting of coffee. Not coffee that has a passing resemblance to the idea of what a rough sketch of coffee might taste like.  Especially at that price.  I've later come to realize I was supposed to buy the magic iced coffee thing so in the end I guess the joke is on me.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of the cafe at first because it had an excellent modern style interior, for example, white marble tables, wood menu boards, hanging lights and high ceilings, etc. I felt that it was really sophisticated. I had the Uganda drip coffee. I recommend the Uganda drip coffee for people who like a bright, light-roast coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Excellent coffee, service was mixed. I was really looking forward to visiting Blue Bottle as I make it a habit to visit all the best third wave coffee houses. I ordered two coffees, one affogato and two bags of coffee. I also wanted to buy one of their coffee mugs but they had run out. They offered the one on display but wouldn't discount which is OK as it only had a scuffed bottom and the inner packaging was ripped. No big deal but a few dollars off would have been a nice gesture. They forgot the two coffees but the Barista did them at no charge which made up for the mug and more. I then (being a pain in the butt) decided to change the bags of coffee for another type after trying the coffee and deciding it was too heavy for my tastes (giant steps). One guy said the new bags are cheaper and would refund me, another guy went to do the refund and said Hayes Valley espresso was actually the same price so no refund. No problem but through most of this it wasn't particularly friendly service. They are busy and probably just tired after a long day serving but I had hoped for a slightly better experience; I was probably unlucky."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This place is chaotic. That being said my latte was tasty. ☕  It was also relatively easy to find two spots together to speak but I wouldn't count on this being an easy place to have a coffee meeting. Especially during peak hours.  Sidenote... I'm also always disappointed in blue bottle's tiny cup sizes. They size their drinks as if they are a bespoke shop but they arent. They are practicing on every corner in SF. However, the coffee is tasty so I'll just keep paying for my tiny cup😂"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I really enjoy Blue Bottle, one of the few places in the US that really understands coffee. They're always crowded and the line is usually six to eight deep but they get through it pretty quick and I've only ever had decent coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"A frustrating experience. The drip coffee was absolutely delicious, possibly the best I've tasted. But I firmly believe that a coffee shop is more than just a box which turns the best part of $5 (yes, that many!) into bean-exposed hot water. It should be a place to pause, think, read, talk, or just to be. So to the owners, you've done to difficult bit; if you want my three additional stars, invest in some proper chairs, a table or two, and a bloody wifi router."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Like the place, it's pretty good to enjoy your coffee, like the macchiato"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Interestingly located Blue Bottle in a busy building. Tons of foot traffic here, so if you are going at any sort of busy time expect to wait, both in the ordering line and when waiting for your drink to be made. Good luck floating through the crowd of caffeinated humanity.  As far as the coffee, it's Blue Bottle. So it'll be damn good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Delicious coffee, but you can expect a line since so many people end up here after hopping off Bart or on their way up to their offices. They most pretty quickly. Lots of people also stay and eat/drink at the tables as well."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"This is a great street level indie coffee shop. Overpriced, but absolutely delicious pastries and good coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,A little expensive but the coffee *cannot* be beat. The pastries were lovely. The Kenyan brew I got was so flavorful and my husband's mocha was the best I've ever tasted.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I love Blue Bottle. It's definitely my favorite espresso in the city, if not coffee in general (though Philz is way up there, just a different type of coffee experience). Anyhow, back to Blue Bottle. This location, in particular, can be a little tricky. It can be super busy, which means finding a seat (or two, if you're with a friend) can be quite challenging. And if you do find your seat, the just-below-boil humdrum of the patrons is just chaotic enough that it's hard to hear your name being called for your order. And if you're alone, you don't want to give up your seat for a fake-out. Nonetheless, I still like coming here."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Excellent blue bottle location in the heart of SF financial district. This place is always packed with business meetings, but the line moves relatively quickly and seats do tend to open up by the time your coffee is ready (sometimes)."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Best. Coffee. Around. It's a chain but still definitely worth it for the quality of the coffee. Please bare in mind that I like my coffee black, strong and rather bitter – not everyone's taste. I drink Long Blacks (or short Americano or Long Pull) or Espresso."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great place for a San Francisco business meeting and I sometimes meet my customers here early in the morning and it is fantastic.  My only critique is that it does get quite crowded and you sometimes have to wait a while for your coffee and if you need your coffee like I do..
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle - amazing SF coffee. This location does get pretty busy, but you can sometimes find a seat or two. Get the New Orleans iced coffee. It's so creamy and delightful!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I disliked Blue Bottle for many years. But when they opened up next doir to my place of employment, I afforded them a second chance. Delicious coffees served in a bright, cheerful shop. Avoid the lines of bright young things."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Bought my best friends wedding gift of coffee beans here! I love how they are so aromatic. A small bag is quite pricey however, about $12-14 a bag."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Cannot go wrong with blue bottle still provides excellent coffee. However, deducting one star because the pour over was done a little sloppy, it doesn't taste as good as before."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,This is the first Blue Bottle that offers spacious seating in downtown SF. The decor is hip and elegant. They offer the geisha from Columbia (not Panama) which I must try next time. Staff is friendly.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"We were extremely dissappointed. The coffee tasted watery and I did not get the order I asked for. The coffee shop around the corner, Bread and Cocoa, offers organic coffee of superior taste, and a greater array of food choices."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Really friendly barista! Latte was delicious I got something lactose intolerant. I think it was an oat latte. They were out of the nitro Brew if I remember correctly. They specifically asked what my name was and the two baristas were both guys and they were really nice. My friend and I were from out of town and they gave us some advice on sightseeing!
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Such a gorgeous location in a historic building!! The go-to spot for tech meetings.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I'm taking the seat near the window, staring at the deserted Sansome Street on this Sunday morning, and thinking to myself: why do I keep paying $4 for a small cup of Cappuccino. Why.  Thoughts spinning while my body is slowly handling the coffee. Still no conclusion.  I give up, grab my bag, and get a $4 Croissant on the way out.  Nicely done, Blue Bottle."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I visit 3rd wave coffee shops in cities around the world, traveling with my job or for personal reasons. After reading about Blue Bottle many times on sites like Coffeegeek and HB I was really looking forward to going when I was in SFO last month...  Unfortunately the line up was long and only lead to a miss with a bitter and overpriced espresso. It was a nice space... but that's about it...  edit: I see Nestle has bought Blue Bottle... fitting end."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I liked this coffee place where you can comoftably sit and have a conversation. They had great coffee and prompt service. The same place have both a bar and coffee shop closeby, so you can choose whichever pleases u at the moment."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Really special coffee place, an SF icon almost. Great brews, especially the cold brew. Fast professional and friendly staff. Highlight recommend for real coffee lovers."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,A place that has a picture of a blue bottle and nothing else to describe what it wants to be has got to be trendy.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I had a decaf Americano bc they don't brew decaf drip. It was strong, which was great, since I usually find Americanos weak. It's very loud. But it's a pretty shop in an old SF building with high ceilings and tile floors."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Fantastic coffee and great place to take a break. The staff is super friendly and the prices are not too much more than other shops. The bathrooms here are clean and nice as well.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Expensive and a bit slow,  but nice cafe in the heart of the financial district. Good for morning business meetings."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I normally would give blue bottle 5 stars but today i experienced starbucks burnt quality cappuccino. My cap tasted burned and the almond milk did not taste like real almond milk . i always get my cappuccino with almond milk, but they have recently changed the almond milk they are using.  they used to use Marin Living Foods Almond milk, and now they are using some cheaper brand Califia which has additives in it.  I am paying for a quality product and want that and have always had that kind of quality with blue bottle.  Please change back to the way you have done it before."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Good coffee but you're paying $5 for a small coffee just for the hype.  And you have to wait as they brew one cup at a time.  So is the coffee incidentally better than Peets or similar.  Meh.  I guess, by 1% or so.  Does that difference justify the extra coat, wait, hype?  Nah."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Excellent latte, which is frustratingly hard to find in the states! This place gets busy though, so expect to line up to order. The staff are quite efficient though, so the wait times aren't too bad."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee, beautiful atmosphere! Would be 5 stars if it wasn't so busy: expect long lines and very little available seating between 9 am and 10:30 am."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee. Priced kinda high. If there is a long line then the wait can be long. Takes another 15 minutes after you order to get your drink.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"I learned about Blue Bottle coffee when I was looking for great coffee shops in downtown SF, and I haven't been disappointed any of the times I've gone. Easily one of my favorite cappuccinos."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,As a self proclaimed coffee fanatic this is simply the best quality coffee.  It is going to take about ten minutes for your pour over.  Take it easy in the beautiful environment while you wait.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee but it's a might bit pricey. I was worried that them having been purchased by Nestle would affect their quality, but they seem to be pretty consistent."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,$5.6 for a big matcha which is amazing. I sensed a bit of sweetness in the matcha but it was still good. $0.15 if you bring your own cup.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee. Sadly it deliberately chose not to have power ports for laptop users and people running low on battery. Also a lot of noise disturbance from the bar next door.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"The Apple of the coffee world. Stunning store, great staff and their milk work is superb. Velvety soft flat whites. Amazing"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Love Blue Bottle. I'm from Chicago suburbs, travel to San Francisco few times a year, buy beans from various sources and grind myself. LOVE Blue Bottle' s various roasts. Always make a trip to BB when in town."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Always good coffee with much creama
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Good coffee. A little over hyped and the line was long, but staff is friendly and it's a great environment. Watching them prepare the coffee is the best part."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Really bad service. Ordered a small latte, a tea, and a scone. After waiting for 20mins for my latte I left without it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Stopped here for a coffee to go Will stop there again
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle is nothing short of perfection. This location is bright, cozy for all, and pure bliss. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a drink while you’re in the area."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Nice place to get a coffee. Not much in the way of food, but beautiful building - light and bright. It's a Starbucks for actual coffee lovers."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great selection of excellent coffees. Noisy, amplified by the shape of the interior. And limited food, Belgian waffle is pretty good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"A breakfast black tea for $4 that doesn't have much taste, the husband's $5 latte is way too mild/mellow, something's changed... Not the place to go after a night of partying!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"The best Blue Bottle location in the city. Bright, airy, bustling. There's often a sizable line, but it winds through a historic lobby that is a sight to behold."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,There's always a line here for coffee and it takes a while to get your coffee and food. I wish they had better seating. Coffee is worth the wait if you can afford to wait.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Fantastic location. I actually got here right as they opened and got a coffee, muffin, and table right away, but the crowd picked up almost instantly. Expect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great space for a coffee. Pour over is very good. Doesn’t have the menu for food some other branches have, but good pastries and waffles."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Everyone has been telling me to come here for the coffee. Let me tell you, definitely a must! I come here on the weekends to read my paper and have a latte (or two). My only complaint is that they keep running out of the lemon poppyseed slice! C'mon, guys, stock up!😉 …"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Recently visited SF and went to this location everyday.  Great coffee and beautiful space.  Their iced latte is my fav I've ever had.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Good coffee, great ambience."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Love their coffee and waffle. Get pretty busy during the weekday rush hours, but the staff there is good with giving fast service"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee. Get the caramelized belgian S style Liege Waffle. If you need wifi or an outlet go to the local Starbucks.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,The waffle was really great. They make it fresh for you and it was steaming hot perfect for a cold morning. Love the affogatos!
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee. This is a pretty busy location and hence be ready for longer waits during typical coffee hours. I think the coffee is totally worth the wait.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,It's a great modern cafe. Good meeting place downtown. And the coffee is not too bad either.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"A beautiful blue bottle coffee shop. The queue can be lengthy and it can take about 20 minutes to get your coffee. However, it's a great place to wait!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Probably the best coffee in SF. Can take some time to make it but well worth the wait - the Batista's do a really good job
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Got the winter latte. Very good coffee but no distinctive flavor to indicate ""winter"". Not that different from the cafe latte."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee and a good location.  The wait can be a little long at times and seems to get loud if you are looking for a place to work.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,visited during busy hours right after lunch but service was quick and coffee was great. baristas seemed joyful
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Amazing coffee. Strongly recommended.  I loved their cappuccino and chocolate cookie.  No wifi available though.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"So, so slow. The place was basically empty, there were 4 people behind the counter but my cappuccino still took over 10 mins. It wasn't anything special either."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Came here for a quick meeting. Very crowded but great coffee! The fresh waffles are also delicious!
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee and excellent service.  Gotta have my waffle with a cup of some good single origin.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"A great place to go, wait in line a while to order, then wait even longer for a coffee.  Tastes good, though."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Giant Steps and Bella Donna are excellent dark coffees. Be warned the bar across the hall plays obnoxiously loud music after 6.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,No wifi?! I thought free internet was a staple of all cafes in the Tech Town. Great coffee and nice ambiance but no WiFi means I won’t be back often
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,The best coffee chain in San Francisco
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee and waffles but way to slow making the drinks and it wasn't been busy, waffle was made and a eaten way before my coffee arrived"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee, cool vibe. Kind of expensive but that's not really new. Wish they had power outlets."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee, atmosphere.  The baristas are extremely friendly and helpful.  Love this place!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Love this spot. Best pour over and latte’s in town. And the waffles are a must if you’ve never tried them.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Nice environment but the coffee selection are not a lot.  I would prefer Starbucks with stronger taste.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"awesome afogato but the service is sooooo slow, they have like 15 baristas and omgooosh it takes forever, don't go if you have city pace or if you are in a rush, you have to go on the mood like when you go to a restaurant because they will take about 20 mins to give you your order."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Why would anyone in SF go to crappy Starbucks when you could have a real coffee from Blue Bottle. Best cappuccino I've had in the US.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Best coffee so far in San Francisco. Amy Aussies on the area missing your latte or cappuccino, head to a Blue Bottle Cafe."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"If you want a delicious cup of craft coffee, made with care and love, look no further. The staff will make your day."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee in a busy place. You can watch the crowd while you enjoy your cup.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Nice place! But too much crowd.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee choices and unique coffee taste - that's what separates Blue Bottle from the rest of the shops.

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee, full of vibrant, loud folks talking tech. Great spot for tourists to experience  modern, American coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,A little pricey but solid for what it is. I recommend a Gibraltar which was invented in an SF Blue Bottle. The waffles are great as well.

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Great coffee, but wow you are ally pay for it.$$$$$, also went there for a meeting and there was no seating.  the coffee was good though and the staff was nice."

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Ambience is pretty loud. Not a low key coffee shop. Great coffee and tea though

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Coffee is so smooth and the baristas are really artistic topping off the espresso drinks with lovely floral pics.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,I love the pour over system they use for brewing.  Definitely worth trying if you are visiting SF.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Amazing coffee in a nice building. Try the cold brew (New Orleans or Three Africans). Worth the wait.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Good coffee, nice service, accessible location. Can get crowded and slow in the afternoon during the weekday."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Good service but a bit pricey to me!
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Lots of natural lighting and high ceilings. You can't beat the quality here. The line takes a while but the smells draw you in. Usually a crowd here with noise bouncing off the walls.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Delicious waffle but the drip coffee was more like tea than coffee. It might have to do with my Swedish expectations of coffee.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,NOLA Iced Coffee is the best cold brew. I like their consistency vs Philz.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Amazing Drip coffee. Nice atmosphere. Watching the people brewing coffee has something very mesmerising

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great coffee spot on the edge of FiDi. Always packed so be ready to hawk for chairs if you want to sit down
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great espresso drinks.  It got pretty busy and there was a line. Nice seats skiing the window.

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Located in beautiful lobby! Good coffee! Cafe was a little messy for noon hours.
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Decent coffee but incredibly long wait. At any point in the day, expect a 10-20 minute wait."
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Over priced hard to have a conversation there. And to be honest I had a hard time a cashier to answer any of my questions. Haven't been back since.

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Great pour-over. Latte art is on point! Really spacious space in the Financial District

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Very good coffee, too crowded I mean toooo crowded and also a bit steep for drip coffee(4$+)"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Super busy place! But the coffee and the waffles are really really good and worth the (short) wait.

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,Best coffee in town
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"A place where you can have delicious coffee.  There are small blue bottle houses between the office buildings. It is perfect for enjoying a cup of coffee on the way to work. Because of its small scale, the product lineup is meager.  But what's wrong with that? You can drink delicious and fresh coffee in a pleasant morning and buy a nice coffee crop!  Sending joy this morning to Blue Bottle and Nestle. :-)"

Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"It's nice because it's open, and the amount of Americano is much less than in Korea. the taste is soso"
Blue Bottle Coffee,115 Sansome St,"Blue Bottle Coffee in a building. You have to walk into the building to find the entrance of the store. Since this store is located in the downtown area of San Francisco, it is not easy to find a parking space nearby, especially at noon. Nearby office workers will come here to buy a cup of coffee, and they have to wait in line for more than ten minutes. There are few seats in the store, and the seats by the window are almost taken away for a long time. Some students discuss homework, do homework, or a group of friends gather and chat here. But the blue bottle coffee is delicious, and the service provided by the clerk is very good. Although there is always a queue, their clerk serves quickly and can provide you with the coffee you need immediately."
