Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"This is a beautiful coffee shop, very spacious with enough tables and seating areas for you to study or hang out. In addition, they have outdoor sitting areas.They have a limited and solid menu and the prices are fair. Everything is very clean and the place had a nice decoration and vibe. The service was great very friendly. Come here!"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Cool spot to get beverage. I got matcha latte. A bit surprised that it is not sweet at all. Then I appreciate why it is unsweetened: so I can appreciate the matcha taste and the natural sweet taste of the milk. The staff is friendly and the shop is busy in a good way. I had a good time conversing with friends about life philosophy and Buddhism there. Would love to go try some pastries next time!
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Great atmosphere and great coffee. I love working remotely here, during the workday and on weekends it’s a fun and lively atmosphere. Workers are cool and there’s always some 80s-90s movie playing on tiny VHS TV.  Honestly worth checking out just to laugh at their coffee-themed parody VHS horror movie collection. Cronenberg’s The Brewed cracks me up"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Came for the first time today to try something new. Customer service is by no means friendly, but neither are they rude. Didn’t really feel welcomed. Seating is severely limited and it was crowded. No place to put or work on my computer so it stayed in the bag. I finished my drink quickly and ended up going to Peet’s."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Cute coffee shop in trendy Cole Valley. It’s very bare bones right now due to the pandemic. No indoor seating. Also offers a pretty minimalist espresso and coffee menu. The Matcha Green Tea was nice and earthy.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"I went for the first time this past weekend. The staff were so nice and from the conversations overheard, they seem to really make an effort to form connections with customers who live nearby or frequent the cafe.  Decent amount of seating in the cafe, and I found a table with an outlet nearby. Nice cafe to work out of.  I ordered a matcha latte and a morning bun. Not as impressed with the morning bun (have had better ones around the city) but the matcha latte was great and the sugar level is adjustable."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,This is a quirky coffee shop to stop in while you are on your way to hike Mount Sutro. I was very impressed by the taste and texture of their espresso. 5 stars! This is what you can find here: Intelligentsia beans for espresso style drinks Craftsman’s and wolves pastries Ritual beans for drip coffee
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Best coffee in Cole valley/upper Haight area… I go here all the time. The mocha and vanilla are legit… love that nothing is too sweet. Amazing vibe, great staff."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Unfortunately the male owner/ manager is not very friendly here.  I echo the sentiments of those feeling unwelcome here.    Great space for a cafe.  Coffee is just OK and food options are limited.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"We have loved the owners of Wooden since they worked in the Inner Sunset! Delicious coffee, wonderful ambiance, and relaxed and unpretentious place to be."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"I’m not really to leave bad reviews, but this coffee house won the price today!  Order a small black coffee and a small cappuccino $11 later when I get my black coffee I asked the cashier for room for sweetener and milk  Cashier proceeds to fill the cup to the very top, tells me milk is an extra charge… closes my coffee with the lid and doesn’t even give me the opportunity to pay for something that at any other coffee house is offered for free!  I had to walk to peet’s to get my coffee fixed!  If I could give this place a negative star I absolutely would!"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Does have a few vegan items but unfortunately charges extra for vegan milk.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"First time in,  will definitely be back!  Ordered a cappuccino,  it was, and I'm not exaggerating,  perfect! I am a seasoned barista myself,  so I know what good coffee is supposed to taste like,  and this was it! The milk temp was perfect,  it was just right at the sweet spot. Foam,  perfect. A delicate layer of micofoam so creamy and soft. The espresso shot was perfect, sweet and delicious. The vibe inside was super chill with a retro throw back of 80s VHS's on display and playing on a little TV.  The staff was polite and attentive.  The barista watched as I sipped the foam before placing the lid, I could tell they genuinely cared about the drink they created for me.  They also put a lovely heart on top, but I was so excited to drink it,  it only lasted a few seconds.  This experience definitely put a smile on my face and gave me a little more faith in humanity.  10/10 definitely recommend."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"1. Good if you like acidic coffee. 2. Atmosphere is nice and the location is great for work and mid afternoon breaks. 3. Average price for drinks.  I personally prefer more bodied coffee, however I feel that San Francisco produces acidic coffee in general."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Nice, comfy cafe in Cole valley downtown. Wish it had more seating but great vibe."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"You can look at my profile, I barely ever leave bad reviews, but I walked out of this location very upset. I’m sort of down on my luck right now, and walked in to ask if they have anything for two dollars or less so I can charge my phone, and the man at the counter didn’t even look up, or acknowledge me at all, he just said “no” quietly, and waited for me to leave so he could help the next person. Making things worse, as I was walking out the door, I saw a two dollar drink in the fridge. I’m not homeless, but I’m guessing he thought I was, which makes it even worse because I can now see how this business treats community members having a hard time. I’m telling all my friends do not support this business."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Love that Wooden is in the neighborhood. Steve, Bruce, Iveet and Alex are great and all make an effort to get to know the locals. Coffee is consistent and good so much so that it’s really hard for me to go to other places. I’ve been spoiled by their Vanilla Latte - typically not my order of choice as most places use that fake sugary vanilla. I trusted Alex once to try it and it’s now my go-to. Love the muffins they get Friday - Sunday and for the other days of the week the banana bread is heaven.  Line can get long, so expect that on weekends especially later in the morning. Take the moment to breathe, make a friend and just chill."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Super friendly staff and nice coffee. The best part was the cheddery biscuit and the free candy they had set out for Halloween.  There's a cute bench outside you can sit at but otherwise no outdoor seating.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Great little spot in a neighborhood that needed a coffee shop (no Pete's doesn't count).  The staff is awesome and the coffee is excellent with drip, pour overs, cold brews, along with all espresso drinks.  Seating is a bit funky but maybe its bc we are close to Haight.  Barista approved"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Nice local coffee shop. Staff is very friendly. Not a large selection of pastries, but what they have is pretty good.  They have an old tv with a VHS player and a large selection of films for it on one side. A welcome distraction on those days I come by myself."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,They leave the front doors open in the morning making it cold inside. Coffee cups very small for the price.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Cute coffee shop with yummy lattes. True to their name, there is also a lot of wood decor. My favorite part though, is the shelf of old movies in the back that are all renamed with coffee related themes."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Had the 'Thing' a signature caramel cinnamon latte vibe, deliciously hitting all the right spots to kick start the weekend. Very straightforward neighborhood cute corner cafe."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Good espresso with balance!
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Do yourself a favor and grab a breakfast taco! They have a few varieties - every one I've tried has been great - and a small enough portion that I don't feel guilty. Coffee here is excellent! While I love the pour overs, I find the house coffee is not much of a step down. Friendly service with just enough kitchy items inside to make it feel homey. Some day I'll pick up one of the cute cat dishes they have for sale."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Great coffee in a fun environment despite the semi-rude clientele.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Came in a little bit later in the day for a decaf Americano - it was mostly empty but the cafe was very tidy! The service was quick and friendly, would be happy to go back. :)"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Good coffee, mice staff, interesting décor."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Wooden Cafe is a cozy cafe in Cole Valley. The people who work here are friendly and quick with making your coffee. I've been here before and had The Thing, which was a latte with cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices. It tasted similarly to a gingerbread cookie. This time, I opted for an single espresso shot. I was looking for something that I would down easily and that hit the spot. I definitely would recommend anyone to stop by this place if you're in the area!"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"I come on Sunday mornings to watch the bird, a gray parrot which the owner brings to hang out in the shop.  Is it the best coffee in SF?  No, but its pretty good.  Is it the only coffee place with a live mascot?  As far as I know, yes."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Great service and great vibes. Coffee is great and good selection of sweet and savory breakfast bites.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Favorite coffee shop in the city for sure. Excellent lattes. Great staff. Cool ambiance.
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Cute neighborhood spot with solid coffee
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Great coffee. Really fun ambiance with the mock movie covers. I like that the owner works there - it's a nice neighborhood place. It's really fun to visit when Santos the parrot is ""working""."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"This is a great place if you like a cool atmosphere, good music (a lot of 4AD music for those who know),  and excellent espresso drinks. The staff really makes you feel at home. Top notch cafe all around."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Cortado was strong, dark roast but rich with aroma. Will repeat to try other coffees"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Cute coffee shop with a great vibe and cute kitschy decor. I loved their signature drink “the thing”
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Aaaaa, wish this place were open for indoor seating. It's quite nice/cozy inside. I have to say the cappuccino is solid. Staff was friendly. Recommend this."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Amazing cappuccino, love this cafe"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"The best coffee in cole valley and the upper haight, bar none! If you like it sweet, ask about their homemade vanilla 👀 …"
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,"Not impressed simply because I came all this way cuz of the good reviews and saw that their details on google maps was incorrect (it claims to have indoor seating, is does not have it). As a business owner, they should take care of these details."
Wooden Coffeehouse,862 Cole St,Great little shop. Love the Halloween decorations every year. Music is great.
