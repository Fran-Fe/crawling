Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Quaint little coffee shop with a relaxing atmosphere. Great service, calm music. Lots of outdoor seating. Straight forward menu with tasty bagels. Great quality coffee. Definitely a nice weekday spot to sit and read a book."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"When I feel the need of a coffee and watch the parade of people anf pets marching up and down Polk St. My order is always a coffee and a kind bar ever once in a while, thus no food rating. The staff is always pleasant and with a smile. They have outside seating tightly up against the window and edge curb. Inside seating available with prime window seating to watch the life parade."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"The chai latte was very sweet, which I enjoyed but I had been expecting the more spiced taste. I haven’t tried their coffee yet.  Nice staff and a cozy inside with seating. They also have outdoor seating that’s covered."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"One of my favorite coffee shops on Polk st! There are several indoor and outdoor seating areas, and I especially liked that they always open up the windows at the front of the shop so even when sitting indoors it feels airy and comfortable!"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,The iced moka coffee with almond milk is excellent! They use espresso and a little bit of chocolate to really enhance the flavors. Strongly recommend.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"This is a wonderful coffee shop. The only drawback is that I was able to get my large coffee, read my newspaper, and pass my time without political haymakers and bloodletting. There was no one to talk to. Am I that difficult to approach? The books are all liberal or literary. This is San Francisco. I get that. There wasn't the shrill Democrat political machine of Tammany Hall, but there was no political discussion I could horn in on. It may have something to do with the deep and narrow design of the space. There is no real place for talk, just sit quietly and read or politely discuss things you have to discuss with your partner. The others are expected to leave you alone. I'm looking for a place to discuss news contentiously but politely, and I haven't found one yet! Wrong button, I guess!"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,$6.75 latte that was hastily made and far too hot. Most expensive latte I’ve had in a while but wanted to support a small shop.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Quaint coffee and breakfast sandwich spot! Kicked off the Saturday morning with an iced latte and egg + cheese bagel! Loved the SF decorations and really enjoyed the latte! I’ll be back 🤩
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,One the best places in San Francisco where I can drink REAL STRONG coffee. My favorite cappuccino with additional shot of espresso . Mmm ! Always work excellent for waking up in the morning !
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"This used to be royal ground coffee, my gf and I were everyday customers then it was the best coffee shop ever where everyone knew our name, I really miss Ahab at the cashier. I recently stopped in to check if the quality was anywhere near the old owner (royal ground). I never got a chance to order, as soon as I was getting ready to place my order with cashier, the Spanish lady behind the espresso machine began to pick at and wipe her nose. At that point I asked the cashier, “is she the one that will be preparing my drink ?” She said yes, I told her no thanks and left!"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Horrible customer service. I asked for an iced caramel latte half sweet and when I got it, it was TOOOO sweet. I asked the girl to change it and she said she doesn’t know what half sweet means and that this is America not Canada so I should know the number of ‘pumps’ I need. She was so so rude and unwilling to help, apologize, or change my drink."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Worst coffee place ever.  I ordered machiatto, and the cup is so small like a child's cup, bitter, full of creamy foam, the cup was dirty. Not so worth."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"I enjoyed the cafe very much for the simplicity of the coffee, customer service, and seating arrangement. The coffee tasted smooth and fresh. The aroma of the coffee reaped out on to the sidewalk. The bagels we're soft and the cream cheese fluffy. The cafe has a cool mural that represents the life cycle of the coffee. The customer service was outstanding even though the cafe was super busy. The seating area has a window counter with 6 chairs, and the lounge area has a L shaped sofa which feels comfortable. The only negative I encountered was the bathroom, which was very unkept."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Always good! Actual effort put into their Bagel sandwiches. Dirty chai latte stands out amongst the rest. Staff is always helpful.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,I ordered a cappuccino. The coffee was fresh and tasty
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Good coffee and service, decent food. Too much plastic! The espresso was very flavorful and well pulled, and the egg bagel was pretty good, all served with genuine care. Why though, in one of the most progressive cities in the world, is there so much single use plastic here?? Was the only option for water cups, cutlery, etc... no glasses for water, just little plastic cups. Even though I specifically said I was eating here, I couldn’t leave without generating more trash than I’m comfortable with. I know it’s a bit more work for the staff to wash dishes, but hey it’s 2019."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"I've been twice. First latte was very poor -- shallow flavor with a very unappealing chemical taste. I tried again many months later in desperation, and it was the same as the first. I won't be back."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"The coffee is not good (too strong, roast is not good), we had Cappuccino and regular coffee. The bagels are ok (egg cheddar w/o Avocado), but a bit tasteless (some herbs would be good). The Service is ok, we got the wrong order after short discussion  they corrected, but blamed us for that. The Location is very nice und cozy."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Ordered two americanos to go. Coffee was incredible. Almond milk & honey available on the bar. Baristas were kind. Available public restroom. Wonderfully vibrant location -- good music; fun decor. Love everything about Polk street - and everything about this coffee shop. Will be back. Often.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Honestly I am not sure how this place gets good reviews. The coffee was really bitter. I got a caffe latte for over $4 in a really small cup. If you want average coffee then go to Starbucks and at least get more of it. If you want good coffee go to Blue Bottle or Pete's as a minimum. On the plus side. Very friendly staff and good scone - just like you get them in New England.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,a nice coffee shop on polk street it features a great layout with outside seating and open windows with counters to sit at to feel the breeze. The decor is classic coffee shop with sayings and artwork. If you want scenery and a cool place to hang come here if your looking for great service and coffee you might be a bit disappointed the service is up and down depending on the day and the shift
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Visited here for a quick breakfast while visiting recently. The servers are nice and the selection was pretty good for a coffee shop. The location is pretty small but it has plenty of character. The teas are also really tasty. Will definitely return when I visit again.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Food is good, fast service on the chai. However, the lady who was making the sandwiches was spaced out! She asked me three times if it was to go. Asked me if I wanted pesto in my sandwich, to which I replied NO. However, she had put pesto in the sandwich! She had long hair, was getting into the space she was making sandwiches, hello health hazards! She was wearing rubber gloves, touching all the ingredients, then also opening the microwave with those same gloves!!  Not impressed how they touched the food and appliances! I suggest you guys put forks or spoons on all of your ingredients so your employees don’t touch food and everything else at the same time. Please inform your employees to take care of their hair while making sandwiches!  First time here, not going again that’s for sure!"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"This has recently been renovated from one of the many Royal Ground locations. The interior is lovely and much more inviting. I was excited to have a revamped coffee shop on Polk but was sorely disappointed that my Americano tasted dirty which is how Royal Ground coffee has always tasted to me. They have a new, fancy espresso machine so I'm not sure if it's the beans, or the barista, or the machine is not tuned properly.  For better coffee, Contraband is only a few blocks away."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"The staff working were very nice, and the drinks were ready fast! I got a latte and an Americano. Both were super good"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"It's okay. I ordered a flat white to have at the cafe, expecting to have it served in a mug. It came in a paper coffee cup which I find wasteful and not quite the in-house coffee experience I am used to back in Sydney. The coffee was scorching hot so had to let it sit for a few minutes before I could take a sip."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"*edit: received an apology from the owner with the promise to look into the incident and speak to his employee.  I have never been so appalled and offended before. We were a group of 4 professional women having a very serious conversation when the barista suddenly increased the speaker volume. Upon asking her to decrease the volume, she angrily asked us if we were going to buy something else. Then she said she reserves the right to refuse us service (wait did she want us to order something so that she can refuse us service??). Then when we responded with confused looks, she demands that she wants us to leave. Now mind you, my friend had purchased a sandwich and another bought a drink. We had been there for about 45 min (~4:00-4:45pm) and there were no other patrons except one lady with her headphones working away on her laptop. If we were keeping other customers from sitting, being very disruptive, or had been there for 5 hours, I might understand. But none of the above. And then when we got upset at her behavior she blasted the music so much that the lady in headphones took them off to see what was going on. Maybe I should've given the other customer a PSA that if she wasn't going to order anything else soon, she was going to be booted too. I'm still in shock at what happened and the barista can rest happy knowing that I will never again nor ever recommend anyone else to step foot in that establishment."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"They NEED to address the cup/lid situation because the cups/lids provided are beyond terrible. The lid NEVER fit onto my cup securely no matter what I or my husband tried. Not only were our drinks were extremely hot, but mine spilled all over my hands bc the lid would NOT stay on. I guess it tasted ok once it cooled down but it was so difficult and awkward to drink.  I even grabbed extra lids and none of them stayed either. Just going to Starbucks next time."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Loved this coffee shop! Great coffee, I had a latte. Cute and cozy, and we sat at the open window in front with the sun shining in. Loved stopping here on our walk around town."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Delicious egg, bacon, avo sandwich on English muffin. Good coffee with almond milk. $10 total. Friendly service, fast WiFi. Small but cozy seating options. Happy customer 😊 …"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Friendly and fast service. A nice hangout spot with Internet. The mocha coffee was great; the coffee had a pleasant sweetness that didn't have a long lasting coffee aftertaste. Overall, a nice experience and a nice coffee."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"My espresso was great. During the time I was here, service was prompt and friendly for all customers. Nice neighborhood coffeeshop. I will come back if I'm in the area again."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"relaxing, not rushed and friendly. sunny street views. diverse musically."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Cute and cozy interior. Had a deliciously foamy chai latte, which was prepared quickly. It was great! Also additional seating in outdoor parklets."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"this place has an awesome atmosphere, good coffee and the sandwishes are pretty good and i would say cheap (im biased coz i am used to australian prices, but it seems cheap). Loved the music selection (from various countries), prett chilled out. and a plus is: free wifi!"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Very nice neighborhood coffee shop with reasonable prices. Great little parklet and indoor seating.  Truly a community space with billboard. Astrid the barista is terrific!
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,The espresso wasn't good (more sour than bitter). Also serving coffee in paper cups instead of china destroys its taste even more. Nice ambience though.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Fairly priced, well-lit place to get high quality coffee & iced tea.  Nice for plugging in and doing work for a few hours at a time.  Friendly staff."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Coffee and the blond staff members are equally as shite as each other. I only gave it one star due to the free wifi! Only someone with no idea about good coffee will be able drink what they serve.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Moka tastes great and americano was my favorite.
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Terrible service. They assume it's to go. On top of that they don't even offer to redo it. The guy who helped me does not care about espresso if he thinks transferring is no big deal. Save your money (the espresso is even more expensive then at any other place)
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,Worst service ever listen if you wa better coffe go to startubucks they are more nice than any coffee shop if you go there and the barista girl 4pm dont like you she will give you a bad look and she will give you your coffe ery mean I belife startbucks its better  no matter what they always treat you nice i will give moca caffe a 0.1 start  And im gonna start ordering startbucks coffe to my employes i cant belive one of them have and horrible experience anyways by mocka wellcome starbucks coffe im gonna have a brand new machine of multiple choises of coffe
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Great place for studying,wifi works pretty well. Not a very big place though, and although coffees are good, there's stuff competition in San Francisco!"
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Slowest internet on Polk St. When a small cup of coffee is almost $3, 0.5 mbps is not OK."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"They have great oat milk lattes and we tried their breakfast sandwiches this weekend, they were so tasty and we didn’t have to wait long at all."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Such a cute little coffee shop, great selection of drinks, nice atmosphere and cute interior decor. I highly recommend this coffee shop in SF."
Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,The little blond lady has some trouble with smiling and professional service.  Claims she is the owner but she snickers and giggles with her helper when a legitimate complaint is made.

Moka Coffee,1605 Polk St,"Underrated spot, great chai latte and cozy decor!"
