La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I love this place! The coffee is great and inside is quite and relaxing! You have a lot of board games as well, it’s quite big so ideal to come with a big group! The staff are welcoming and polite! The croissant with ham and cheese was delicious! (And you can pick among different cheeses!) I will come back!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This cozy, warm, and chill cafe left a lasting impression on my wife and I! The place has great service and flavorful pastries (try the red velvet). The staff was sweet and friendly! My wife and I recommend everyone to stop by when you’re in San Francisco! We would like to come back here again!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I am on the edge here. Maybe the place is good, and I saw the owner there and he looks supportive and kind.. but I did not feel staff being friendly, just very very neutral.. also I ordered a combo with soup. Sandwich was great, soup … they overheated it in microwave like crazy, plastic lid was melting and left melted plastic on the edge of the carton soup bowl. Overheating also probably affected taste of the soup, since I didn’t really like it. I think if it was left in microwave at least 30 seconds less it would have a better taste, and if I was making it for the customer and see that lid I’d apologize and reheat the new portion of the soup, hopefully before customer would even see it. Owner(or manager in blue shirt) was passing by my table when I was taking pictures of the soup with plans to post this review and maybe did not pay attention, but he did not save experience by walking by to 2 regulars(I think) in the back and greeting them and asking how they are doing, not doing same to me..  I’m now placing 2 stars I hope you will improve in future. And will raise it next time if I have a good experience. I would like to try it again, since coffee was great and sandwich was good too.  The bagel place next to this place is such a huge comparison of how you don’t want your bagel- they sell bagels more expensive and just offer you a can of cream cheese for you to make your bagel for $3 more dollars than this cafe…. So I respect “La Promenade” for being much better than that."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Charming, cozy cafe with delicious drinks, baked goods, and sandwiches. Don’t miss the BLT. Quietish - Lots of students plugged in and working. They have a wall full of previously loved books for $5 each. Would definitely come back. 🙌"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Very nice, place with an European feel. Quiet, games, piano, sofas, nice staff. A relaxing quiet yet live Café! Prices are good, and their breakfast option too! I recommandé the Croissant Doré"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I’ve been coming here for a while but have never left a review -  this is probably my favorite café in San Francisco to date. I have a friend who worked here which is how I heard of it. But often when I come into the city, I like to stop by here because of the good food and chill ambiance. There is a lot of seating, the staff is friendly, there is wifi, and a clean bathroom 😅 It is pretty much an oasis for me in SF. would highly recommend !"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Ok, this is legit the cutest spot and so work-friendly. Everyone is quiet, sipping their lattes, typing away and the music is just the right level and the atmosphere is just perfect. What a beautiful spot."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"its a sweet spot for afternoon study/zoom meeting. theres designated personal space u can have in here. ordered a chai tea and it was amazing. and its so close to the park and u can enjoy excellent view of the ocean and mountains from lands end trail eagles point, about 10min walk. its amazing( ｰ̀εｰ́ )"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"My wife and I love this place!  The owners and the staff have always treated us so well, the ambience is so pleasant, and the food is great!  I had a balboa, and the portion sizes are generous.  Thank you, La Promenade - we'll see you again soon!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,There aren’t any cafes in the area that offer gluten free options and La Promenade is one of them. If you just offered a bread alternative for sandwiches you’d probably see more business. It’s really that easy.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This is a cute place with plenty of seating.  Service was quick.  We ordered our food to go: Hot White Mocha: 10/10.  It's a bit on the sweet side, which we like Iced Vanilla Latte: 10/10 Breakfast Croissant (with ham, egg and cheese): 7/10.  It was ok.  The eggs was like McDonald's eggs and the amount of ham was not substantial enough.  I would definitely come back again for their drinks.  I'll probably try a different food item."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Very nice espresso. Classic European style, dark and a bit bitter... But not too bitter.  Their Monalisa sandwich was amazing."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"$$$ this cafe has a really cute atmosphere. They have coffee, bagels, sandwiches and treats. We got a spiced chai latte and cappuccino, both tasted pretty good however they came out really hot. We got. Turkey club to share, it comes on sourdough bread with one slice in the middle. The sandwich tasted really fresh and the tomato’s were sweet and delicious. I would definitely order the sandwich again!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Your items are delicious, especially the vanilla iced latte. I’ve always enjoyed coming in. But the girl who was working the cashier Wednesday the 19th at 11AM, short white girl with 2 braids in, was unnecessarily rude. I came in with my mom and all she asked for was a latte in the thermal coffee cup brought from home and add a Splenda to it. Her response “ya” with an annoyed face was filled with attitude. My mom then asked if that was okay cause she made it seem through her tone and body language like this is some ridiculous request. Then when my mom walked away she straight up side-eyed her while I was still at the counter. I get customers and requests can annoy you, but talk about it with your coworkers like everyone else once they’ve left the counter. Don’t let that show to the guest…plus why even work in customer service if you’re not happy to get people what they like and want (and are paying for). That’s the whole point of it. The whole interaction was uncomfortable and we decided not to stay and enjoy ourselves. She was not welcoming at all and had so much attitude for no understandable reason. If this was my first time coming in, I wouldn’t be back. And when I do come back, I hope I don’t run into that girl again"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I absolutely love this place. It is part of my morning routine. Great breakfast and lunch sandwich selection prepared by a very polite staff who will make an effort to remember your order. My personal fav is the Super Big E w/ Avo. Yum 😋 and I usually pair it with a Cubano coffee. The coffee here is standard café fair. It’s good quality! Not Ritual or Verve quality but about on par with Peet’s (without all the fancy drinks). Nevertheless it hits the spot every time. Additionally the space itself is huge with tons of table space for friends or coworking, lots of outlets which are labeled whether or not they function, and reliable/speedy free WiFi. For me this is the perfect cozy café to start my day!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This is a really cute spot that has a rustic charm! I've gone here a few times to do some work and I would definitely come back if I lived closer.  Pros: -They have wifi and outlets -They have good vegan/vegetarian options  Some ""cons"" (not really, though): -Some of the seats, couches and tables are sticky. -The benches are not the most comfortable to sit on.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for those working from home! It's not particularly quiet (at least when I've been), but great for busywork or even meeting up with friends."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,A very cozy place with lots of seating. House coffee & hot tea was good. Price reasonable. We also shared a bagel with cream cheese. That was good but a little pricey.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I absolutely love this place! Great ambience, I love how large the space is. Excellent coffee and pastries, particularly the iced lemon cake. I just wish they were open much later than 5pm! A lot of people in the neighborhood would love to come here after work or in the evening for dinner."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Nice café in Richmond, great for waiting for the movie next door :) the coffee and expresso drinks were very enjoyable. apparently the sandwiches are quite good as well.  Large seating area and good ambiance."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Cafe with a very cool interior. The breakfast sandwich was quite reasonably priced and half decent. They have both spiced and vanilla chai.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Trash customer service. All I ever order is a black drip coffee and I can't even get properly acknowledged when I stand at the register. Being ""busy"" can be understandable, except for when there's no one else in line and you can't even say ""I'll be with you shortly."" Rather take the extra walk up the street to Simple Pleasures from this point on."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I'm here maybe 3-4 times a week since I can see the place from my house, so I've met basically everyone who works here. All the staff is super nice, I've never had any issues with the service. The breakfast bagels are always stellar and the lattes are perfect."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I really like there blended coffee. I had extra shots added to it it was really good , and I had blta yummy 😋  I forgot to take pictures but it was good"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Stopped in for a coffee and small dessert. The place was inviting but crowded with almost all tables occupied by coffee drinkers and students.  The coffee was good. The pastry was okay. A nice place to visit when you want to get out of the cold.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Excellent find on Google Maps. Thoroughly enjoyable food and coffee in a cozy non-chain setting. Not rushed, but quick service. Better than its rating."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Mediteran & Lax Bagel were soooooooooo good! Such great value for money!! Also the atmosphere is really cozy :-)
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Service staff was surprisingly rude. I ordered a sandwich and my wife ordered a smoothie. The staff member who was taking our order was clearly annoyed that my wife asked for her smoothie to be made using oat milk instead of fruit juice. When my sandwich order was ready after ten minutes or so, I discovered ingredients on the sandwich that weren’t listed anywhere on the menu. I asked the staff member that took our order if I could have the sandwich remade. After a back and forth with the staff member who, again, was not remotely trying to hide how annoyed she was, she begrudgingly took the sandwich. The sandwich came back to me still not made the way the menu board displayed. My wife loved her smoothie. And the sandwich was ok. Overall the food is good, but you won’t know what you’re getting on the items you order because they don’t list all of the ingredients on the menu, and service staff needs remediation on the basics of customer service. Disappointed that I gave them a 20% tip at time of order."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"The atmosphere is cozy and nice, but they always forget to make your order if you order online."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Don’t miss this unique local cafe.  One of the best places to work/read a book in SF.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Reasonably-priced sandwiches. I enjoyed my pastrami and swiss and my wife liked her veggie one. attractive interior, lots of laptop warriors hogging all the tables and a few hobos. single toilet was clean enough."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Outer Richmond, despite the relatively recent influx of hipsters and tech-bros, has surprisingly few cafés and even fewer good ones. So this half-hippy, half-uni student hangout is a standout. The coffee is dark, the staff friendly, and the breakfast/lunch items hearty."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Disappointed by the anti-choice messaging in the window (No on Prop 1.) Won’t be patronizing any more.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I was told that today there was going to be a meeting with the chief of police  what a let down had a group of friends and the place is closed , But on another note I really do enjoy this place every one is very friendly and very knowledgeable . I would always go back"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Stopped in for lunch at this super cute cafe. A few people sitting around at tables eating, drinking coffee, reading, etc. We decided to try sandwiches.  Two gals working behind the counter were very nice, but could have used help on how to properly prepare food.   I would not order food again. A coffee, perhaps. It was a great spot, I wish it had been a better experience."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Arrived here on a Saturday afternoon. Order a latte and a cookie, staff were nice and the latte well-prepared. I tipped them a buck. Went to sit down. Literally after not even 30 seconds, the counterstaff then said: ""We're closed at 5!"" and then immediately shut off all the lights and told us all to leave. Uh, thanks. Maybe you could have told me you were closing BEFORE I ordered and paid for your product? Or simply say, ""To Go orders only"". Imagine going to a restaurant, getting your meal, and then immediately being kicked out before you can even eat it? Or ordering your beer at bar, paying, and then being told they were closed? Very discourteous- I won't be coming back..."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"One of my favorite coffee shops! It’s spacious, feels super cozy with a bookshelf in the back, people are friendly, and their drinks and food is delicious!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Great coffee shop to chill and work. Nice quiet alcoves and private tables. Nice coffee and amazing sandwiches.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,This place is awesome with oodles of atmosphere. Great place to relax and sip your hot drink maybe get some work done. Fav by far in the whole bay!! Way to go!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,If I could give a zero I would. The pastries were uncooked and the vouches were brown. The owner called me racial slurs and was very hostile and aggressive towards me after I asked if I could get my Croissant reheated. I’m still in shock at the utter disrespect of this owner. Not a safe space for people of color.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Excellent customer service and pretty good coffee and food. What they have in Spades is the dining area. It's spacious with a warm atmosphere and a relaxed comfortable lighting. Definitely a great place to go with friends or even alone for a while.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"My favorite neighborhood coffee shop! The staff is always very accommodating and never gives me attitude like the place a few blocks away. A great menu for drinks and food. All of the employees are friendly and quick to say hello. I'm happy they are open inside now, too!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Very cute cafe, nice employees, food came out within a good time frame and was tasty! Would recommend for a quick meal and coffee to go."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  I ordered the Balboa, just as it is offered.  My wife and daughter both loved their orders too.  We will be back."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Nice neighborhood place for coffee and food, any time of day or night. (Former Zephyr Cafe) Great Richmond District location."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,I love it so much
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Good food and drink options for breakfast or lunch.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,The atmosphere and the food are simply fantastic. Definitely worth the visit for breakfast if you're in the area!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Cosy place to have breakfast or just a coffee! The bagels are so good for a decent price!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Super cute setting with delicious sandwiches. We came for a Saturday lunch and it wasn’t crowded.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great place for a mid-morning coffee and breakfast sandwich. Always freshly-prepared. Nice place to get some work or reading done. Tables of different shapes and sizes available for working on your laptop or meeting with colleagues. Parking on the street can sometimes be tricky, but never a problem with little patience. Accept most credit cards."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,I stumbled upon this cafe on a walk and I'm so happy that I did! It was very spacious inside and very cute. I got a sandwich and an iced coffee and both were delicious! I will be back in the future!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Awesome small place! Great cappuccino and delicious fresh sandwiches. Greens tasted like they were picked from the garden 5 minutes ago. Stop by for a quick bite if you are in the area!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Had a great salmon specialty sandwich, a large mango smoothie, and a coffee, then picked out a great book from their library to read while I waited for my great food and ate it. The people were chill, the staff wad friendly, the place is pretty big and there is lots of seating areas. About 60% of the people seated were on their laptops studying or working."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"In a city filled with mediocre $24 burgers, La Promenade Cafe has delicious ~$7 sandwiches. I moved to the neighborhood a few months ago and this spot has become my go-to for coffee/lunch. Amazing food/staff/price, what's not to like?  This review was a long time coming, excited to see what it's like to come in and sit down post-COIVD."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Came here on a chilly late October morning to have some coffee, breakfast, and to get some work done. It's a cozy place, with a warm and inviting atmosphere and friendly staff. Quiet, with plenty of seating and outlets throughout in case you need to plug in. There's even a small bookstore in the back. My coffee was fine, and the mediterranean bagel (avocado, tomato, cream cheese) was good. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in the area."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Great coffee and friendly service. Their PSL definitely hits the spot.  For food I love the Big E or breakfast croissant.  Prices are very reasonable here and even when there's a line it moves quickly.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Wonderful and quirky neighborhood spot! Decent coffee and great selection of sandwiches. A great place to stop if the line at Devil’s Teeth is long
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"One of the most beautiful cafes I have ever been to. Sort of Harry Potter style with old style furniture, book shelves, it is spacious but cozy with lots of tables. Sandwiches were OK, latter was delicious."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"My favorite coffee shop in the whole city! They have really tasty food and drinks - in my opinion, the best pecan pie in the world. It’s like one of those places that you get in and forget about where you are. Very comfortable, with sofas, chairs, tables, free WiFi and plugs for chargers. Somewhat romantic. Just beware of parking on weekdays: 2h limit park-meters."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Very nice place for lunch with an open and eclectic atmosphere. Sandwiches and soups were great!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I love the vibe of this cafe.  Walking in, I was greeted warmly.  I ordered a hot Thai tea and one of their sandwiches.  I seated myself near the books.  I thought it was pretty cool that books are sold here and that they're all $5.  The space itself is spacious.  I like how the cafe is divided.  It seems like the back area is for those who need quiet, like students, and the front area is for social gatherings.  The sandwich was pretty good, and my tea was delicious.  I wish I ordered a small instead of a medium because it was actually quite large for me.  I'm not really in this area, but if I was waiting for a movie to start, I'd wait here before going to the Balboa across the street."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Quite spacious with a friendly, hard working staff, unfortunately with a bit too much turnover. Convenient location and open late, across the street from the Balboa Theater. If you're lucky, you might also catch some live music on weekends. So why only 3 stars? The coffee is really mediocre at best, a fatal flaw for a coffee shop and the high staff turnover suggests management issues."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"One of my favorite cafés in The City, especially when I'm in the Richmond District. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, mellow (ideal for studying, appropriate for families, etc) background music, family friendly & student friendly atmosphere. Appealing to all ages, locals & tourists."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Staff was pleasant and friendly. I had the hummus bagel sandwich which was quite good. I also had a white mocha which tasted just how I remembered it when it was the Zephyr's.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,I come here religiously to catch up on work outside of work. There's plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood. It's a safe area for your car as well -- Richmond district. There has been a slight increase in price (a few cents) but not enough to deter me. The coffee is great! You'll notice a lot of friendly regulars as well.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great local coffee shop. Fantastic space, great staff, wish they would upgrade their coffee blend. Super reasonable prices on food and drink. I avoid open mic and poetry slam nights but the it's great earlier in the day."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Awesome little cafe good amount of seating and quick service. Their breakfast bagels are pretty good too.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Yummy breakfast, great coffee (and I'm a snob from Seattle) and good prices. Also the atmosphere is lovely. I would give it a 5 but there were a bunch of flies in the shop the first day I visited there. Didn't bother me enough not to go back the next day."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Great space to work! Free wifi and lots of space to set up laptop and books. Great priced drinks with huge range of teas. Can sit for hours in there undisturbed. Service is friendly and fast. Takes card and cash!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"I wasn’t here for six weeks, and the cashier didn’t remember whether I took my coffee black or with room. But she tried! That’s better than almost any SF cafe I’ve visited.  Add dark roast coffee beans, a bookshelf to browse, and the college atmosphere, and you’ve got a better “third place” in SF than any Starbucks or Peet’s."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great place for coffee, tasty bites and studying/working"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"La Promenade is seriously my favorite café in the whole city! Even now that I've moved out of that neighborhood, I still specially make trips just to go there even though there's dozens of cafes much closer to my house. All the staff are so friendly and kind, the food is delicious and affordable, and the atmosphere is so perfectly warm and cozy. There's tons of comfortable seating and power outlets, so it's a perfect place to post up for a few hours to do some work or read & relax. There's tables both big and small so you can come enjoy some time alone, or bring a group with you. There's board games available to play, as well as a wall of books from Green Apple all on sale for only $5. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this café. If you're looking for a friendly place to chill out  and enjoy some great food and coffee, look no further!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Wonderful food and coffee! Had house coffee (little hint, their large size is the size of a wheelbarrow, suggest medium if you want a LARGE coffee), very nice. Also had Mediterranean bagel on everything, YUM! will be hard to order anything else again after trying that! Cafe itself is beautifully done up inside, pleasure having brunch here. Decent enough WiFi for consuming content at 20/1 Mbs."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Stopped in for a coffee and will definitely be back. The coffee was great and there is a cozy place to read or work on a laptop just past the counter. Love the vibes of this place.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"There are a lot of coffee shops in San Francisco,  but La Promenade is really a stand out. Unlike most cafes the City there's room to spread out. Plenty of places to sit, read, chat or do a little work. The place isn't cramped, there are great spaces for sitting with friends and catching up as well as opening up a laptop. Inside it's like no other shop in town, and if you have nothing read,  they sell used books from The Green Apple Book Store. As far as the coffee and eats go, perfectly serviceable. It's a coffee shop definitely worth checking out."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Local coffee spot with an interesting interior and a nice community feel. Be sure to check out their bookshelf if you're into literature and if you're hungry order a sandwich at the counter! they are quite good. Would come again. free wifi
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great place to hang out and to work. Cheerful staff. Good coffee and food. Lots of tables and outlets. Fast wifi.  Quiet, peaceful vibe. The Parisian decor is extremely well done and it works. It's a pleasant 15 minute walk through a quiet neighborhood from Fort Miley VA hospital."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This place has an amazing atmosphere and lounge areas. I would definitely come to hang out and relax. Games and books are available for consumption as well as good food at good prices. I was not impressed with the coffee but I'm not a coffee guy, so it may be a biased opinion."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"A friendly staff, a decent lunch menu and a charming interior design adds up to a lovely experience. So whether you just want to read a book in a booth or grab a cup to go this is a great place."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"The cafe is separated into a front end with smaller tables and a larger back area with lots of seating and used books for sale.  The coffee is good, the cups are big and still more affordable than Starbucks."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great study spot.. lots of tables and chairs. Picturesque interior with a wall-size bookshelf (with books for sale  at $5/) in the back. They offer simple but tasty food items, and the coffee isn't bad (not a huge concern for me)."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Lots of space, good wifi. Iced tea is nice and sandwich prices look very reasonable. Great place to work if you can snag one of the numerous outlets."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Only stopped over to get a quick bite, the place was much larger than I expected, and had a great vibe. The coffee was good, but the sandwiches we had were even better. Tried both the Balboa and the BLTA, and both hit the spot. The BLTA was a little on the greasy side, but totally fine."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great breakfast sandwiches, Allegro coffee and more seating than you would believe could exist in an SF coffee shop. Combine with a friendly staff, a Green Apple stocked book section and free wifi and you have one of the best cafes in SF."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Spacious cafe for coffee/sandwich/smoothies/etc, with plenty of tables for sitting, chatting, reading, working on a laptop (decent free wifi). Various sandwich options, but take note: they usually run out of soup early. Stays open later (10pm) than most coffee shops, which is convenient if you want to drop in before going to a movie across the street at the Balboa theater. (Quite a few other restaurants on this stretch of Balboa to choose from, as well.) Pleasant vibe. And maybe if you’re lucky you can even find parking in a 3 block radius; but the bus goes right past the cafe, too."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This is a fine place to go and have a coffee, an overpriced breakfast sandwich, and then to stay a while to compensate for how much you just spent. They have bowl sized coffees, which goes to help offset the cost. If you’re in the area need coffee, this isn’t a bad option."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"A large cafe, largely populated by students and locals. Decorated in a set of clever ""Parisian cafe"" motifs and wall-sized murals, they serve coffee drinks, a wide variety of sandwiches, and desserts. None of these are extraordinary or surprisingly original, but none disappoint either."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Excellent place to go get some work done during the week, comfortable seating with great sandwich pastry and drink selection . On weekends they have board games in the back and occasionally music nights. Highly recommend a stop here if you are in Richmond"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Delicious American Breakfast and chai vainilla.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Mostly quiet place to work/study. Some group of ppl can't read ""the air"".  Wifi is slow. really cute place but if you get that white girl on cashier, watch out.  When she's busy, she's scarrrryyyyyyyyyyy.  Not the greatest when you wana sit and chill and focus to study.  Sandwiches are decent.  Power outlets are only on the walls. The whole back wall is book shelf.  Booths are so cute!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Tons of table space, very reasonable prices, always great service.  The Balboa sandwich is super filling and delicious, and the coffee is always drinkable and decent, not the overpowering artisanal stuff"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"It's a big place, but it feels small and cozy. The Danish was the best I've ever had. The breakfast sandwich was great!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Good coffee and wifi as a baseline, but just a cozy, spacious, bookshelf-lined space that feels like the best of an SF we want to preserve. Eats as well as drinks."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Reliable spot for getting work done. Tons of tables to sit at, and I like the elevated booths when they're free. It's fairly quiet since most are working. Also get sandwiches and drinks here."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Reasonable prices and tons of seating at both down-to-business tables and very lazy, squishy couches. I love this place but I also took away 1 star because their coffee is basically sad brown water."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This cafe is adorable. Great study spot! But also, not too auiet—you can easily meet a friend here and feel comfortable talking with them."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Great little coffee spot. Breakfast sandwich was tasty.  I dig the back area with the couches and library area. Good place to chill.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Head here most mornings for a cappuccino and pastry. Always great coffee, kind staff and fair prices. Food is killer for lunch, too!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,One of my most favorite cafes in the city. Not your ordinary café! Their food and coffee is actually really good and they have this old school feel.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great neighborhood cafe that is unusually spacious for SF. La Prom has great drinks & sandwiches, free WiFi, and plenty of space to work."
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Great decor and environment that makes you feel like you are in a coffee shop/library hybrid. Nice place to study. Both coffee and cookies are yummy.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Cinnamon Chai is so delicious. Love this spot. They've got a Green Apple Books outlet in the back! (They sell food here, so no outside food allowed.)"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,My first time today....recommended by word of mouth from a local.  I chose the egg salad on Rye... It was toasted to perfection.  Great ambiance and excellent customer service.....nice job Annie!!!
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"Great food, great music, good vibes"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"This is the cutest place. Perfect for doing homework, catching up with a friend, or just relaxing. Parking was very easy to find as well. I would definitely recommend coming here!"
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,Decent but unremarkable coffee and food.  Service often spotty and indifferent.  Best feature is the comfortable and roomy dining area.
La Promenade Café,3643 Balboa St,"It's a quiet little café with its own unique style. I love their vanilla chai latte. Great place to meet clients, get your work done."
