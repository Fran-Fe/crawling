Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Sooo good! I got a veggie bagel and it was amazing. The cups are so cute, as the whole store. Would recommend and visit again.  **EDIT: I loved the cozy atmosphere they had. The cute cups and painted walls added a lot of character and made the place special. Now they changed the walls and cups to plain white. Tbh now it's just a regular coffee shop. Ok food and service, but not cozy or special anymore. The smoothies are pure sugar, doesn't seem to be real fruit anymore. I'm sorry they did this, bc now it's not worth it.  You can see some before and after pictures I took of the place."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"A clean, cute cafe for working from home—we had the latte and the matcha latte and both were tasty and larger than expected (especially in comparison to some other coffee shops in SF)."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Their blueberry muffin was amazing! Warm, tender and not too sweet. Just perfect."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I really love this place. It’s become my favorite place to get coffee in my neighborhood. The only exception is on the weekends. The barista on the weekend just makes every coffee taste like a water downed latte. It’s a huge bummer because their specialty coffees are super delicious. It seems like maybe on the weekend it’s just a family thing, but on the weekdays the barista who works there is amazing. Super talented. I finally went on enough weekends to realize so I’m just not gonna get a good cup of coffee there so now I stick to the weekdays. The food is super delicious, it’s definitely a place to sit for a while and enjoy the pastry and delicious coffee."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"So they are a bit slow on the service side, but the latte is delightful."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed the coffee shop. The atmosphere of the cafe is really great, I felt like I was in Paris. Music, ambiance, coffees and dessert were amazing."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Used to be 5 stars. Loved the chicken sandwiches, the wall decorations, and the 8pm closing time. Those 3 things no longer exist as of beginning of 2023 and I need to find a new place to get work done after the gym.  Service and coffee is fine. But I probably won't return and I used to go daily!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Great place quick breakfasts and dessert. Very polite and lovely servers. You need to try croissants and waffles. And usually i use here for studying as well.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I ordered the breakfast bagel with an iced latte and it was the most bland, tasteless meal I have eaten in a while. It was honestly gross. Absolutely zero flavor, the cheese was still cold on the bagel. I ended up leaving after one bite. The latte was equally as bland."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Best latte I've had in San Francisco!  The pastries were just as good.  I will definitely come again
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Best local coffee shop in SF. Great espresso coffee and they always have a special filtered coffee of the month. Sandwiches and pastries are incredible too.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Royal Ground Coffee has the best coffee in the world. These traditional mugs are really amazing. You should definitely try it.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I tried a matcha latte with almond milk. $1 for alt milk is a bit steep. Overall the matcha was fine. Better than matchas I have had other places, but felt weak (heavier on the milk) and lacking in that grassy matcha flavor."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Neighborhood coffee shop with quirky chairs and tables.  Good breakfast choices (various tartines), their execution is ok. Seems like a good place to work, good wifi, though they close quite early."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Nice spot! The food and coffee was so good. Service is very accomodating. Would definitely come back!
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Delicious espresso. Great place for a slow morning cup of coffee. And kind staff!
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Love the vibe at Royal Ground Coffee! Great for getting some work done along side a matcha latte and a chocolate chip cookie
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Cozy, cute and nice place with most delicious salmon toast!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Prob one of the best cups of coffee and pastries had in Sf in a warm inviting environment... Apparently baker is Michelin rated..only had the apple galette and it was yummy!
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"One of my best experience with coffee shop. Sweet ambience, great coffee, nice breakfast and brunch options. And a great high quality coffee beans to buy"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Delicious food and drinks! Highly recommend. The atmosphere was chill to also get some work done as well.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Best matcha latte in the city! You should try the lavender matcha, it’s amazing! Very friendly staff. Great and chill ambiance!"

Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"This is a great coffee shop. Staff is always polite and welcoming, great coffee and tasty food. And customers who are coming there everyday are very interesting and talented, if you come there youll 100% meet someone outstanding to chat with!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Cute little corner coffee shop with a lot of charm. I got the cracked pepper turkey sandwich on soft roll, bag of chips and a Thai iced tea. The sandwich was delicious. The service was incredibly fast."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Very cute, little and cozy cafe tucked in Polk street along many other coffee shops around but this one really manages to stand out. Love the seating, vibe and the light music that plays in the background. Wonderful place to enjoy a bagel which seems to be always fresh and also, they serve their coffee in wonderful, colorful ceramic mugs which is a huge plus and makes it an enjoyable experience. The people serving especially the woman is so friendly and warm in welcoming and serving the order always - she makes sure to take the order right and serve in the mugs whenever it is ordered for there."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"This is a diamond in the rough on it’s way to becoming a gem; Sit outside to read the paper and drink their coffee served in large, colorful mugs ;  interior design is a bit shambolic and dimly lit but in a curious manner , it does bring patrons and the neighborhood together  ; the superb jazz soundtrack this morning was mostly Miles Davis and John Coltrane!  Their coffee is quite fine ; I am more into the atmosphere within a cafe because I can’t really distinguish between coffee beans. And their atmosphere is most welcome on Polk Street."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Cute place with nice breakfast menu and some fun chairs outside. The poor employee at the counter was the cashier, barista, and chef all at the same time…get him some help."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"The BEST service, guy literally gets fresh bagels every morning for you, and is always accommodating, smiling and super friendly vibe. A few tables outside so you don't have to fight over one table. Thank you so much for making our stay in SF amazing every morning with your homey delicious coffee and food!!!!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Friendly and warm neighborhood coffee shop. Dennis, the owner, is super cordial and is always happy to help. I specially love sitting in the little corner by the window. Outdoor seating is nice too, when the sun is out. Highly recommend it :)"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,I had the best cheesecake of my life here! The cheesecake was so FRESH and tasted MAGICAL!! He offered it to me with strawberry jam. The jam was warm and at first I was confused but the warm jam with the cold cake was literally GOALS! the jam had very few sugar particles in it that gave this AMAZING texture. This cheesecake was a transformational experience for me. I recommend it to EVERYONE
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,So disappointed in the redesign. I love their coffee and breakfast but it was so cute and cozy and now it’s cold and uninviting. 5 stars for coffee & food but -1 since the redesign.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"A welcoming place with really friendly and kind staff. Moreover, the empanadas are great!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Maybe it was the barista's first day on the job, maybe he doesn't know how to make single-shot espresso drinks, or I don't know what. But the latte was overly hot, watery, and tasteless."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Sebastian the barista is super friendly and the coffee is delicious! The sandwiches look great too
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Cozy local coffee shop with small bites. I had the breakfast bagel and triple cappuccino , both were reasonably priced and tasted amazing !!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"The largest mocha comes with 3 espresso shots and tastes very good. Service was pretty quick, but too busy inside for my preference."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Definitely a locals spot, the coffee was great, honey cake was delicious, the sandwich had freshly baked bread and the size for the cost 👌🏽. We will be back. …"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Amazing coffee shop to spend time reading at. The employees were super friendly and welcoming. They also don’t blast annoying and loud music which I was extremely grateful for. Will definitely be coming back here often
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Great coffee. Staff is super sweet. Order a breakfast sandwich - the egg is fluffy and delicious!
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,I’m a regular at the Royal Ground Coffee and will keep coming back for more cappuccino and beef empanadas! Excellent service and atmosphere. Recommend 100%!

Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Friendly service and yummy flat white. Good spot to work from.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I was looking for a business meeting place at a coffee shop and did not want to do it at any starbucks or other chain shops. I am so glad I found the Royal Ground Coffee in San Francisco! This is such a nice place with a warm atmosphere! The place was quite busy, but the owner found a place for us and was very polite and attentive. The coffee is absolutely amazing! They also serve the most amazing Napoleon cake in the world! I will definitely come back and highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to try how real coffee tastes and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I’ve been coming here for years and it’s always a pleasure to visit! Their coffee and food is amazing. I love their sandwiches, so tasty! I would sit here for hours just studying and feeding myself, such an amazing experience for me ❤️"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Delicious coffee. Had two Mocha’s and the owner is so friendly. It has chill coffeehouse music and it’s a nice place to work, have a chat, or just hangout for some time. Highly recommend this over the Starbucks that is on the other side of the street."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Family owned unique coffee shop with scrumptious desserts and snacks! I love that there's outdoor seating and the employees are super nice. It's a nice change in scenery from the chains across the street and they make your coffee quickly if you're in a rush. Love this place. Great atmosphere.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"All the experience here was amazing 😍: the owner, the service, the food and Ofcourse the coffee. Warm, cozy and delicious. …"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Without a doubt this is the best cup of coffee in the Bay area. I started coming here in 1990 and 8 years ago found myself living in the East Bay. I return to San Francisco last week and took the time to go to Royal ground rather than Peet (all the profit from Pete's goes to a German capitalist). Man that was such a good cup of coffee!  It reminded me of the seven years I was stationed overseas in Europe. None of the filter kitty litter that you get at Starbucks 🤢.  So glad they can keep a good product going!
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"A cute atmosphere inside and a friendly barista.  The almond latte was bitter compared to my preferences.  They offer a conservative yet diverse array of pastry foods.  I would try them again, yet with so many other great coffee choices nearby I call this a ""swing and a miss."""
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I love this place, primarily for its hours. Sadly, a lot of coffee shops in SF don't feel particularly conducive to multi-hour study. Royal Ground Coffee is the exception. It is quite easy to find a table and work away, with wifi and outlets abound (despite the small space). It is also open until 8pm, which is quite late by SF's standards. The staff are also quite friendly."
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Good coffee (double espresso) but would have preferred to have it not in a paper cup, same goes for the English breakfast tea 🍵 …"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Great coffee place. Best latte in town. I hope they will start doing deliveries online instead of just shutting down. I hear many websites like postmates and uber eats are offering much lower fees
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,The Best Espresso makes the Best Cappuccino! Lucky my friend who lives down Polk took me here. Years ago! Great Pastries and croissants! The cup I want to sip in heaven
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Delicious coffee. Almond milk available upon request. Simple menu. Quick service. Outside seating so you can soak in the sun on an otherwise chilly morning. If I'm in the area I will definitely return.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,It's a small local coffee shop with free wifi. It's a nice place to get some work done if you don't feel like dealing with the people over at Starbucks. Definitely seems like a Russian Hill local spot. Nothing fancy. Doesn't seem too packed and you can usually find a seat.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"I used to love the vibe of this place, and how late it was open under the previous owners. The space very different now, and the coffee is really bad. Also today I got a massive rash on the back of my leg after sitting in one of the seats (the really tall one near the window on the left side). Love this place 4 years ago, but not so much now :("
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Love this place and their coffee beans. I usually order it when I travel, and bring to my friends all over the world. They all love it too!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Delicious coffee. All the pastries were amazing. New favourite spot on the block.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Such a great little place. The coffee was so good and strong. The breakfast sandwich was delicious! It wasn't busy which was nice since I hadn't had coffee yet
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Good place except for all the selfish nitwits who use the place as their office. Before the pandemic, space wasn’t a problem. Now it is. Learn some courtesy morons"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Great coffee, superb bagels. Very cozy interior Power outlets and free Wi-Fi"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"It´s the best coffee shop in the whole area to enjoy a good cup of coffee and relax or work. Was there 2 years ago  during a one week stay in SF and stopped by every day ( just dicovered it  again on Google Maps and good memories came up again). Greetings from South of Germany to the Russian guy and his girl, hope they still run the place. Uli  Add: Not so easy to drop by and have a cup of your coffee and the new menue when you sit in Germany like me:-). Hope to see you and your spot again. Let´s hope for it. Many greetings, Uli"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Best coffee i had in san francisco! Great blend, cozy atmosphere and friendly service! If you know what good coffee is and you want to support the locals and not starbucks go here!"
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,Nice basic coffee shop. The owner is wonderful and keeps me coming back. Best breakfast bagels in the neighborhood and good strong coffee.
Royal Ground Coffee,2216 Polk St,"Royal Ground House Coffee closed because the owners Victoria Kim and Dennis are both doing business without paying their vendor and supplier. Their espresso, brewers and other equipments are seized back by their vendor on Sunday 10/18/2020 morning for failure to pay since pre-Covid Jan 2020. Even after they re-open their business in summer, they still failed to pay and took advantage of their supplier until as recent as October. Do not shop, do any business, nor support this business as they are under pending litigation. For more information, email Tentera Coffee Roasters Corporation."
