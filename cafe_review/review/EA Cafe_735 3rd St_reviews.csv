EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"They sell amazing poke bowls to taste. After eating one you're already planning your next return,  which has been the same day for me. I ordered thesame thing, 6 hours apart, yet the bowls were soooo different.  The second bowl was lacking ingredients and overall disappointing compared to the phenomenal bowl they made earlier.   If the first one wasn't so good I wouldn't be so disappointed with the second one. I really do recommend them. I  just would not eat there twice in same day so you don't ruin it for yourself like I did. Picture is the first bowl they made. I didn't bother taking a picture of the second because it doesn't do them justice."
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"I wish the poke bowls had more fish, doesn’t seem like nearly enough. I don’t understand the prices either as a large that comes with 3 types of fish and avocado is the same price as a regular with only 2 types of fish but add avocado - next time I would get the large if I’m paying the same. Also thai tea was good but a little too sweet! Overall really cute and small space. Will be back!"
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"It's easy to miss from the street, but it's a pleasant, well-decorated space as soon as you walk in, and you'll be welcomed enthusiastically and genuinely! They've also got a great assortment of canned and bottled beverages beyond their own offerings (:"
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"Small unassuming shop next to the hotel I was staying at. I ordered a custom poke bowl, marking my selections on a dry erase menu. The lady was very pleasant and quick to thank me for coming in. I would definitely come back if I am back in town again."
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,My wife and I eat here all the time!  We've their poki bowls and also their soft serve ice cream is soooo good.  We get the matcha sundae and it has toasted almond slivers and matcha on it and it's so so good.  It's constantly one of our favorite spots in the city!
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"It’s really good. But it’s not The best soft serve you’ll ever have. It’s definitely really good, because the place looks like a hole in the wall. It really doesn’t look like it should be all that good. But I tried to cookies and cream soft serve, and it was really tasty. But it wasn’t fully consistent. The top is really yummy with lots of cookie crumble, but I have to eat through that it’s about half of it is just soft serve no extra goodies. So definitely better than it looks on the outside."
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"Just reopened. Very polite and very good poké. I got a mango and pineapple slushy the other day. Today I got poké, boba, and soft serve. Can't wait to get a chocolate croissant tomorrow. Just go and you'll understand why I go here almost every day, even the person in line behind me said ""this is my new favorite place"" when looking at the various stuff this store had to offer."
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"The sign on the counter says, ""the best soft serve ice cream.""  Indeed, it's the best soft ice cream I've had in the SF bay area (I've tried them all).  It's at the same level as east coast frozen custard -- good value, too."
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,5 Stars just for the Bento itself quantity may not be great for those that wants to get a filled bellt but wow the quality in visual and taste is freaking amazing if this is how it taste here in this Cafe I can only imagine how Unbelievable tasty it would be to have this bento in Japan made with their fresh ingredients wow 👨‍🍳 👩‍🍳 💋

EA Cafe,735 3rd St,Nice Black milk tea boba. Good proportions between milk/tea/ice/sugar. Quick and nice service
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"I’ve been passing by the place since Covid and noticed it was open today, so I stopped in and was in awe how quaint and reasonable the prices were for SF. It felt like I was stepping into a small food shop in Berkeley! I got black milk tea with boba, and my boyfriend got a strawberry slushee ( his was stuffed full of slushee before I took the photo) I will definitely come back again!🥰"

EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"This place is worth stopping by at least once to get the soft serve! I would like to try the whole menu. So far I’ve had the coffee, the san pelegrino, the hot chicken bowl, and the matcha soft serve. Everything was good and the price was “San Francisco” but not “SAN FRANCISCO!?!?! I CAN’T AFFORD THESE $5 CHIPS”"
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"Super nice cafe with lots of options for coffee, soft serve, snacks and dinner take aways. The best part is the owner, Enni is super friendly and one of the best people you will get to meet ever! 😃 …"
EA Cafe,735 3rd St,"Really good food, but beware that they are randomly closed sometimes. I am standing outside of this place right now at 4:30pm on a Tuesday and they are closed. I will edit my review if they can keep their posted hours, or adjust them so they reflect when they are actually open. Edit: updated to 5 stars since it was a one-time thing, will update back down to 1 star if it keeps happening."
