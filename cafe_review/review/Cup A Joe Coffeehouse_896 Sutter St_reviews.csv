Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I had past this spot many times but once I went in I was pleasantly surprised with the coffee quality. To my understanding they use intelligentsia coffee beans which the espresso shots are packed with flavor. They have a tart note that I really love.  I’ve only tried the coffee so this rating is for that, not the food. But I can say that the espresso over ice here is spectacular.  The staff have always been welcoming and the lively music is a great touch. I’d strongly suggest getting a coffee here, sitting either inside or outside and vibe out."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Lots of glass windows, so this is a bright little coffee place.  The hot chocolate was really good. The sausage breakfast sandwich was good, but for me, it was missing something… maybe more seasoning in the sausage patty.  But I wouldn’t mind visiting again to try something else off their breakfast menu."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Adorable and cute coffee shop. Really loved the vibe in here. The coffee was very delicious. Haven't tried the food yet. Good place for work or just hang out
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I had a caramel Americano with cream the first day we were in San Francisco. It was delicious. We tried several other coffee shops around the area, but in the last day, decided to to back because it was the best. The croissant breakfast sandwich was good also."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I loved the vibe of this place, there was a very chill dog hanging out inside. Not sure if the dog is a regular in the shop but he really made it special. Some of the best coffee we had in town while visiting. The foam on my latte and my husbands cappuccino was impressive."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Breakfast bagel-sandwhich was very good and filling. I got an iced white mocha and it was good but a bit milky— so get an extra shot if you want stronger coffee drinks. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and it’s dog friendly with a water bowl for your furry friend as well!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"This place has a very nice, open interior. It’s a great place to study or get work done. It has high wood tables and there’s plenty of light from the glass walls. They also have outdoor seating which is made more enjoyable by the hilly environment. You can get some morning sun too.  Coffee good. I get cappuccinos here regularly and am never disappointed. They have pastries and sandwiches. Their breakfast sandwiches are good, and they have options for <$10.  They see dog friendly, staff are welcoming, and their restroom is wheelchair (ADA) accessible, singly occupancy, and all gender/gender-neutral."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I like the vibe of this cafe. I love their playlist, the casual atmosphere of the shop, and their coffee is quite decent. A good spot to relax and immerse yourself in conversation or a good book in the afternoon."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"love this open concept little café. pretty basic, no-frills menu. no vegan options that i saw, but a couple vegetarian. there was only one employee running the show, but they were absolutely killing it!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Really cool place with relaxed friendly atmosphere, wifi and great coffee!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Good breakfast, been here twice and both times I got a Bear Claw / Bagel & Cream cheese / and Orange Juice. It was good as hell...  What you guys from up North here would call ""Hella delightful""..."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Lovely spot to hang on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I got tea and relaxed at the large shared tables. A little bit expensive for tea, mind you.  But so it goes. I liked the vibe, people, and big windows opening to the street. A little Pixies on the speakers helped to. ❤️"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Good place to relax in the morning, they make so good drinks and coffee (not a fan of coffee btw) tho it's really expensive it your going to eat here. I spent 40 dollars on 3 sandwiches, not including drinks. Would come here again just to grab a morning matcha drink ;]"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Good breakfast sandwich! Scone was okay. Great service!
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"This place let me do my work for a number of days before I got to move in to my new place. The coffee was good and cheap, the wifi was spotty, but no one heckled me and I didn’t feel like I was ever gonna be asked to buy another thing.  Lots and lots of locals here and their dogs."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,One of our favorite SFO cafes! The Sausage Breakfast Sandwich is almost better than sex (almost). The coffee is always delicious.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Lovely little shop. I can’t remember the guy’s name, but he made the best Americano I’ve ever had in my life! Amazing!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Out of this world breakfast sandwich and delicious coffee! Such a great spot!
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"They have really friendly personale, good breakfast & professional Service ❤️🇲🇦👉SF …"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"A down to earth, neighbourhood coffee shop! Good selection of coffee, teas and snack food! Nice, polite & friendly staff. Its been our breakfast cafe, during our few days away, here in San Francisco! ☕👍 …"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Maybe I was there on a bad day, because the  barista was really put out, when I asked for a spoon, there won’t be any. Millennial eye-roll when I asked her for a glass of tapwater to go with my meal. Coffee is good. You have to beg for Wi-Fi password. The food is a little pricey. Not bad, but not great either."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"A bit pricey for the quality and ambiance. Very average breakfast and coffee.  However, I love it for a low-key happy hour and (limited) outdoor seating"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"It's close to st. Francis Hospital The coffee is Intelligentsia coffee it's from Seattle I believe .it's good ,very good It has  big house Cabernet and Zinfandel  Friendly staff and good breakfast sandwiches"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Paid $5 something for an ice chai that has zero chai in there. Just a plain milk. Absolutely ridiculous and the barista is not friendly even tipping $1. Won’t be coming back
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Great breakfast sandwiches and their latte coffee's are awesome as well!
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Visiting from Utah and found this coffee house here! Guys! Come check it out! Great service, great morning food, and overall GREAT COFFEE! 5 outta 5"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,I hate iced matcha lattes. I just dislike the taste of matcha. but I’m also stubborn and refuse to dislike a food/ drink so I will repeatedly order them to become accustomed to the flavor. my God. this place made the best iced matcha lattes I’ve ever had. they made me a believer. I’m not from San Fran but when I come here for work I will always stop by in the mornings for one. thank you cup of joe.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,There is an amazing Caffeehouse and nice people
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Friendly and compassionate staff, power for my laptop, great coffee and food, and comfortable indoor and outdoor seating make this place my #1 go-to.  I love it!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Wonderful staff and great owner!  I wish they had more vegan food options but have recently started doing pop ups with local baker L.H.Bakeshop!  The espresso drinks are great with all the good plant milk options.  I get my lattes from here everyday.  2nd shoutout to the wonderful amazing and kind staff.  They have a great team and the owner is so cool with encouraging local artists to put up art there.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I'm moving out of my apartment down the street next week, and this is the business I am most sad to leave behind.  It's pleasant, quick, and has good pastries and espresso. I especially like sitting outside in the morning."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Pros: Great playlist, large open windows for people watching, and good beers on tap.  Cons: The coffee is just.. not very good. Tried to give them the benefit of the doubt at first, but it's pretty consistently flavorless. Just come here for beers and the environment instead."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,I ask the cashier twice if it was fresh squeeze OJ and he said yes with a bad attitude. I just got home and start drinking this completely artificial juice! Totally scam !
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Food is delicious and service was great! I suggest the Croque-Madame!
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,The employees & owner are great. Lively atmosphere of regulars & locals. I've been in town for 4 days & drank coffee here every morning. *Breakfast sandwich with sourdough is tasty.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,They have a great coffee and great people...
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Cup A Joe is my go to neighborhood cafe. Coffee on the way to work? Beer and a book on the way home? Large, unhealthy breakfast sandwiches when I wake up hungover on the weekend? Check, check, check!  Want to pay $6 for a latte with a heart drawn in the foam? Looking for a biography of the Central American farmers who produced your cup of single-origin, small-batch, lovingly-handcrafted, pour-over coffee? This is not your place!  But if you want a relaxed, comfortable hangout to meet up with friends, read a book, or watch people go by, Cup A Joe is a great spot. Chill atmosphere, nice staff, good music, decent if unexceptional drinks, and not packed to the gills with laptop zombies all day - this place nails the ""urban neighborhood cafe"" atmosphere."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"As a new local and neighbor at the time, my roommate introduced me to Cup A Joe literally across the street. And, what could be more fun and convenient is this local coffee cafe/hangout, my new place to call home away from home. Of course being popular to locals like myself, and amongst the energy of city life, you can still find refuge wether you prefer sitting inside or outside, or take your tasty aromatic joe with you. Do your thing here, and enjoy the convenient comforts of soothing and tasty delights. I am lucky to have (what I call now a souvenir) a genuine cup from Cup A Joe that I purchased years ago."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Great coffee. The espresso is delicious. Good food options.  Chill vibe.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Latte was smooth and very drinkable! Pastries a bit on the chewy side and not flaky enough but they're not terrible. Okay option but there are better places a few blocks away.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I really want to give this place 5 stars, just like I want to love it more than I do. The atmosphere is great, the employees are cool, there’s WiFi, beer, food, and outdoor seating. What else can you ask for? The only drawback is, I go here literally every day, and never get hooked up w an occasional free drink. I’m just of the thought that regulars should occasionally get a thank you w a free coffee. It’s also a little on the pricy side. So even though I go here every day, my first thought is, “ugh $5 ice coffee.”"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Stopped here for a quick bite one morning and it was pleasant. The breakfast sandwiches are pre-made and they toast them when you order. Turned out pretty good actually. Beats fast food and the airport food I've been eating while here in SF. Coffee was solid as well.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"This coffee shop has great coffee, a good selection of plant-based milk, delicious bagels, and excellent music.  They need to work on single-use plastics though. A lot of customers drink in the cafe from disposable cups even though they have ceramic mugs available. And some dishes are served with plastic cutlery - time to get metal cutlery for dine-in customers!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I Have been here only twice but already can feel the vitality vibe of this cafe and the neigborhood around it. As a writer, a vital space is very important for me be creative and this place give me that energy. Drinks and foods here are expensive and not that impressive. A good thing is that staff really listen to your order. Vegan/veggie friendly. Excuse me for my bad drawing, I did borther to take a photo because the place was so enjoyable. The drawing is just the projection of me and how I feel about it lol."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,The espresso was weak the food was ok. Lots of outside seating.. had high hopes for this spot but really pretty average.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I enjoyed the coffee and bagel but was off put by the rude barista who used no social skills in asking the person ahead of me to step out of the way. Asking ""can you move"" in a condescending, whiney manner just set a negative tone and not only made that customer feel uncomfortable,  but made me feel that way too."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Terruble 'service' - rude staff, lost at least 3 orders including my coffee while i was there, and then blaming customers and staff argueing amongst each other."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"A respectful, relaxed mixed croud. Fun or work.  I go there dressed up or down and am treated very nice. The staff is friendly and happy. They have delish coffee, as good as starbucks, wifi and in a pinch I work on my computer from there. Students do too. Medium to low noise. Enjoy.."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Great little spot to work from or sit outside in the sun and have a beer. They only have one size coffee mug, regardless of ordering a small medium or large. So just order a small if you want room for cream."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Coffee was great. Scone was fresh. Also loved the seating outside . It was morning time and sunny so perfect place to sip coffee along the side walk.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Yes.  This is the kind of corner coffee shop where you want to hang out.  You can sit there all day on your laptop nursing that $2 coffee.  Good looking people will walk by; folks with piercings and tatoos will sit next to you and scribble in notebooks; you can take an indoors or outdoor table; there’s art.  What else do you slackers want??
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Nice place for a beer or a quick snack. Good atmosphere, with students hanging out, studying or doing their stuff on their pcs. They have good beers, with a very low price during happy hour. Some good panini."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Overall good clean spot with great breakfast sandwiches.. just pricey.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Cutesy little coffeehouse / happy hour place to have some affordable beer in the evening. The breakfast sandwiches are just OK, though, nothing fancy along the lines of Jane or farm:table."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"perfect spot, always great quality drinks & service! welcoming vibe"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Saturday's late afternoon cashier was outstanding! Great Cappuccino💖😉 …
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,A quality shop with nice staff and outdoor seating. Decent selection of food to go with the drinks. Prices are a little more than expected but not terrible.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Really tasty sandwiches and stronger coffee than the average American cup, which is nice. Fantastic decor and just a nice place to sit and enjoy a breakfast."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Cozy,  spacious but could be little crowded when there are tourists.  Overall,  it is a good place to hang out. Internet connection is solid too!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Nice neighborhood cafe, great coffee, good music. Loved their dog. They have plenty of outdoor tables, I liked that."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Great local spot to get espresso and your regular craft beers. Nice view of nob hill neighborhood. Outside seating.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Quaint mixed menu for all day. Good sized breakfast sandwich portions and coffee in ceramics. Beer on tap. Good seating and restroom. Open late.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Good neighborhood coffee house for above average coffee and pastry and snacks.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Great coffee and good breakfast sandwhiches. The staff are not Starbucks friendly but who cares at 6 or 7 in the morning when all you need is good coffee and maybe a good breakfast sandwhich.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Staff was extremely rude, got upset with me for asking for WiFi and when I didn’t see my coffee on the counter practically yelled at me. WiFi was also very weak. A good coffee shop otherwise with good seating and good coffee."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Great place, ok service but coffee is missing one of the most important ingredients..... flavour. Maybe I was just unlucky?"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"My morning wouldn't be the same without Cup-A-Joe - Intelligencia coffee with a breakfast burrito is just the ticket to get things rolling on the way to work. And after a long day, the 9 taps of cold beer know just how to get the evening on track."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I last was in that Cup of Jo Mother's day of 2017, the female cashier was ignoring me. DgS snatched my card out my hand, I did tip. Prior times never had bold rude experience. They deleted my review"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Open until 10pm, this cafe is a great casual spot for everything. Whether it be food, a snack, coffee or drink. Lots of indoor and road side seating. Free wifi too!"

Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Good coffee! Smart, friendly gal serving it. The food looks fresh and tasty. I'll be back regularly!"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Delicious coffee and incredibly chill atmosphere. Was very productive in this space. Free Wi-Fi and power sockets are a big plus.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Friendly neighborhood coffee shop with great food and coffee, as well as beer on tap. What more could a person ask for?"
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,No discounts on coffee refills? Damn it.  Sandwitches are good and heated up properly in an oven not just microwaved.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Delicious white mocha which wasn't too sweet and really quench my coffee craving for the day. I would highly recommend Cup-A-Joe Coffee
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"The owner, Joe, makes an awesome latte. Most of the rest of the staff does too but sometimes when they're busy, the quality slips. very slightly."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,The real secret: you can get awesome beers on tap through the afternoon for $4.95. Post up outside and have a grand old time.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Because of a coner shop it's surrounded by windows which always open and smoke coming from the streets. Pastries are dry and the WiFi is very slow.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Fair prices, lots of options and great staff. Came here almost every morning of my stay in SF. Loved how I was treated and the food."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Wonderful place, a favorite of the Art students and lower Nobhill regulars. My Cafe Americana was just right."

Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Amazing breakfast sandwiches. Probably my favorite in the whole city. The buns they use are just delicious.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Small place. Coffee tastes like garbage. Cappuccino is served in small espresso cups.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Decent cup of Joe.
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Well I had a cup of coffee  here the other day and it was pretty  bad ....Well really  really  bad I thought maybe it was just because I came in mid day so this morning I tried a mocha it was way worse then I thought It even could be the worst I've ever  had it tasted like a re-heated latte with sugar added it had the same after taste coffee has with sugar....maybe just coffee with extra sugar the young girl at the register was nice but it was keeping me out a little to see an older guy behind the counter staring at a young girl  (probably legal but did not appear so) the worst coffee in sf creepy  owner domestic beer what else could one ask for
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,Don't let their awesome drinks distract you from the fact that this is also one of the best breakfast/lunch spots in the neighborhood.

Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"I’m not overly exaggerating, but the best Americano I’ve ever had—perfect consistency and very rich in flavor. Not once. Every single time. Fantastic service."
Cup A Joe Coffeehouse,896 Sutter St,"Not having our hotel breakfast service, we chose this bar the first morning and then also the following ones since we liked it both as a place and as a service. We had tea and brioche and we liked them, but even the savory breakfasts had an inviting air. The guys are very kind and fast in the service."
