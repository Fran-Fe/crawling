Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Very cool and unique spot in SF, you need to see the decoration by yourself to really understand what I mean. I go every Saturday with a group of friends. I usually get the veggie sandwich and is SO good. Fresh ingredients and they make everything in the moment. People working there are very nice. Highly recommend!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Wide tea selection & freshly baked pound bread. The staff were very friendly and I appreciated that they asked about my service dog and any needs I may have. They also mentioned that they would intervene if other dogs coming into the cafe were too aggressive, which I appreciate since I have been kicked out of multiple food establishments because of my service dog existing. It’s in a quieter part of the city and I personally thought the fairy and dog decor was fun. I wish the chairs were a bit more comfortable and it’s a little more cramped (might be hard for wheelchair access), but the bathroom is accessible and I didn’t feel pressured to leave. Will come back again 🙂"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Fantastic mix of options with an eclectic vibe. Had each of the bagel bites and they were all great
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Such a cute little place! With an interesting decoration! Really pet friendly!
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Cozy cafe, friendly baristas, delicious coffee, fresh treats. Perfect for quick fixes or chill hangouts. Highly recommend trying!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"I wanted to love it, but it was just not good. I got a vanilla lavender latte, and it was watery and bitter. I also got an earl grey bread loaf that was dry and bitter as well."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Some of the best coffee in neighborhood. Great casual spot on the go or to study. Karma cafe treats their staff and community with love. Our pup loves to visit
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Excellent vibes with a hip interior and eclectic decor. Love the unique coffee drinks they serve too. Plus it has WiFi!  Wasn’t as impressed with their very expensive but ultimately bland breakfast sandwich. Think I’d save money by sticking to their drinks instead.
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Was really excited to try this coffee shop since it is the closest to my new home! The outside look of the cafe is very inviting, with colorful walls and bubbles flying everywhere! The inside was just as whimsical and the staff was very nice. I got a americano with oatmilk and a breakfast bagel sandwich. The coffee was .... wow way better than expected and honestly the best I have tried in the area so far.  The reason I gave this a three star, is because both the breakfast sandwich bagel egg sausage and greens and the sandwich my boyfriend got the egg muffin sausage was one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had.  The egg yokes were so dry and pasty the avocado’s were not fresh and there was no cheese (it needed it) there was arugula on the bagel and it did not match well with the flavors.  The English muffin breakfast sandwich was horrible in all the same ways but the muffin itself was greasy and had a texture of a cheese puff.  Overall, I will be coming back for the coffee so good!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Always love coming to Karma Cafe for lunch while I wait for my next class. Very friendly people and always have conversations with their customers! Have yet to try more items on the menu, but I love the chicken pesto panini! Even though it might be pricey it is extremely good :)  Chicken pesto panini and Very Berry smoothie are about $18-$19"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Nice corner cafe with a few vegan selections and interesting mix of lattes. Would get more stars if extra was not charged for plant-based milks.
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,It’s the best cafe in the area by far. Really cool decor and vibe on the inside. The staff is excellent. Great coffee and freshly baked in house pastries. Good bagels and sandwich options for lunch. Overall everything I’d ever hope for from a neighborhood cafe.
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Excellent coffee and so many delicious choices for smoothies, breakfast and sandwiches. This place truly lives up to its name.  I go hear to catch a break from work and it is always such a lovely and calming experience!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Lovely environment with great service and great coffee! Outstanding decorations and added Halloween decorations inside and outside. Barista was friendly and did his job well by making an effort to recommend drinks to both my husband and I. My husband loved their breakfast burrito and nutty espresso smoothie. I loved my mocha with cinnamon. But what I loved even more is how the employees treated their customers. I noticed an elderly lady with a walker who sat in a perfect little nook there which looked to be her regular spot. The barista went out of his way to bring her her drink and make sure she was taken care of. Didn't witness a whole lot of kindness on our vacation in San Francisco. So to see it and feel it here was refreshing.
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Karma Cafe is the soul of our neighborhood. The thoughtfully decorated space radiates warmth, solidarity, and inclusion. It’s a feminist fever dream come true. My first visit there was when I reconnected and reconciled with a close friend after a time apart. Karma Cafe is reinvigorating, uplifting, and delicious: I hope you all get a chance to stop by and enjoy it."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Very cool place,  just wish they had much more vegan / plant-based food and pastry options.  There wasn't a vegan cream cheese option for the bagels either.  *vegan Cranberry lemon bread - good"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"I was really excited to go to Karma cafe since I saw a video on envibe app but anyway I went there without big expectations. So the place itself is really nice and cozy, I've had egg muffin sausage which was not the best but also not the worst one )). So once in a while can go there"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,It was a really cute cafe I loved the inside. Although the coffee was pretty expensive I paid around 7 dollars for an iced vanilla latte. The coffee was okay but I expected them to have indoor seating and they didn’t so that was a little disappointing. Friendly staff :)
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,We go here almost every weekend to get smoothies (we live close by). The smoothies are tasty but they just raised prices by $2 per smoothie. I know this is San Francisco but $12 plus tip for a smoothie to go? This may have just motivated me to buy a Vitamix.
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Very quirky cafe with interesting ambience. There is a lot of artwork and decoration along with a whole wall dedicated to dogs who have lost their lives. So far, I've gotten espresso nut smoothie and a cold brew from here, both were great!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Cool atmosphere and yummy drinks. Try the Karma Sunrise - it is like an Arnold Palmer with mango added, and it is delicious!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"I love this place! Their specialty lattes are delicious. I didn't use to buy the pastries here, but I recently discovered the blueberry lemon pastry and wow, it is amazing. The smoothies are also to die for.  I must also give a shout out to the awesome staff here. They're friendly, efficient and clearly care about their work."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Really enjoy this spot!! Lil pricey but highly recommend
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"This place is a vibe for sure! The owner and staff must genuinely believe in Karma because each time I've been there, they've been warm, quick, and delighted to welcome all of their customers. I got the breakfast burrito and it was yummy."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"My wife ordered oatmeal and asked everything to be made with almond milk because she is lactose intolerant. They took 15 min to make it in the microwave and she watched them put whole milk in it. When she asked for them to remake it with almond milk a woman yelled at her from the upstairs that she should have asked for it when she order because it takes 10 minutes to make.  A friend of mine order a breakfast burrito that they made in the microwave and it was so soggy that it was inedible.  I ordered the vegan veggie sandwich which was good because it was the only thing they didn’t make in the microwave.  Wait times are too long, the food is sub par and the staff is rude. We will not be coming back. The decorations are pretty quirky tho."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"The atmosphere was bright, entertaining and spotless. The dog wall of fame was priceless! I arrived about 20mins to closing and Alex was kind to offer what was available. My sandwich was extremely tasty and all produce seemed fresh. I would absolutely recommend coming here."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"BAD KARMA My first visit to this place shows the staff to have weak customer service skills. And no ability to provide good customer service for a negative experience like a bitter lemonade or a tasteless rubbery breakfast quiche.  Lavender Lemonade tastes like potpourri  - like chemicals. The girl at the counter said they order the lavender from Amazon. I think they aren't using food grade lavender. And its probably dried for crafts.  I picked out a bacon quiche that looked like a little muffin.  Cute behind glass, but it was so rubbery it was gross. I think they microwaved it. I started to bite into it and it was so stiff I decided to tear it in half.  The bacon was gray, it didn't taste like bacon and there was some mushy veggies and bellpeppers in it. I tasted it, spit it out and threw it away - Gordon Ramsey style.  It should have been described as a Bacon Vegetable quiche, not a ""Bacon quiche""  So much wrong with just these two items. They even got my green tea wrong. How could they put the teabag in the hot tea without pulling the paper tab outside of the cup?  They steeped the teabag with the paper tab in the hot water. That is such an amateur thing, it's as if the staff don't know how to brew a TEA BAG!  There are so many other places to eat at, I just won't go back to this place. And I won't recommend it either.  The only thing it has going for it, it's cute. And evidently the locals who have given good reviews must have burned off their tastebuds, so at least the Cafe has that going for them. And the wall of dog photos is charming. The structure fools you into thinking the place might actually have good food and drinks.  Don't be fooled. It's doesn't. And, the staff could care less if the food and drink taste bad."
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Coffee was delicious, and I loved the vibe. Super inclusive & supportive. The owner was lovely!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,That $13 juice... kind of expensive
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Beautiful Cafe with so many subtle touches! There was a lot of love put into this place. The upstairs is an awesome nook, perfect for work/studying. This is now my favorite smoothie place in SF! Highly recommend their Coconut Mango smoothie!"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Went in 35 mins before closing, and they only were making lattes since ""it was about to close."" Lattes were way too sweet. Strange vibes all around. Would recommend going elsewhere."

Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Such a welcoming space. Great coffee and snacks. Lovely staff. I've lived in this neighborhood for 8 years and have frequented this local spot a lot. I have to say the current owner/staff/situation is BY FAR the best. I'm so happy that we have such a gem in the neighborhood again!
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,Great place! Very tasty coffee
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,This is a lovely little cafe with a super hippy vibe and loads of choice for smoothies and coffee. The first thing I saw walking in was a little dog on a chair by an electric fire getting a snooze in! The staff were really friendly and I got recommended an iced oat chai latte which was delicious. Will definitely be back!
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Absolutely delicious. Sweet spot on the  corner, great choice of vegan treats and super kind service. 💚"
Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,A neighborhood spot with great coffee and a good selection of quick bites perfect for a snack or light lunch.

Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"All indoor seating is gone and top floor was closed to employees only, so this is more of a grab n go spot than a sit down cafe like the pix show unfortunately :("

Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,"Rating is only for hours.  Second time recently  I’ve come here during business hours in AM and it’s just closed. For a coffee shop that is only open until 3, you’d think I they’d want to be selling food and coffee in the morning."

Karma Cafe,1901 Hayes St,A takeout order of two breakfast burritos and a salad took thirty minutes longer than they said and they got the order incorrect
