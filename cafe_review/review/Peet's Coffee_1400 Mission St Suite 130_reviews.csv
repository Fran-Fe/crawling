Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Doing the best they can considering the horrific conditions outside. Homeless doing drugs, directly outside the door. Employees are wonderful. The coffee is great… it’s nice to have somewhere safe to sit down and relax after walking through the mission and being completely disgusted by the conditions of this city."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Nice coffee with warm welcome batista,  nice atmosphere also"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"One of the best places to camp out and work remotely! Good Wifi, good taste of music selection, very very friendly staff. The only thing to consider is that every now and then some homeless/drugged people walk in to take a rest. But if that doesn’t bother you (like me), then this is a really great place. I love the communal table. It is so ridiculously gigantic to spread out all your stuff."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,The best seating coffee in SOMA. Not many coffee shop thinks about customers' seating in shop since after Covid. This is the way (Mando' voice) of coffee shop.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"In an area inundated with world class coffee shops, this one stands out as one of my personal favorites. If you happen to come here in the fall, be sure to try the seasonal pumpkin beverages, like the pumpkin late / iced late, as they are probably among my favorite pumpkin drinks I've ever had - and I'm a big fan of pumpkin drinks!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"The nicest staff, with failing management. It’s been four times (three just this week) that my simple mobile order takes 40min to be filled. And, I see other patrons asking about their substantially delayed order."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Place is clean, appreciated. Got a barista-in-training, with no fault of the barista, my latte was too full, no froth"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"This location is close to my workplace. I always stop by for a morning coffee and bread. The lattes were not made with fresh espresso, which caused the lattes to taste bitter. I preferred if they used fresh espresso, not pre-poured espresso for the lattes. I taste the difference. If they made each hot coffee drink with fresh expresso I will go here more often."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Unlike Starbucks our barista at Peet's was the friendliest and had NO attitude. My friend and I felt really welcome and comfortable while visiting with each other at this coffee house. Just doing a lil catching up w/a buddy I hadn't seen in a while. Thanks Peet's for being so calm, cool and pleasant."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,I just got mia chocolate mocha. I was disappointed that they did not stay open on her enough but it was a cool place of definitely going back.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Peet’s coffee on misión st, the location is nice and the customer service too, but too many homeless. 2 weeks ego, there’s a figth, and today too. One of de employees were scare, because they should have a sacurity. I like the place but am not going so often because of the homeless."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"You know, 5 stars for this Peet's location is about right. The atmosphere is always at its best. It is often quiet and has space for seating since the Twitter madness in the area is gone."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Nice Pete's coffee and snacks available always consistent!
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I ordered coffee with cookies 🍪 they charge it but I never got  cookie , cofee was good 👍 all are good …"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Some of the friendliest people around, especially too early in the morning. I'm literally on a first name basis with many of the crew, that's how cool this crew is. If you've got the app, you can pre-order and pick up your drink, what more can you ago for?"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Decent coffee and non-sweet mochas, particularly for a chain. Don't get whipped cream on your mocha unless you like paying large prices for medium drinks :)"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Comfy, denied bathroom code until bf came in and bought coffee, we were coming for coffee anyways but whatever"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I don’t know if it’s just me, but I feel this Peets is not as good as other Peets. Their coffee qualify is not as good as other branches I go. The service also needs improvement. The stafs here has no smile and seems like they don’t want to be there. Besides this, I would say don’t order the skinny latte and just order normal American or regular latte. Their skinny latte is terrible, tastes like cough syrup and I had to throw away the whole drink."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I especially like this Peet's in SF. A spacious/perfect place to relax and people watch! It's a very busy location and I love the seating area!  They designed it to have everyone  get a view of the hustling and bustling neighborhood through the big glass windows. The times I've been there, I've always had luck with good customer service.  Good coffee! Nice experience!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,The staff are very friendly however watch when they make your coffee. Three times now when I've ordered an almond milk latte I watched the Baristas start moving too fast and put whole milk instead of almond milk in my latte
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Can someone teach baristas to steam milk? When it’s regular they burnt it, when I ask warm it’s almost cold. By the way baristas at Market street Peet’s do it perfectly."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,I love Peet's Coffee they're fresh roasted beans are always what I need... they have a nice selection of treats also.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Been here a few times. The layout of the place is narrow and it gets busy. The staff are friendly and generally have had a good experience with drinks. One night we were there while they were taking photos for marketing, and because of the disruption they were nice enough to give us a free drink voucher. I think this place is much better than the Starbucks nearby."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Coffee's great, service needs work. They recently moved order pickup behind a barrier so if you order ahead on the app and walk straight back to the pick up counter, expect them to pretend you're not there while they work 2 feet away from you even when it's not busy."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,I we to Peet's coffee ☕ at 10th. And Mission st. I ordered a vanilla frappe. It was good. Next time I will go check out other than the one on 10th.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Nice spacious location but the service is subpar. Often missing items from the food menu, very slow even when not busy, and the drink quality varies. You are better off going across the street to Cumaica. Great coffee and serve there."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,My brisk morning walk took me to peet's coffee for Christmas.  So I guess I do celebrate love Christmas in a roundabout way. The other day I painstakingly ventured out to peet's for a brevé latte and it was so Incredibly good i almost thought of bargaining for a refill.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Staff is very friendly. I ordered an oatmilk latte - took more than 13 mins to get it and the oatmilk was steamed way too hot…
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Very nice place to have a great coffee, work remotely, meet with a friend to chat. One of the best features of this place is that it does *not* have loud music playing (which is the case at a Starbucks just a block away). The location is not at the best place in San Francisco - at the same time you are one block away from the headquarters of millennial companies like Twitter, you are also in the middle of one of the worst areas in San Francisco, where you might step on human feces while avoiding homeless camps if you are not careful - classic American gentrification at its best! (nothing of this is Peet's responsibility, but it's good to know before you decide to walk to this place)."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"* Everything plant-based sandwich - delicious  Was sad to see there weren't many other vegan food or pastry items on the menu, hopefully they get more in the future!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Fast service: I placed my mobile order a minute before entering this Peet's and my order was ready within a minute after my arrival. Covid-19 public health guidelines: all followed - masks worn by staff and patrons, plenty of space for social distancing by customers, seating areas blocked off. Only complaint: I had requested my mocha extra hot and it was just lukewarm at pickup."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,So this was my first time ever at Peet's Coffee and was excited to see what all the hoopla was about. I have no complaints but no more exciting nor great than other great coffee shops. They have a great selection and right now it's pumpkin season too! The issue I had was they had me and another customer with very similar names and the other customer had a food allergy and they didn't know which coffee was which.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,I bought coffee here but they did not allow me to use bathroom. LIARS on counter. 12/29/21 12.40 pm. Starbucks is way better.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"""May I take your order?"" apparently means ""Shut up and drink whatever we give you!"" I've specifically ordered a ""Small Lt. Roast Drip Coffee, Black"" three times here, and each time they've ignored me and put milk in it. Lousy work ethic or management"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Very people-friendly place with excellent music and coffee. Great vibes!
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,The grinded up some coffee for me. Brought it on my trip and it was so fresh!
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Friendly staff and excellent coffee
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Get the app, it is way better than Starbucks and the baristas are actual people!!!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"The staff is pretty friendly and orders are served quickly. The only disturbance that needs to be mentioned that some customers who come in don't need respect the space they entered. Also, adding an automatic door for disabled people would be nice."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Pretty consistent by Peet's coffee standards.  Peet's doesn't have the best coffee, but it does the job and they have the BEST cold press O.J. which I likely to quickly down before sipping my coffee that accompanies my cinnamon twist--since they no longer have morning buns.  Boooooooooooo!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Great place for some great coffee and awesome view!
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"This place is awesome! The wifi is pretty good, the drinks are nice and they have this awesome big table in the back that is great if you want to work on something with friends or colleagues. I come here at least once or twice a week."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I think this location needs to establish a line. Just something simple so the zombies in the morning aren't bumping into each other... Starbucks has it figured out, make a straight line and follow it all the way to the register. If you don't do that, the simple coffee zombies will roam all over the place. Also, to speak up for those of us who actually drink tea, we are customers too and I don't want to have to wait until all the coffee zombies get their drink before I get mine. WOW 😥 No respect! Location is great, work on customer service."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Service has gone downhill at this Peets location. Blond lady has a tendency to harass people about smoking at yhe curb and getting refills. Even when she served the initial beverage. Only given a second star for the coffee itself. Blond lady has been very rude and if i could find the management info she would/should be reported......😵😵🆓
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"""Peet's Coffee chain in the U.S., has raised €2.25 billion ($2.5 billion) in an initial public offering"". This Mission and 11th Peets won't serve you a HOT cup of coffee in the winter if you want it any other way than BLACK. They're  too corporate, litigious and generally paranoid of a McDonalds-like suit."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,The coffee here is good but the staff needs to keep up with cleaning the place. This is high traffic and the bathrooms we're DISGUSTING when I visited today. Two members of my group notified the staff and they didn't seem to care.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Their hot drinks are always so well made! Very friendly staff and large, clean space!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I arrived at this Peets as the doors where opening in the morning. I ordered my drink a coffee fog and headed to the bathroom. The toilet was covered in urin and looked as if it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks. Personal hair was everywhere , and for a moment I wondered if I could hold it for the next two hours, but knowing that I could not I used several seat covers. I didn’t even want to wash my hands as the sink was way to dirty to touch. I grabbed a seat cover and pressed the faucet on. 😫😖 I swear I have never seen such a filthy bathroom in a Peets before ,and I work all over the country. On a positive note the employees were nice and the coffee not bad."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I come here all the time, maybe not everyday. I'm all over the Bay area,I could be in anyone of the stores. This is the time of the year that there drinks change. I guess they have to keep it fresh, I'll just have to wait until my favorite comes back, until then I'll go back to my old standby."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Last week I ordered a hibiscus tea and it was delicious. Unfortunately, I have tried ordering it since and I have had no luck. I was told earlier this week more would come in on Wednesday. Today is Thursday and more hibiscus tea has not yet arrived. I wonder if it was even ordered."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Gentrification, contrary to popular thought is not a good thing. Not wanting to see people with backpacks is prejudicial. You're really going to assume I have no home because I have a pack? Just because we're all so ""woke"" now we don't see color does not make it alright to judge based on: my appearance, my smell, or my wallet.  Separate yet equal is most definitely NOT equal."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Many seats and tables,  some plugs, and clean bathroom. First time i came here, usually go to Starbucks around market and must say this peets is so much cleaner and nice, i dont think ill go back to those other starbucks again!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Updated to lame 7/_18 New locale. Good staff.  🌁Good outer products selection. Close to tweeter'$ building and pot clubs and knight clubs night clubs🌆 and concert venues and on.🐺 Change and deterioration:7/15: Oh how dirty and the care left weeks ago. Always out of cream, $type drinks are mostly foam. Drying tiny foods? are$$$ same for pot club and other coffee shop, republ$$$$can mindset.q"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Good staff good coffee and the store is generally relaxing. Good for casual meets and a place to do ""home work"" with a laptop or pepper if you can get a seat with a table..which for most of the time is ez."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"I hate doing this. I expect if I wasn't currently homeless this review would be different. But I am, so here it goes. I can characterize most of the interactions with staff as cordial , helpful and cheerful. The young varieties who work there earn kudos from me for the work they do here. Even the management staff do their jobs in the manner you would expect in an establishment such as this. So why the one star? Because I had asked for some hot water for a French press I purchased from Peets months ago to brew coffee simply because I just cannot afford single cup prices all the time. So I buy a pound of coffee, have it ground for my French press all from the same store. You know what the hell, I might be homeless but I am a loyal Peets customer for years and need a good cup of coffee in the morning. I came in with the press ready and instead of filling up the carafe and providing a complimentary cup like they always do she filled up the carafe with hot water but refused to provide the cup. So I had to fish one out of the garbage can. Since it was used for chain it mage my cup of Major Dickinson's Blend to taste like chai. I hate being treated like I don't belong. I am homeless because of circumstance not because of some personal character defect. Yes, I asked them to do something for free but what they do not see is an old man who is struggling for some sense of normalcy in his life and this morning that cup of coffee meant exactly that to me. And that was taken away from me because management decided to be petty. This was uncalled for. I am not an idiot. I hold 2 engineering degrees and jointly share 3 patents with Eastman Kodak. So I know what I'm talking about. While I was with Kodak I was the winner of customer service awards form 2 years in as I row. The most important things about customers is that you must treat ALL CUSTOMERS THE SAME WAY. Everyone must be given that respect that customers get. If the didn't want to give me jot water they should have said so and not play game with my head. I made sure everyone in the store knew that because of management s pettiness I had to pull a cup out of the trash to use. I sympathize with staff on the homeless issue. I don't want anyone to lose their jobs over this, except maybe the store manager who has yet to appear freom the back of the store. I have said enough I think"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Ordering beans was a chore, customer service not up to Peet's standards. Wasn't even offered a cup of coffee for ordering a pound. Wanted two roasts mixed together, had to ask that the beans be mixed twice. Had to ask for tape to seal the bean bag. They are phoning it in."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Best coffee gets me going! Havana cap. On my mind si señor!
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"For 1400 Mission Street, San Francisco. Please turn down to a minimum or turn off the air conditioning above the cushioned seats facing 10th street.  Every-time I'm here, people next me complain and becoming irritating; and an unpleasant experience. It's hot outside and neither does it feel stuffy inside. Thank you."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"What an amazing set of Barista's at this location Alyssa,Bella bigA I call her that . ..you should see this lady run those machines, courtney gives relentless service gives this place a never ending line sometimes wonder how they do it.  Sincerely Tim"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Peet's coffee is the best! Especially on chilly mornings like today.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,The coffee is always good but you will have to ask extra hot if you like it hotter than after they have readjusted the temperature following the lawsuits against McDonald and Starbucks
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,The Peet's coffee on the corner of 10th and mission has but God forbid you asked to use the restroom before you make a purchase and they look at you and treat you like you are some type of vermin. And just for that reason I will never return.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Nice cup of coffee. Also veggie
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"By far the cleanest Peet’s store i’ve stepped into! Friendly staff & excellent customer service, walk in, walk out with your beverage in less than 2 mins or less. Gotta come back more often to this Peet’s!"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Panoramic exterior, airy, 30 feet high ceilings. Great working space while enjoying superb cup of coffee. Not crowded."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,I am freezing my butt off outside the store and the worker slowly unloads boxes of pastries. He saw me. It's now 3 minutes past opening times and he still wouldn't open. It took a delivery man to get the door opened. Very sad for Peet's.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Love Peets. This is a new location for them. A lot more seating than at their other locations in San Francisco. Good wifi. Friendly staff.
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Good coffee and croissants. Efficient and friendly service
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"As far as chain shops, Peet's has to be my favorite. Experience is variable/staff dependant, but this location has been pretty solid."
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,"Great place to have a coffee. If you need an outlet to charge your phone, there it is! The attendants are really kind too"
Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Really cool building and interior design. The staff were really nice and helpful. I just picked up a medium black coffee and it was spot on.

Peet's Coffee,1400 Mission St Suite 130,Generally good coffee. Service is a tad bit lacking at the bar.
