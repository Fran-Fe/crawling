Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"I ordered an oat milk cappuccino which was good. Somehow it seemed to have a watery texture, not quite as creamy as I prefer. I'll have to try some other drinks to get a good idea of their in-house roasted beans.  It's a small cafe...the seating is tight, so we sat outside and enjoyed our beverages while people-watching. 9th Ave is always a bustling little corridor.  The Beanery has a friendly staff and is a great place to grab a cup of coffee to take with you to Golden Gate Park. Check it out!"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,This coffee was PHENOMENAL. Best coffee of my life. I had a double espresso and it was like drinking silk. Kept me feeling focused and buzzed all day but so smooth and not acidy at all. Gorgeous.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Coffee and cafe atmosphere was great, not the staff’s attitude. We came in on a Thursday afternoon (4/30/23) not a busy day or peak hours, asking the staff if they have regular hot mocha as their mocha was listed under the espresso section on the menu, the staff looked puzzled and agitated, asking me what I meant by regular mocha and yes their mocha is mixed with coffee in a regular size cup. To my basic understanding of coffee, espresso is a small cup of concentrated Italian coffee and we were asking just to make sure that it doesn’t come in a small cup. We felt like we were not welcomed and asking a question is a waste of this staff’s precious time. There’s definitely a lot of room for customer service improvement."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,I have had the recent experience of ordering my favorite drink ~ Mocha. I enjoyed it so much I had to go back the following Monday to grab another. This may be my go to spot for an afternoon pick me up. Although I have not bought any yet one can purchase coffee by the pound and it seems comparably priced.woth coffee from the local market. The service had that extra local feel to it as if they care a little more than one of the larger chain coffee shops. As a local who lives close by I will make an effort to stop by more frequently. Also good to note there are a few spots outside and inside to sit down and spend time with a friend or just relax to some music.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"This is my go to spot for coffee whenever I'm in the sunset. They have a great mocha, not too sweet or too bitter. Chill vibes, a lot of people like to hang out here and people watch, and it's usually so busy I can't find a seat ha ha but luckily I usually walk around to shop anyway. Their pastries are ok, but I really recommend the coffee as it's not overly fancy, not overpriced, and hits the spot."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,A wonderful roastery and coffee shop. Lovely knowledgeable staff. Delicious coffee beans and fresh coffee all day. Right on at least three bus lines and street parking available. Get your beans whole to go so they stay fresh longer. The sumatra is wonderful.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,It’s a nice looking cafe and roaster very close to the botanical garden. Went there based on the reviews but was a little disappointed with the double cappuccino I ordered - I’ve had better from Starbucks. Could’ve just been my luck so will try again and update.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,I like their roast beans.  I enjoy Cafe au lait and mixing it with 2 different coffee beans. I enjoy the aromatic flavor at the end.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Love the vibe! They have all the good add ons for your coffee, outdoor and indoor seating."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Snowbird is my go-to cafe in this area but I went here because it was closed. It's cheaper than other places but still not worth it. I might have been just unlucky but it tasted so stale that I couldn't finish it. Definitely not coming back.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Good coffee, friendly service, cozy old San Francisco vibe. Got a mocha with oat milk and it was up in just a few minutes ☕"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Great selection of herbal teas and the other patrons are so interesting to chat with. The tables are made of beans.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Great little coffee shop. Love the coffee here. Food options are minimal.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Local neighborhood coffee shop. Large black coffee $2.35 — not $7. Delicious. TIP: Wesr side of street for morning sun so you can sit outside and sip.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Love this place, great to grab coffee and lemon poppy seed cookie.   Definitely a local scene, people reading and playing scrabble.   Appreciate they use proper mugs if you are drinking in the café."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Good coffee, bad service!!! They cheat people.  If you a order a small drink they charge you for a medium.  They say because its already set in the register??? Then modify the register or don't offer small size drinks! You can't cheat people! I wonder how long they have been cheating the customers??? They should be reported! They will get punished.  Its call Karma!"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,The barista upfront treated my elderly mother very rudely. Not worth stopping by when we can go somewhere down the street.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"After a walk through the California Academy of Science, we discovered is was time for coffee O'clock.  Just a few minutes down the road, we discovered the Beanery on Google maps.  The coffee was perfect, the baked goods delicious and the ambiance a perfect way to end an afternoon."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Really nice well balanced latte, with good pastries. I liked that they have the old guys talking politics and the young tech guys sitting side by side. My only complaint was the creepy music... It was like a sad monster mash hit list."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Coffee always good some pastry too but not the croissants unless you get them early.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"I am a self professed Americano daily drinker and the one I got today was exceptionally flavorful, fresh and dark roasted!! Balance of espresso and little water (not watered down too much) Very friendly and I ended up picking up a 1/2 lb of organic French roast whole beans. Very reasonable price for less than $9. While I am on the quest to check out various independent coffee spots, so far this place is ranked #1!"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Great location, great service. Excellent coffee. Most likely the best coffee in San Francisco. They even have these fine looking mugs at a nice price."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Great local coffee with chairs and tables to sit at. Seems sooo good inside as you enter. While I am a basic cappuccino gal, I love taking home their Guatemala coffee to have at home... can't go wrong. This is not a harsh nor dark coffee so if you like medium/light roast, this is for you. Also they are open such that you can put in your own sugar, cinnamon etc.. another wonderful piece of normalcy."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,They have good coffee and the vibe is cool
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Excellent coffee and friendly staff. Try their Sumatra, it's one of the best roasts in San Francisco."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Nice coffee w pastries. Morning hang out before heading to work. Friendly customers and happy Staff.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"We stayed four mornings in the Inner Sunset neighborhood a few steps from Beanery. It instantly felt like my neighborhood beanery. Cruz welcomed me each morning making me feel more like a neighbor than tourist. The coffee is exquisite. I typically don't drink large black coffee but the flavor and drip heat level made it really easy. I drank the Mocha Java or Single Origin Peru. They also have refill pricing. The pastries are fresh, local and tasty.  You can sit or outside. Looking for a neighborhood, local feeling spot. Try beanery."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Very good macchiato  (the espresso alone tastes a tad too roasted for my palate --- I don't add sugar to my coffee. Prices are very reasonable, and they can serve your coffee in ceramic cups on request."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Dark roast flavor Fair trade coffee roasted in house Very friendly service Beautiful coffee shop
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Consistently amazing coffee bagel and pastry. I come here often. Thank you for great quality food and bev!
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Good coffeehouse!!! What a wonderful place just seating down and sipping coffee while looking at the coffee beans is being roasted right before you eyes! I downgraded from 4 stars to 3 stars because of the bad consumer service that the Asian staff gave me.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,My current favorite roaster. We are up in The City every month or so and I stock up on their French and Italian roasts
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Coffee I had was great & Kristen who was working was the nicest barista I've met on my short trip (& 5 coffee shops) in San Francisco. Plus there's a gorgeous San Franciscan Roaster up front
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,EXTRA dark roast.  Delicious and I do not overdose.  Tomato and cucumber was crisp and fresh on my toasted bagel.  Great jazz playing.  People are not shy about asking to share if the tables are all occupied.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Not sure why I like this place as much as I do...I don't even drink coffee. Their teas are good and the owner seems nice. They roast coffee right there in store and it smells amazing.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"I enjoyed this spot . I sat and worked and watched people come and go . Seating in and outside . Big help! The coffee was good , Prices good and staff was nice"

Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Charming neighborhood institution. Had a lovely talk with the owner as he roasted up a batch of his espresso blend in an beautiful San fransiscian roaster right in the front of the shop.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Coffee doesn’t taste good, cut place though"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Wow... their coffee is a true eye-opener. Plus, not that expensive for a fair amount of coffee (refill for iced coffee only costs a dollar). You should try it!"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,Great vibe for the best coast. Such a great corner of the world. A crossroads for all walks of life. All great people.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"I love the Beanery. They always have dark roasted coffee on hand, which is a must for me. This location has great people watching."
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"My drip coffee, tastes like the beans were burnt, or maybe the coffee had been sitting over heat for a long time....Really pleasant service though, unfortunately i was mainly there for the coffee"
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Great coffee, great atmosphere, but a bit crowded. The space is really small, but they still have a couple of tables set up."

Beanery,1307 9th Ave,After a visit to the de Young in Golden Gate Park this is our place for coffee and a sweet. Great coffee and weather permitting a table on the sidewalk.
Beanery,1307 9th Ave,"Gone downhill.  Coffee not that great, seating changed. And MTA is destroying parking in the area.  They won't be there someday.  SF is anti-small business."
