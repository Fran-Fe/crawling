Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,"One of my favorite subterranean coffee shops since part of the shop is below street level. Serving bicycle coffee. The sandwiches, bagels & snacks are always fresh & the family that runs this shop treats everyone like a regular which I appreciate. There's an outlet by the stereo and it's a nice place to work & people watch if that's your thing"
Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,"Roast beef sandwich, Turkey avocado sandwich on sourdough bread, and grilled cheese were our orders and it was very good! Wonderful service to top it off. Three little dining tables for dine in. There’s an available washroom, just not the cleanest space."
Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,"Ordered a special veggie on a jalapeño cheddar bagel and a small coffee. Bagel was super tasty with fresh ingredients and coffee was tasty. Spent less than $10 for take out breakfast.  Came back a year later. Delicious sandwich and coffee. Relaxing cafe atmosphere with excellent friendly service and nice background music. Great to grab a meal, get some work done, or hang with friends. I had the #3 turkey sub with the works plus avocado, pickles, and jalapeño, with a cafe au lait. Spent about $15 for dine in lunch."
Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,Owner is very kind. Ice vanilla latte is really good. They have probably the best coffee shop breakfast sandwich in SF (croissant sausage & cheese) very fast and affordable.  My go to in the morning.
Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,"Asked for a latte and got a vanilla latte (extremely sweet), and when I told the barista I wanted an unsweetened latte she said I had ordered a vanilla latte. Never in my life have I ordered a vanilla latte. Had to pay for regular latte that wasn’t even very good."
Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,"The coffee is as disgustingly delicious, I came in for their salivating savory sandwich and got sweet customer service. I might be diabetic ...Thanks 😊 🙏 …"

Earth's Coffee,3400 Geary Blvd,"Lady is very friendly, food gets prepared before your eyes, great location.   Geary is the main street but the cross street, Commonwealth, is rarely used and very wide that one can double park for a few minutes without causing any type of traffic jam.  Love it."
