Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Great coffee shop — look for the blue awning! We buy a cafe au lait and a vanilla latte — fresh, warm, and delicious. Definitely would come back for crafted beverages. Also appreciated the pastry selection, which included a gluten-free lemon bar and macaroon cookies."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I love this coffee shop, amazing atmosphere, delicious coffee and great service) Many thanks to Damir, who inspires this place :))"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Stumbled upon this place and will definitely be coming back. Had a wide variety of coffee drinks, pastries, and other assorted food snacks. Price was amazing! Plus they had very cool coffee bean flavors to take home."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,This place hands down has to be the coffee Mecca for all of Bay Area if not Cali! I haven’t seen a more authentic coffee shop - they had fresh coffee beans getting roasted. You will be spoilt for flavors in any kinda coffee that you may want! If you’re starting to get into making coffee at home - do visit this place!  We got the pumpkin spiced latte and the Nutella latte - both were perfect drinks to give us a mid day pick me up nudge on a windy day in SF!
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Stopped by early Sunday morning, actually before they officially opened at 8 am. Great coffee at very inexpensive price! Nice folks that work there. A true find. Must visit again."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Spotted this place while on a walk and I'm so glad we stopped by, such great service and coffee.  I got a mocha and it had the perfect balance of chocolate and coffee. The man behind the counter was very friendly and gave great recommendations for treats and drinks.  They have baked goods and a great assortment of coffee beans.  It's a small space once in the shop so a line was forming out on the sidewalk, and masks are a must.  For sure stop by here."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I can’t wake up without Castro Coffee Company. The alarm goes off and I’m excited to jump out of bed and either go there or have some at home.  Castro Coffee Company feels like a relic from a better time. A family owned coffee shop where they roast their own beans, put love into every cup & really make you (and your dog) feel like family.  I also personally love flavored coffee (although they also have non-flavored). There was a similar place in the town where I grew up and for 15 years, I haven’t found anything like it until I found Castro Coffee Company.  If I could give 10 stars, I would."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,This spot deserves all the love! coffee/drinks are reasonably priced! The staff is so nice and just super fun little pit stop before you keep walking to explore more of the area! I’ve had their Matcha Latte and their Mocha both with Oat Milk. Both were super good!
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Simply put, this coffee shop does it right. Great ambiance, knowledgeable staff, and exceptional coffee. It's a go-to spot for any coffee lover."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Perfect place to take a quick break while wandering through the Castro. The drinks are delicious and the pastries  mouthwatering. Take the coffee home with you by picking up a bag or two of beans.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Incredible Coffee blends at inexpensive prices. For example I get Organic Joe Black.  1 pound only $9.95  Family run excellent customer service.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Early last year my husband came home with a pound of coffee , gift from one of his customers .We fell in love with the coffee from Castro and I order on a regular base ever since. I order online as we live in Nebraska and they process and ship fast. Wished I could visit the place 🙂"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"SO MANY B E A N S ! They have an endless variety of roasts that you can get beans for. The staff is super friendly, and the drinks are really good."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,This place is better than any other upscale coffee shops in thr bay area. Variety of beans to purchase. They also make the the their standard drip coffee taste great.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"If you’re a coffee lover you must go to this place in this charming district. They’re have a huge variety of coffee types from worldwide and a combination with different flavors I never had before as: Caramel Cream, Amaretto, Chocolate Mint, French Vanilla, Raspberry, etc. We’ve got: Vanilla Nut Cream(decaf), Chocolate Dark Truffle and they’re amazing. Also the staff is kind & helpfully and the price is good!"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Amazing locally-owned coffee shop! Runned by a fabulous father and son duo for 35 years. Locally sourced coffee beans from farmers and their coffee selection will blow your mind! Highly recommended ✨
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Quite simply, the best coffee I've had to date.  The owners know coffee and guided me cup by cup to the perfect brand and blend for me as well as perpetration.  I love the coffee I get from here."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Been coming here for thirty years. Their coffee is the best!!  Wonderful family owned small business. Community vibe. And again - the coffee --- sooo goood!!  Buy coffee drinks, pastries, bagels, or coffee by the bag or bean. Also coffee cups and pretty much anything you need that is coffee related!  The folks who work there get to know you and your order.  It has a real community feel.  There are tables and chairs so you can eat and drink outside.  The place is small but would work with a walker. Wheelchair maybe a big harder.  It's on the first business block of Castro - next to the Castro theater.  Parking is on the street - metered - or in the small parking lot on the block - also metered - or find street parking nearby - metered.  It's by a bus line."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"A San Francisco tradition: great prices on whole beans, excellent coffee/espresso drinks, and every accoutrement you could need."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Stay away. These are rude people living off of a traditional place, but who have no respect for customers. It makes me sad to see how they think they can mistreat people. The owner could not even raise his eyes to look at me after I entered the store because he was busy watching a football game. After I asked about the coffee he has brewed the day, he just pointes at the chalk board and started yelling ""right there"". I left immediately. I hope Starbucks buys the place so he can spend more time in a retirement home watching his games."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"No good, got offended by the atmosphere. Cakes were stale."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Awesome mainstay for quality coffee ( single cup or bulk) serving Castro for a long time! I have never been disappointed yet with all the trials with various flavors and new coffee beans I have tired at this place.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,This coffee store is much better than Starbucks! They provide a great selection of coffee and delicious meals at a reasonable price. Their workers were really kind and accommodating. I'd want them to create a second location even closer to me so that I may stop by and get their finest coffee every day before going to work!
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Really liked this place. I worked with Ken, the owner, to blend up something delicious. He was knowledgeable and friendly. Beyond the charm of the owner, the coffee was excellent!"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"This is easily my favorite store in SF. They're always friendly, my dog usually gets a treat, and the coffee is so well priced. This is everything you want out of a mom and pop shop. Really, I rave about them to friends all the time (I swear to god I'm not a fake account writing this. Just a huge fan!)"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"The owner is the Master Guru of coffee. He knows all the best roasts,best varietals and Best brands and roasters. The staff are always friendly and in a good mood and have great recommendations.  They have helped me out so many times with a smile,  and their friendliness and their great coffee."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Great coffee, and a wonderful family. I’ve been getting coffee from here for many years. I highly recommend the Sweet Italian."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Great visit. I was with a friend who recently moved to Cali, we were all over SF trying to find a place to get a cup coffee. It finally dawned on me to go to the Castro district. We went there, Castro Coffee was still open.  They were so nice and gracious to my friend who was in tourist mode.  The  coffee was so good but the best  part was the pound of coffee I bought, the dark Vienna roast.  So awesome.  Thanks gentelmen!"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Best local coffee spot, in my opinion. Incredibly friendly staff, always lots of different options for fresh coffee, and fair prices. One of the few coffee places left in the Castro that is reasonably priced. They've been serving the neighborhood for decades. I often see police in here getting a morning cup of coffee, which I love. It's the kind of place with lots of loyal customers. (They also have good pastries.)"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Gem in the Castro. Their French roast is one of my all time favorites, got 3 pounds for our 1 week SF visit and road trip down to LA. Staff is patient, knowledgeable, and friendly."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I use to go to Castro Coffee all the time when I lived just off of Haight and Divisadero, but kind of forgot about them since. I've been buying Starbucks for everyday coffee and Blue Bottle beans for when I want a really good cup. Well long story short, I stared buying some of my coffee beans from them as opposed to the others. I like the European Royale blend. It's nearly as good as the Blue Bottle but at a price that's actually lower than what you can get Starbucks for in the supermarket. It's a 4-mile round trip, but totally worth it for fresher, tastier coffee at an amazing price! The have dozens of varieties to choose from; I might get adventurous and try another for comparison."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"The Castro Coffee Company is my taste of home for me and my family. We lived in the Bay Area for 20 years and became coffee snobs because of Ken's coffee choices and his friendly smile to begin our day. So when I need a taste of home and the coffee I came to love, the Castro Coffee Company provides me with the coffee to begin my morning with those fond memories of Ken's smile, personality and great customer service. We do miss home but find comfort with that perfect cup of coffee with beans from the Castro Coffee Company."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I love the Castro Coffee Company! This is my go-to coffee shop after my morning bike ride around SF. CCC is a family-run business and they treat their patrons exceptionally well. My favorite beans (so far) are in the SF Sunshine Blend, and they also have a great selection of sweet and savory treats (the empanadas are delicious). I highly recommend CCC over other overblown, aesthetically-sleek coffee chains."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I’ve been shopping here for years. Best product knowledge, best products, latest assortment, amazing customer service. It beats ALL of those chain brand types of coffee shops."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,If you like terrible service and the lowest quality artificially flavored coffee then this place is perfect. The staff here is awful. I personally witnessed the “barista” mistreat a customer. I will never ever patronize this dump again.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,this coffee shop has been around since 1969-70 great coffee and they deliver now that I've moved to the Stockton area
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"My absolute FAVORITE coffee stop in San Francisco! The pastries are delicious. The coffee is amazing and the people are so Wonderful. I'm not from sf, but every time I visit I make a stop in each day. It's a must. I stock up on grinds to bring home until my next trip out."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Great coffee shop in Castro St, San Francisco. Was like my local coffee shop away from home when on holidays. Quality freshly brewed coffees at $2 -  cheap for San Francisco. Also Coconut, Oat, and Almond milks available. Selection of vegan flapjacks as well as regular donuts and pastries. Seating outside on the street to watch the world go by.  Ken the owner is a friendly guy  Highly recomended."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"The barista working on 10/23 at 6pm was terrible and so weirdly rude it was unbelievable. He started giving us really hostile attitude before we even ordered, it was shocking and super odd. When we asked why he was being so hostile, he said ""I'm always rude, everyone knows I'm rude."" Very bizarre.  To top it off, the beverage he made was awful. We actually ended up throwing them out."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Best coffee in town! Coffees from around the world! Always friendly service! Been going there for over 20 years and have never been disappointed! Pastries and chocolates are great too!
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Great coffee, coffee lover shouldn’t miss this place"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Love the Castro Cheesery! Been buying tons of beans from them for almost fifteen years. Lovely shop ,great folks ,sparkling clean ,friendly and open early ,super important to me as I travel early. Best small business in the city in my opinion. Coffee beans frim all over the world. From crazy tea blends to beans you might never have heard of."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Can't say I've had the best coffee of my life here, but it's nice to see local shops still thriving in a horrible economy. The service could've been a little more upbeat and a smile never hurts. The iced chai tastes like sweet milk (Oregon flavoring) but other than that the coffee is strong and get's you through the day. The selection is vast and I'm sure they know their stuff so ask away."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Coming from New England I'm a huge coffee snob. Finding inexpensive and good tasting coffee seemed like a lost cause in San Francisco until my wife and I stumbled into this shop. Great coffee, good selection and a welcoming local staff made for a perfect mid-morning caffeine break."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Cute small coffee shop with large variety of coffee roasts and flavored coffee, espressos and brewing methods items. The personnel is super friendly. They also have a small terrace where you can enjoy having your coffee facing Castro street."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"This place has been here almost forever.  They have a collection of brand new coffee presses and things to make coffee.  Plus, they sell coffee by the cup.  The best prices in SF, per cup, for very good quality, hot coffee.  I pay 1.95 for a med size cup. The people that serve you are friendly.  People are lined up, in droves, to buy the roasted coffee beans by the pounds! Almost always a short line. They have European style bakery pastries and some pre-packaged sweets on the front counter. Its a very small space that packs in tons of coffee products, for coffee lovers. See you in line!"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I buy here coffee to brew at home. A lot of choice. Staff is professional and friendly, provides advice...and it's cheap compared to the coffee  that you get at the supermarkets"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"There is a huge selection of drip coffee here, an even larger selection of coffee beans by the pound, and this place smells incredible. They also have lots of sweet and savory pastries to choose from, including vegan options and meat options. Their empanadas are particularly hearty, & I was surprised and satisfied with the amount of meat they actually put in the chicken empanata --which, instead of being microwaved, could definitely be tossed in a toaster oven to get the outside texture crispy. Still good nonetheless for the price. The people there were also very very nice. :-)"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Fantastic. The depth of flavor in the latte was impressive, the pecan square was well balanced, and a great price with great service."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Best coffee store in the Castro. The owners are very friendly and they have 8 drip coffees available at all times, brewed fresh throughout the day. A lot of exotic and hard to find coffees from around the world."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"They have a very wide selection of coffee beans. The price is unbeatable, there is always a coffee on sale. Seating is limited, so you won't sit here all day on your laptop."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"There is so much coffee in SF, and most of it is good. Problem is, paying $17 for 12oz of beans. Castro Coffee to the rescue. Most coffees are $10 a pound. They have more expensive stuff too, if you must empty your pockets. We like some of the cheaper varieties. This place has been here a while, and the staff is good and remembers you."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"My favorite coffee store in San Francisco. No pretension, just great coffee. They have 8 types of fresh brewed coffee with four or five rotating every day, and dozens of types of coffee. All reasonably priced, all delicious."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,A fantastic selection of roasted beans and way cheaper than boutique coffee places around town or even boutique brands at grocery stores.  For $9/bag you can do pretty well here.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Such a great shop. so many great coffees to choose from.  The service is very good, and they can help you choose just the right morning brew for you, and they're glad to help.  Lots of teas, too, and coffee equipment as well.  Enjoy."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,I really like there coffe fresh always owner and the wife doing great job
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Great coffee and vegan cookies! Pastries looks good
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Love their mochas and the regular coffee! The inside is nice but to small and crowded to have coffee and do homework. Good place to go out and have a coffee with a friend though.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Really friendly owner, and great coffee with non dairy options. The smell of the grounds is lush and you can perch outside and watch the Castro go by. No inside seating though."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I shouldn't contribute to the advertising of this small family - run shop, a staple in the neighborhood that in my opinion still serves the best espresso in the area (along with the Illy around the corner, but basically at half the price). You need to chug it down without anyhting added, though: no sweetener, no cream. You can also find a wide selection of beans for all tastes, at a bargain when compared to many other fancy (and honestly overrated) stores."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Castro Coffee Co is conveniently located on Castro Street, between Market and 18th, near the Castro Theatre and Cliff's Hardware (also of note: it's close to the US Bank ATM if you're low on cash). The service always comes with a smile. There's no room for sitting, and barely enough room for standing, but you'll want to take your coffee to go anyway, as there's so much to see on this stretch of Castro. The prices are very competitive ($1.50 for a regular coffee and $3-$4 for specialty coffees). They also offer pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and vegan snack bars."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I've been buying coffee here for YEARS! Everyone is super nice and helpful, even when I tried to find something for someone else. Great prices, excellent quality. I recommend Triple Dark."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I've bought my coffee beans here for more than 20 years,starting when  I had an apartment nearby.  it is the best coffee I've ever had and really  reasonable.  Even when I moved away for several years, i ordered from them both for myself and many friends who like me, had become spoiled by these delicious products. In fact, when an east coast friend wanted to come with me to visit, the one thing she insisted on was to visit the store, tiny as it is.  Afterward she shared it was one of the highlights of her visit.  I like to take their coffee as thank you giftss and in self-defense. Taking good coffee  assures you might actually get some when you are traveling.  This last trip, I bought ones that had California or San Francisco names, like Presidio, San Francisco Sunshine and California Breakfast  to name a few...a consumable souvenir.  Usually, whomever I take it to ends up ordering more after i leave. That morning, there was a lull (rare); I got to chat with the owner about how he creates his blends.  He has an incredible skill. It was  like interviewing a master vintner only about coffee beans instead of grapes  So if you have never been here, you have go to go; you have missed out on one ofthe most special little shops in the Bay Area."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"The best French Roast ever, I have been mail ordering it for 20 years! thank goodness they are open, I could not make it through the quarantine without their coffee, it's THAT  GOOD!"
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"Every month, the first of the month for years, I would go in and purchase my monthly stipend of coffee, and at that time, cheeses. I was poor as can be, but had to have the BEST to start my day with. Coffee...ummm...good! Now that I moved out of the area, it's been tough to find a great roastery, without traveling 15 miles. JUST discovered on my last trip to SF, that my favorite coffees aware available to order.   Yahoooo....! Just got my first assorted shipment. Ahhhh...mornings are going to be a LOT better now."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,The employees are very friendly & eager to help. The coffee beats Starbucks hands down with eight varieties of drip coffee and a multitude of blends to buy and take home. Apparently they used to sell cheese hence the (outdated) name found on google maps.
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,"I've gone here for decades, way back when they also had wonderful cheese. Castro Coffee offers quality coffee, prompt service, great internet  ordering, and the folks are just awesome."
Castro Coffee Company,427 Castro St,Experience their Turkish coffee for the first time. Amazing flavor. Just a friendly place. Then we sat down on 17th and Castro gay daysing the the melting pot of visitors and locals.
