Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Cute little gem in the quiet and historic park of Fort Mason, hidden in Hi hostel. The food is home-made, healthy and very tasty. The café is also very eco-conscious with focus on locally sourced ingredients and zero-waste practices.  I think it's a great place to grab a nutritious affordable snack or coffee and escape the hustle and bustle of the city."
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,Great little place tucked behind a hostel. I found it on google maps and wasn’t staying there so couldn’t find it at first. It’s up a staircase behind the hostel (harbor side of building). The quiche was delicious. Highly recommend.
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Great secret spot for locals to show tourists a great view of the bay, Fort Mason and Alcatraz. Sure there are plenty of hostelers most times."
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"A bit of a hidden gem, tucked away inside the hostel in Fort Mason. Basic food fare focused on fresh made salads and sandwiches, but all well made at a good price. Has a communal feel, no surprise given that it's embedded in the hostel building, but takes it one additional step in asking patrons to wash their own dishes (please). Unusual, but it triggered a healthy discussion with my young kids about helping."
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,Great hidden gem of a coffee shop. Coffee is great the view is even better!
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Cafe inside the hostel The tea is made from real loose-leaf tea, not tea bags. Great selection!"
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Best experience ever... over a ""French quiche"" and a delicious latte. Honestly, I can say this is one of the best experiences I have ever. I got lucky and did not use an app or directions to find this place. I ""followed my nose"" and I founded this hidden gem. And then, meeting other travelers is a plus, specially surrounded by the most beautiful views of the Bay. I'll be back soon for more quiche. Hector Villablanca."
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Great little cafe with bay views!  Good food for a good price. Try the baked goods, especially the zucchini bread.  The owner is a great baker (and a very nice human as well)"
Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Chill ambiance and staff, with wonderful glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and Angel Island. Have your breakfast, then walk down the rear door ramp into the historical Civil-War-Era Black Point Battery and enjoy immersive views of the Bay. Don't forget to buy your Cafe Franco travel mug before finally leaving."

Cafe Franco,240 Funston Rd,"Staying at Fisherman's Wharf Hostel is a different kind of fun. After entering the Cafe Franck restaurant, I saw a basketball match on TV. I ordered some food to acclimate myself to the pleasant atmosphere. Although rice dal is not available like in Kolkata, some fast food like potato chips, cookies, veg burger comes with boiled eggs. At the end talk with a friend, a call drinks 🍹. All in all it cost about eight dollars."
