901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Stopped here since I had some time to burn on the weekend. Chill vibes, very friendly people at the counter, and decent drinks. Got their limited eggnog latte and tiramisu and both items were excellent.  Good amount of seating here, can definitely imagine coming here with a laptop and working for an hour or two."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"This is a great place to grab something to eat before a show at Cobb's comedy club or bimbo's 360. The prices are super reasonable for the location, although the sandwiches are a little smaller than I expected. Great atmosphere. I think there are a lot of regulars from the neighborhood that hang out. I posted the menus as of June 2022"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Really great little find! Tasty food. Great bagel and panini variations! No overwhelming portions. Fresh OJ. Good coffee. Clean, friendly and good service. Toilets very clean; in need of refurbishment. Will definitely be back during our stay"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Neighborhood deli/coffee shop/ beer/wine😉  Ordered chicken panini, very good. Great stop for a before heading to Lombard St.!"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Although I wasn't Able to try Their Food or drinks as shortly after I walked inside I was informed they were closing and as I turned to leave I took a terrible fall, there were 2 gentlemen there as I said it was a closing so there weren't a lot of employees but they were great. They ran to my aid. They got my husband from outside. They were amazing sweet loving kind men and I can't say enough for how grateful I am for them helping me. My fall turned out to be a really bad one and it was no ones fault, It was just an accident I had fallen but I had A very intense surgery just 6 weeks prior so when I Fell I landed on What was my scar from my surgery and all the stitches had been removed weeks before, But unfortunately my fall caused that to open up. It was quite scary but as I said these 2 gentlemen that were working Saturday night, Were awesome they were great.  I can't say enough about their employees and because of that soon, I will head back to the city as soon as I'm healed and I will stop in and I will get something to eat and I will thank those gentlemen in person instead of just over the phone as I have."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,This place had delicious paninis!! They had a big menu and I wish I lived nearby. I'd probably go several times a week. They also had alcohol to go! I got a chelada and my lady got a very tasty mimosa. The staff was very friendly and it's under new management so the hours have changed so call in. I believe they close around 6pm
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"I was walking around town for about 5miles and stumbled upon this spot. $4 beer sign outside pulled me in. I enjoyed some Kona big wave and Elysian for total of $8, unheard of in any big city. The guy was friendly and I was able to enjoy the outdoor and the bustling traffic while enjoying some good 🍺 If u ever walking around Lombard st or the wharf, stop by here for some 🍺"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"⚠️Come here if you want to get POISONED! I came to this café this morning and I was just about to rate it five stars, but their labels don’t say what foods have nuts in them, and I’m allergic to nuts. I ended up getting food poisoning from the chocolate croissant and was sick almost the entire rest of the day. I had to stop eating my food and I barely got to eat any of it.  They didn’t even refund me for anything but $3 when I paid over $20 for the meal. Horrible service, the guy there was incompetent. 0/10 ❌"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Excellent neighborhood cafe. Staff is super nice. Price is fair. Sandwiches are tasty, good coffee as well"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Guy at the counter yesterday morning sat and had a conversation with a woman at the counter for several minutes, ignoring me and two other customers waiting and eventually we all left. Don’t really care how good the coffee is when employees are disrespectful. Too many places like this around here. Won’t be back."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Good waffles, a nice and quiet spot for breakfast in a corner of Columbus Ave in North Beach. Have a seat and enjoy the breakfast"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"For me personally, I think this is one of the last ""Great Ones"" as far as coffee shops go. An open space free WiFi, and plenty of tables to study, They have a nice touch to all the dishes they serve at a really reasonable price. Come show some love to this irresistibly comfortable new family owned Cafe❤️😀☕ …"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Great Products and atmosphere great people who are trusted & good morning sunshine prices ❣️
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great corner stop. Beer, Gatorade, coffee, smoothies. Bakery items, sandwiches and salads."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Best BLT I've ever had. Delisious. Cozy atmosphere. Polite staff.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,The sandwich was so good I wished it was bigger.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Highly recommended. Tasty and reasonable prices!
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,VERY Tasty 👍. Staff quite helpful in navigating around my annoying allergy to wheat flour. They had some delicious goodies some with quinoa corn or rye flour. We Love eating there.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Very unassuming place when you walk by but was glad to stop in. Don't expect anything fancy but it's a great spot to get a quick bite or drink. Staff were very friendly and the mimosas tasted great,  made with fresh squeezed juice."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Exceptional cafe, sandwich, and salad spot. It maintains a low profile and I hope it doesn’t get over run by people, but a perfect spot to work and grab lunch. The family that runs it are always friendly and very attentive. Some outdoor seating too!"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"This was a lovely little spot we stumbled on while trying to find something a 5 and 6 year old would eat. The gentleman behind the counter was great and helped us out by making grilled cheese for the kids. We had the panini, which he said were his “go to” sandwiches. The portions were sizable and very filling. The overall ambience of the establishment was eclectic and relaxing. Nice place to stop off, relax and enjoy a good meal before continuing on."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"My favorite cafe during my Northbeach stay: good coffee, croissants, yogurts and panini. Colorful, liked music, not too crowded, warm people."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Best tuna sandwich in San Francisco
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Stopped by for a quick breakfast burrito and sandwich while moving into the North Beach neighborhood. They weren’t just bad, they were inedible. Plenty of other cafes around to try instead. Skip this one."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Stopped there for lunch.  It was full but not overflowing, some tables with families, others with people alone working on laptops.  Unpretentious and comfortable, the wood tabletops worn smooth with age; big sunny windows looking onto Columbus. I had a salad which was fantastic, as was the coffee.  Sat there much longer than I planned to because it was so pleasant and welcoming."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great cafe! They have sandwiches, lunch, breakfast. I also like the vibes of the cafe very entertaining."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Some people see this as a great secret gem in the area but each time I have gone to this place I have been highly disappointed. The first time I went I ordered a wrap at the register and when I got the wrap it had the only two items I asked not to be on there. It made it inedible. I am not the type of person to return things so I left unsatisfied.  The second time was the same deal. The register person couldn't understand what I was ordering and then brought me the wrong item again. I can't get over this happening twice and I will not be returning to this establishment.  It is incredibly expensive for what they offer including lackluster salads and wraps. It is also cash only which it is not worth doing when you could go to many other better cafes in the area. Do yourself a favor and walk up the street to Cafe Sapore for lunch and Roccos for drinks. There are few places I actually refuse to go to and this is one of them.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,OMG...talk about a good sandwich! I've lived in the San Francisco Bay area for years! I think I've just had the best pannini I've ever had in a long time. Ordered the wiseguy it was perfection I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick savory bite.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Grungy basic Coffee House great with a greatb selection of food and beer.... nothing exceptional
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great place !!!!!! Great sandwiches and happy hour beers, breakfast too 👍🏻👍🏻will be back when in town again."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Cozy Little Cafe with a super tasty Caramel Apple Coffee Cake.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Very nice staff and food tastes good as well. The service was quick.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"I was not hungry enough to eat everything on the menu, and that is a shame. The Maui smoothie is fresh, tasty, and filling. Mellow jazzy tunes create a relaxing ambiance and the service was excellent."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Not really sure about this place. We popped in because of the homemade tiramisu""sign. It was fine... And the other pastries were fine also. Coffee is a bit weak for my tastes... But that's just me.  I also liked the atmosphere... But the overall impression was that it wasn't a real friendly joint; little rules like ""no cell phones at the counter"" and a sign to conserve napkins... And cash only. Nothing terrible, just left with bad impression overall."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Stumbled into this place after we put in the wrong address for our uber. Lucky us!!! I got the wiseguy panini and it was amazing. The mozzarella cheese tasted fresh. There is so much to choose from. The hubby got the Turkey club and it looked delicious and he said it was. The size of the sandwiches were a good size. Not over the top big but big enough to fill you up. Would definitely come here again. Wish I had this spot in my neighborhood back home.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Cheap draughts, cheap food, and great coffee would be enough to make most places great, however the owner is the nicest guy in world and I frequently bike out of my way to come here. Very bike friendly with a rack in the front, as well as accommodations for the roadies who refuse to let their steeds out of their sights. 10/10"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"We ended up here for lunch completely intentionally following a long morning seeing San Rafael and San Francisco.  It's certainly not much to look at from the outside, inside is also more functional over comfortable. As we found ourselves slightly bereft of options and with the clock ticking on we decided to try a couple of sandwiches. We had tuna on sourdough and pastrami melt on ciabatta, both of which were actually really good.  It wasn't too busy but at the same time there wasn't much choice in seating, we ended up in front of a large fan / air conditioning unit which was annoying as it meant having to try and pin all of our stuff down before it blew off the table."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Nice and warm, soft relaxing jazz in the background and delicious house coffee w. Almond Biscotti"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Great atmosphere for grabbing a beer and the happy hour prices are the best I've found in SF by a lot. $2.50 for a pint from 12 to close on weekends!  Pretty quiet and chill with free wifi so it's great to work or catch up with a friend over a beer. Food includes pastries and some sandwiches that look amazing.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Nice cafe in Litte Italy love it
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"This place has a great atmosphere, is always playing the best chill music, and makes great fresh food. I always get the Point Reyes on a croissant with a mocha zebra. I wish I could have breakfast here every weekend."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Good location but I’m not sure about the food. I think they might have microwaved my eggs for my bagel a bit much, giving it that rubbery consistency. The coffee was ok."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Do not recommend. The service here is terrible. Dirty bathroom. Sticky tables. Not only messed up the order but when I wanted to use the restroom I knocked and one of the employees walked out and started yelling at me saying I have to be patient when I was but I simply knocked he even mentioned go across the street so I'll recommend that to you all go across the street since the staff mentioned it themselves. Terrible do not come. Very rude customer and apparently they can't hear orders either.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,You can enjoy view of Lombard Street from the bottom staying down at this intersection.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Love the view of the Lombard Street. Visited twice and both times got the zebra mocha. Tried one of their treats and it was good (but can't remember which one since this was a while back) Would def go back if I am ever back in SF!
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Cozy cafe with great pesto and cheese sandwiches. Just what we needed for a casual Thursday night dinner. Not too expensive given the portion size, and a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the food in."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"I would give negative rating if i could. The staff is racist. They didn't ask if you are buying a drink or not before telling you there is no public restroom. I don't care your food is good or not, but the way the staff treat customer is really pissing people off. I asked for the name of the staff , he didn't even dare to tell his name."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Bad quality. Served me a croissant that had to be at least a full day old. Was like eating a dried out sponge. Coffee was mediocre too.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great staff, tasty food, local coffee and a huge awesome beer selection. Also outdoor seating. Oh yeah and a super good deal at happy hour which runs late."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,A very nice cafe. Very good friendly service. Nice atmosphere near Lombard street
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"I don't know if anyone has mentioned this already, I didn't see it in the top reviews, but the $2 beers they serve during happy hour are all Speakeasy brews.  $2 Big Daddy, Prohibition, and White Lightning.  That's premium quality stuff at PBR prices.  If you respect good beer and local microbrews, you might want to go in and have a pint."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Good Food and service. The tuna sandwich is very Good and the limoncello mascarpone cake truly recommended!
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Exactly what you would expect from a cute casual cafe
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"901 Columbus is fantastic. $2 beers during happy hour. Fast wifi. Down the street from Lombard. Good sando's. Must I go on? Okay - it's also a nice unassuming place to relax. They do a lot of stuff well here. You might find a better coffee shop, a better sandwich place, but this place does just about everything well. So...check it out!"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Tasty and fresh big sandwiches (salami is very good) and good draft beer, for a fast and not expensive informal stop and go. It saved my afternoon after hours of bike to golden bridge and back ;-)"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,We had really great papini sandwiches. The pesto was yummi and all the ingredients were fresh.  Service was very friendly and polite
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Just came in to buy a bottl of water but the ambiance was really great and decor also. Price for the menu (to eat) didn't look too expensive and the reason I didnt eat was because I was too much in a hurry but I would definitively try it !
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Coffee was luke warm and weak. It was dark roast and lighter than light roast. When I spoke to counter person, he offered to microwave the coffee which destroys the taste, rather than make a fresh cup of coffee"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,The only place in San Fran to visit. I come here every time I have to come to San Fran. Coffee is excellent bakery is the best and the food is great. Worth every penny you spend.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"You wait for simple salmon sandwich for 25 min, then they bring you something else and look at you like a garbage and tell you ""take it and bye"" after you ask for refund."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great little cafe without the queues of Fisherman’s Wharf, but close enough to walk. Friendly staff, excellent coffee, good breakfast and lunch menu, free WiFi."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Happy hours for a draft beer  $4
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great place to eat a sandwich and appreciate the view. The food was fresh and very well done, the staff was very nice and pleasant to help you."

901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,I love this place! Great sandwich and beer!
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Delicious macaroons! A few outdoor tables, plenty of indoor seating, wheelchair accessible, no bathrooms for public at this time"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Wish they had a better breakfast sandwich selection.  Overall though it's a nice place to sit down for a quick bite.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,I'll come back here and try other sanwiches. The tuna sandwich was great on ciabatta bread. Fast service and decent bathroom as well.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,I always used this old school SF Sunday hangout joint & coffee shop ☕🥐 and such... The crew needs a hand though... 😛😊🍰 …
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Food, drinks, and atmosphere were great.  Service was terrible- I asked what the soup of the day was and the gentleman at the counter said, ""Right in front of you.""  What kind of soup is that?"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Great spot for breakfast, lunch, or a drink. I am really glad we happened to park close and walk in."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Service was friendly and swift. Great happy hour rates on delicious local beer. Comfortable atmosphere.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Sat here now having a beer. It's happy hour and beer is $3 a glass! Nice music, good atmosphere!!"
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Finally! A San Francisco café that's actually open after 5PM! Their coffee is petty good too.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,Great italian ice.  Pretty subpar falafel sandwich.  Depending on who is working you might get kicked out early.  Don't plan your night around hanging out here.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,The panini sandwiches are actually good. The price for them was ridiculous! Nice spot to hang out though.
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,"Pretty good sandwiches, just wish they'd posted what condiments come on them."

The prices are relatively cheap and there is a wide range. There is something for everyone, whether sweet or savoury, and the most important thing is that it is not a typical fast food restaurant, but a place with the right ambience."
901 Columbus,901 Columbus Ave,We ordered an American coffee and a late. Excellent service and delicious coffee taste.
