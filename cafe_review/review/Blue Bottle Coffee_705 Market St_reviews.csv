Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Very disappointed considering the price and its fame. I had coffee in two separate occasions: first Gibraltor, then Espresso. The Gibraltor came out with attempted but failed latte art in a wrong-sized cup. The taste was not that bad though. The real problem with this cafe was the Espresso I had on my second visit. It had hardly any crema and it smelled slightly burnt and bitter. The taste was not impressive at all: it tasted mostly bitter with its flavor just trying to mimic some richness but failing. The quality of this espresso was something you normally get at any cheap coffee shops. I came out blaming myself paying over 4 dollars for a cup of espresso. I had very good experiences at Blue Bottle Coffee shops in NYC and Chicago, but definitely not in SF."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Always liked Blue Bottle for its sleek, clean design and ability to not complicate coffee. My order here is always a double espresso (Hayes Valley) and as I always say, if you don’t get served water with the espresso—don’t take it seriously!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,The coffee was really good and made well but overpriced in my opinion.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"- Good coffee, given it’s a chain: Really good- You can decided between two types of beans: one light roast and one darker roast - fully depends on your taste. I like it. Note: All coffees are rather strong, especially the espresso. If you’re not into that, you rather might go for a cappuccino."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Blue Bottle Coffee unfortunately was not as good as I thought it would be and it was also on the expensive side for what it has to offer.  The service was slow, ham and cheese baguette was very standard, so was the avocado toast, really bland.  Coffee I had was latte, nothing special.  Thought about buying some whole bean coffee to take home, again, just too expensive for what it is.  I may visit another location in the future to just give it another try, but otherwise, I would not go back again."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,You can never go wrong with blue bottle. It’s always the best time to tastiest coffee with coffee selections with the highest quality ingredients for pastries
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,If you’re looking for an excellent coffee then this is your place. It tastes way better than Starbucks. The cold brew is strong and very tasty!
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Centrally located along a few Muni lines, clean and convenient location. Has one vegan and wheat free pastry item and a few vegan savory items, does not charge extra for oat milk but does charge extra for almond milk which I hope they will change to free, soon."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"No coffee from a carafe here! Lovingly slow poured and served sustainably in compostable takeaways. I am by no means a coffee connoisseur, in fact, I made an error in ordering a simple coffee with half and half🤦🏿‍♀️, but after trying a cup, I now understand the hype. Thanks to team for being kind and walking me through ordering the correct drink. I'll definitely be back."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Our third visit to Blue Bottle in SF. This location was super nice and in all locations the service and quality has been top notch. Today we had Hojicha latte, coffe latte, granola and avo toast. Every single thing was super good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Was recommended by husband’s coworker. Decided to try while visiting from Canada. Was extremely disappointed that an alternative sweetener was not available. I am diabetic (well under control so I can luckily tolerate pure sugar no and again) so I use an alternative sweetener in my coffee. It wasn’t that they were out as I was told they did not do them. Only cane sugar available. I get that places like to use natural products, but stevia based sweeteners are readily available and not having that option excludes a large percentage of the population. Was not impressed by that and the attitude of the barista. Will not be going back during our stay"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Great coffee!!! This is not a sugary drink place like Starbucks, this is a high quality coffee place. Tasty drip coffee and pour overs."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"WOW!! Absolutely delicious! For the first time, I ordered the black cardamom latte with oat milk. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised! The latte was really aromatic, but still light and delicious.  Regarding the ""vibe"" of the restaurant, it is very sleek and cool! I don't recall seeing any plugs at the coffee shop, but I wasn't looking very closely. Just something to keep in mind if you are planning to work from there."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Cool place to spend some afternoon time. I liked the atmosphere, and the service was fast. $20 for a croissant and a latte seemed a bit much, but I guess that‘s what you gotta pay these days…"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Our group was visiting SF. We were looking for a lovely coffee shop. It was such a pleasant experience. Rigo took care of all of our orders so well. When he came to know we were visiting from out of town, he served complimentary banana bread to each of us. And the coffee was perfect."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I love visiting local chains and the atmosphere here is very sterile and clean for getting work done although not many chairs. The people that work here are also super friendly. while the coffee tasted great, I'm not sure if it's worth 5 bucks for a tiny cup of it.."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Great coffee shop. Coffee was fantastic. Avocado toast was also very tasty! Very clean place with friendly staff.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Love the sweet Latte - the coffee taste Is so good ( soft ,bittersweet, creamy and great smell- just like you get from the 5 star hotel."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Blue Bottle is always a win for me. Aesthetically pleasing interiors with great baristas. The single origin pour overs are always delicious. I always recommend asking for a single origin espresso! The baristas here really know how to pull the shots to give you the best tasting espressos.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,You’ll never go wrong with single origin mocha at blue bottle.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,A great blue bottle coffee shop with delicious snacks. The coffee was hot and served promptly.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,5 dollars for a ristetto over ice.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I love Blue Bottle! Every trip to SF would be incomplete without a Blue Bottle Coffee. Or two, or three! This location is great because if you’re in the area on business they’ll get you in and out fast. But,if you need a moment to relax and sit down, you’re also in luck. There’s plenty of seating and space. If your in the business of shop-til-you-drop, this is the perfect place to drop! And drink coffee!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,I got the Black Cardamom Latte and it was absolutely fantastic.  Latte was expertly crafted and I was happy to finally visit one of my favorite coffee subscription locations.  Would recommend to anyone visiting the SF area
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Good ice oat latte that is really creamy and has a lot of body. Ambience of the cafe is great too for a quick respite out of the cold windy bay weather. A couple of homeless people in the cafe though that tries to sit closer to us. That made the experience less than enjoyable.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,I drink black coffee so it’s extremely hot. They don’t have sleeves and 3 cups is not enough. I still couldn’t hold it. So not worth the 5 dollars
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,I was the only one there when I walked in. It wasn't cheap. I ordered a regular latte with an extra shot. I got a pretty latte but it was soy and very clearly decaf. Didn't know until I got back to the room. What if I was allergic to soy? Sorely disappointed and uncaffenatied. Croissant was good.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Higher priced average coffee...was not impressed and probably wouldn't go again.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Kind staff. Amazing coffee. Great ambience. We got an Ethiopian coffee and a Latte.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Good coffee, but the experience of getting it was poor. Ambience, wait time, screwing up my order were not worth the $5+ cappuccino. Will avoid this place if I can in future. Better options just across the street."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"They forgot my order, then proceeded to serve me an awful tasting pour over blend. Just go to Pete's coffee next door."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"A friendly welcome… was completely non existent from the male member of staff. Extremely abrupt, couldn’t care less attitude & quite frankly a disgrace to the service industry.  The only tip I would give in this establishment…. ‘employ people friendly staff’ & maybe that will justify the pricey coffee,  not to mention the ridiculously pretentious & sterile experience I had the misfortune of enduring at the Market St branch yesterday."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Overloaded coffee is was too strong for me. Coffee order!
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Short line, which took a bit of time to get through.  Once we ordered (oat milk lattes), drinks were made quickly and tasted great. I can see why Blue Bottle is so popular in the Bay area now!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"The order was taken very quickly, but getting the drinks was very slow. It took 15-20 minutes to get a hot chocolate. It seems that the staff is not trained and needed 3 people to make a cup of hot chocolate."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Lukewarm latte served with a stale scone…. All that aside the real problem here was this.  Of course, they have the iPad where you tip for ordering… which my husband always gives a generous, over 20% tip.  Then we make our way to our table and have the lukewarm coffee in not “to go cups”.  While drinking our coffee- it’s not busy at all, I notice a female worker leaning and scrolling.  Fine.  We get up to leave and she says- “oh you need to take your dishes.”  So we go back to the table and bus it…. Really????  Your scrolling on your phone- and we tipped and you can’t take our plates and cups.  Ugh!!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"We ordered a couple of cappuccinos and they were very good, but the bread of the sandwich of ham and cheese looked as the day before. The pastry with strawberry was really good, and the place offer good wifi connection, essential for traveller's and the place is quiet if you want to stay a couple of hours planning the trip"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,$6 for a cup of single-origin drip coffee? Excessive but worth it
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Had a pour over coffee, was expensive at 5$ but really good!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Great coffee, pastries, and staff. Always upbeat staff and quality is consistent. One of my favorite Blue Bottle locations!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,The iced New Orleans style coffee has a sweet sugar cane  taste that's really good. They don't have a lot pastries but the selections they have are also good
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Very friendly staff. Excellent coffee. Thank you for caring about your customers!
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,A Godsend for the Kiwi traveler craving a coffee experience like we'd get back home.  The black cardamom iced latte was a perfect drink for a shopping stroll down Market St.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"The SLOWEST service EVER. 5 in front of us in the Q and a 20 minute wait for our 2 coffees. Expensive and super sllllooowww. I'd say avoid and head to Mazarine instead, better value, friendly staff and efficient service"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Good coffee and good concept
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Love the coffee, treats and always get my coffee to go!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Staff here are great!  Super yummy quad macchiato and made with love Avocado Toast... I'm one happy girl!
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Best coffee chain in SF. Bathroom code is 5555.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I didn't get the order I wanted and they insisted it is my order despite the receipt they had in hand showed another blend of coffee. Never got what I wanted and had to throw away the wrong order because of bad taste. If you charge people for premium coffee, deliver what they paid for and be respectful. Customers are not dumb."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Why would anyone in their right minds ever go to Starbucks when there'd Blue Bottle in SF?
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Recommended to go while visiting the city. Supposed to open at 7, it didn’t. Supposed to open at 8, it didn’t. Employees trickle in at 8:15 and say 15 more minutes. They left multiple guests out in the cold without any concern, no apologies, no information, nothing."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I spent $50 on two drinks that were very meh, a dry tasteless ham n cheese sandwich, two bland cookies, and avocado toast that was pretty good. Overpriced and left me far less than whelmed."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"A very nice coffee, definitely recommend."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Lovely staff, great cold brew."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,So clean and good taste
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Never tried mocha before. I love it.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Some of the best espresso pulls here
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Came in and asked for a cup of the Bella Donovan coffee and was told they don't have any at this store, yet they have the beans on sale.  The restroom was dirty and dark, ran out of hand soap.  For a ""premium"" coffee place, I was expecting better.  One word: overrated."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Seating is limited at this branch and they get A LOT of traffic in the afternoon so be prepared for a wait, not good if you're in a rush. They do seem to have some kind of mobile order option though"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"As someone who cares about the environment, quality of coffee, the experience and employees being taken care I’m very happy with my experience here!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Honestly is really expensive but the waffles are from other world and the coffee is great.  Also the service is also really kind and helpful.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Extraordinarily good coffee. If it's busy (morning, post-lunch rush), it may take a bit too get your drink so don't expect to run in and out. This location has a very tight layout too, so don't linger."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Customer service is appalling, rude, arrogant & dismissive staff. Coffee is ok but I will not be back purely due to the terrible customer service"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Way over priced. Mediocre coffee and service. Not recommended. Ordered extra shots but only two shots received.

Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Coffee's too expensive for what it is. The chocolate croissant was not good, not fresh. It was cold and hard."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Very polite staff. Nice brew coffee. I recommend their Donovan.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Incredible!  Coffee is good 👍 This location is small but convenient if riding BART. …

Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I love their Hot Americano, single origin. You may try if you’re a coffee lover."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"i actually love bluebottle, but something was different that morning, at that location, which made the coffee mediocre and the scone over dry."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Great coffee!
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Superb customer service, on top of extraordinary coffee it makes."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Delicious, but feels over priced…"

Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,An Excellent experience
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,The waffles 🤩🤩 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Awesome Coffee
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"It's open from 7am, which is great. The interior has a high ceiling and a very open feeling. Located along Market Street, it is easy to use."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Very nice place with minimalist Apple Store style decoration. The coffee is delicious, but definitely on the expensive side ($6.25). For example, a similar latte sells for $4.75 at Starbucks or $3.75 at Peet's Coffee (better value for money in my opinion)."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I think this is the best branch in San Francisco. The environment is novel and tidy. The location is good and easy to reach. I bought a snow drift mug ($30) here, it is a winter limited product, I was lucky to buy it here, I like this mug very much, the workmanship and quality are good and beautiful! It is the most satisfying peripheral product I bought in Blue Bottle Coffee!  By I am a traveler from Taiwan  December 12, 2022"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"The atmosphere in the store is very good, the service attitude is very good, but the coffee is very ordinary"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"pilgrimage! Blue Bottle Coffee, iced Americano with berry aroma, well-deserved reputation"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"just bluebottle. There's a super duper next to it, so it's good to tie it up"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"New Orleans Hot. The taste was good, but the attitude of the staff towards us was bad. It was the same when taking orders, and the drinks were served, but it felt like they were made roughly without any sincerity."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"I love New Orleans coffee here. Coffee tasted really good. I prefer here over Starbucks.  I ordered a cold brew latte, New Orleans, and the coffee was heavy and thick, so it was delicious. The American Starbucks coffees I have been to have a very light and shallow taste, so Blue Bottle was more suitable for my taste."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Coffee, you can drink mellow, sweet, layered bright space coffee worth tasting Unfortunately, the coffee is served in a paper cup"
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,I ordered a cafe latte. It was creamy and delicious. They also do latte art!
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,"Here's a photo of the Super Duper Burger, and that's Blue Bottle Coffee. I ordered a latte according to the people who said the taste of the latte below was good, but now that I think about it, I can count on my 10 fingers the number of times I have eaten a latte since I was born. If you are new to Blue Bottle, just order something like Americano. The coffee is very light and acidic, giving it a unique taste. It tastes completely different from Starbucks' bitter and strong coffee. It's delicious. It takes some time to make because it is hand-drip."
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,The interior needs some improvement
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,I also liked the latte better than New Orleans. It was nice that it was less crowded than the main store on 5th Avenue.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Eat blueberry scones twice.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,The latte tastes great.
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,Beans $11-25
Blue Bottle Coffee,705 Market St,latte is delicious
