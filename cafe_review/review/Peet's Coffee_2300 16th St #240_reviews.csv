Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"I have a soft spot in my heart for Peet's.  I used to manage the ones in Burlingame and Palo Alto Town & Country back in the late 90s.  The level of training still holds true today as the milk is perfectly steamed for cappuccinos just like I was trained and, in turn, trained others.  The espresso is never bitter and the large size is a perfect ratio of milk and espresso."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Nice little place and attentive staff. I got their shaken tea lemonade and it was pretty good but overpriced for what it was (which is on the company). Only downside is that there are NO outlets at any of the tables, so it’s not the best place to charge your phone or laptop."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Well this is the second time this happen in this month were I was using a app called good2go for restroom nice luxury restroom for partner drivers to use and once again when it my turn to use restroom I did and the manager of the store turn around and open the door with the key when o told them someone inside also I don't have to because the system shows someone in restroom and it have sensor inside I was once again violated when using this app I don't feel comfortable or safe to use this app restroom period and will file complaint and and damages the k you but this app isn't for me or anyone when it comes to safety and privacy the CEO of the company told me that their not suppose to open door unless emergency with the key but they did and the restroom was so nasty I had to clean seat before using it and low on bathroom essentials and no soap. It good app to use or pay for .
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"I ordered a white chocolate mocha, which was just under $6 for the smallest size. It wasn't sweet enough for my liking. The employee that took my order wasnt very friendly either. I really didn't feel one way or the other about my experience."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"I am very pleased with this place, I ordered it a caramel frappe and I was treated like a king which is exactly what I expected for my place like pit‘s coffee and tea. Definitely coming back for more since this place very close to my place."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Just a super nice coffee shop. Great tea also. The tea comes in compostable tea bags
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Very friendly and helpful staff with a damn good barista brewing and mixing some real tasty coffee.  I had a hot mocha cappuccino on a truely ugly and frigid, and extremely wet day in what was once a great and respectable city on the bay. They were nice enough to give me a thermos full of hot water so my g.f. and I could defrost our hands and faces after battling the rain and wind in an attempt to repair our xterra and secure our roof rack storage bags from flooding as well as the window that had been savagely smashed to bits in the early morning hours by hopeful looters just hours before..."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"This Peet's is always a bit of a toss-up. Some mornings, it's staffed by a couple of grumpy youger workers, and other days the baristas are an overall older (and much more qualified!) group. The latter team always makes the best drinks, compared with what can only be described as uninspired barista work from the youngins.  It's understandable why the dichotomy exists - it also just means that you would be better off at the Jamba Juice next door whenever you see some teenagers behind the counter as you walk in. You've been wanted."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"There is one dude who works here who has a major attitude. He made a cappuchino for me but he made a small. All I said was ""oh I think that was supposed to be a medium"". He didn't say a word. Just glared at me and fling the cup away. Made another one and then stared at me as he half tossed it down in front of me without saying a word like I just ruined his day when it's his own fault."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Coffee are little bit expensive and they don’t have too many options that makes me unhappy with
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Tried their Morning glory muffin, peach scone and chocolate brownie. The first two have very low sugar which makes for a bland taste. Scones are usual rather dry too. The chocolate brownie was decent, but again it was kind of dried out too. Decent experience."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,The only bad thing about Peet's is the price for 2 coffees-- approx. $10!! I'll make coffee for myself and my family at my home !! The coffee shops  are a joke almost ALL are over priced. Except  the regular  coffee (for seniors) at Mc Donalds.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Love the chicken chorizo and cheese flatbread—nice portion size.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Went to buy a coffee expecting it to be kind of the same as my hometown coffee shop wasn't what I was used to.  .  . The employees are very kind and helpful
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,This is the 4th time Ive been here in hopes the first few were just off days. I order a large tea latte and each time one third of my drink is ALL foam.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,This is the best Peet's coffee location.  They're fast -- they can knock down a line in no time.  And the staff is so friendly.  The place stays clean.  They have just started with some breakfast sandwiches which I think are not good.  But all the other pastries are great.  I go every day and really enjoy it.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Another coffee spot. Very convinient location. Shopping, grocery shopping, bagel shop, Jamba juice. Just great."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Coffee is always on point. The staff is awesome. They are so respectful and a joy to see when you come in peet's.  I love my hot delicious mocha. Thank you staffs for making me feel like I'm at home
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,I love Peet's. It's my favorite cafe. Their coffee drinks are delicious. I like their pastries and breakfast sandwiches too.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Very kind helpful and staff nice clean building.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Great coffee, friendly staff."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Coffee is good, but place need to clean up a bit."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Better coffee then Starbucks always get Cafe latte 😋. Cafe is busy but you find the seating. Pretty neat and clean 👌 …
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Excellent & quick service, i usually stop by this peets 2-3 times a wk, they could clean up the restroom a little more though, but i do like the futuristic look it has plus they give you paper with a qr code that have to scan before entering pretty cool if you ask me once the machine scans your number the door automatically opens. Friendly employees they got at this store, a plus!"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"As my personal opinion , the flavor and the fragrance of the coffee is better than Starbucks.  This is a very busy store. The reason I gave 4 stars because of the homeless issue and the aggressive panhandler in the area."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Horrible service.  Ordered a coffee from the barista who took my money, ignored me and proceeded to take another customer's order without acknowledging me any further.  No other employees walking around offered any assistance while I was standing at the counter confused about when or if I would be receiving my coffee.  After about ten minutes I walked up to the same barista and asked about my coffee, to which he replied ""Oh I forgot! ""And then as he wenr to get the coffe he asked me what size I ordered because he forgot since it had been so long.  On top of all of this, the bathroom was out of service and they didnt tell any of the customers, they had to find out on their own.  In addition, the coffee was terrible.  Absolutley the worst place."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Very friendly and decent prices. Coffee was good too.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Very convinient location to sit and have coffee. You have different stores next door to choose from as well. Peets was clean and the service was awesome! Employees take the time to help you and they are very polite and respectful. Definitely a pleasant experience.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Sam(Manager) and the staff are friendly and attentive. Serve drinks quickly and acknowledge everyone that enters! Still one of my favorite Peet's to visit!
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,The manager and staff are very friendly.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Coffee is good. Staff is nice. But you can see the crowd is here sole for a coffee and a little chitchat. People are nice too, though they might try to sell you a bottle of perfume. The place have bench tables but no power outlets. Unfriendly to laptop. Matter of fact, power outets were designed and installed before, you can see all of them covered with a metal plate and none can be used. This place is not keeping up. Internet is still like over 10-15 years ago as with  PING 15 ms,  DOWNLOAD 5.45 Mbps,  UPLOAD 1.53 Mbps. I tested this specifically when no other people in sight are using laptops. In my 3 hours of staying, I did not see staff came to clean up any table. The floor is littered with straw paper and crumbs."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Coffee was cold, and the berry scone was dry and only one berry. When I asked to get a replacement the barista said rudely, ""well I didn't make it!"" So I went to the cashier with same issue. Her comment was, ""well it does have a berry in it sir, but I guess we can replace it for you even though you broke it in half."". She did give me a new one, just as dried out as the first. When I asked for the manager, she said ""she's on a break. You'll have to wait"". My response, I threw everything away in front of both of them and went to Starbucks next door in Safeway.  Poor form Peet's. Won't be back, ever!"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Another great Pete's outlet, and kind of a remote potrero district shopping center, but with all your favorite drinks. Starbucks can lump it. Pete's rules supreme"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,I go to a lot of different Pete's and at potrero the staff is very friendly. It looks and sounds like they are having fun. They even know names of regular customers. Good vibes!
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"They make my cappuccino right like most Peets does.  Unlike Starbucks that doesn't know the difference between it and a latte.  Also thumbs up for their use of Good2go for the bathroom.  Atmosphere just ok, a little bustly."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Fantastic hands-free bathroom experience. Once your hands are clean, you don't need to touch anything before leaving. Door will open automatically when you wave your hand in front of it"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,The barista was readily available and kind enough to fill my commuter mug with their house brew for a medium price.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"No plugs - one star, great rest room - 5 stars. But I should find another coffee shop to continue working - battery drained -another 1 star."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Service was great just don't use the restroom! Yuck!
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Very laid back place to hang out either to have a coffee, pastry, or to work. The staff is amazingly friendly and management is receptive to any suggestions and comments. Would highly recommend!"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"This location has some nice tables located outside at Potrero Center for some great people watching,  The coffee and iced drinks are ok and the drinks are always made quickly.  There is also a Noah's next door and a Jamba Juice so if anyone in your group doesn't want coffee this is a good place to meet in the center of the city before going on a weekend adventure."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Good coffee, good service, and friendly staff.  It's a bit of a rough neighborhood so don't be surprised if you see some stuff going on which might offend the senses."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Great tasting coffee!👍😋
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,I go to this specific Peets location often before getting groceries at Safeway next door. The staff are always super friendly and the service is quick.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Good coffee but staff needs more social skills sadly from our last visit
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,I love love love the smell of Peet's Coffee it's so rich and inviting. It's wonderful
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Hi I am a regular customer and I haven't been making purchases r ecently...i went there on 5/4 at 10pm and there were two asian guys one is always irritated face and the other offended me all I asked for was a hot water and if I could pay for that however he was rude to say no wr will not give anymore...worst place I have ever seen they should not be in customer  service they should do some labor where they don't have to interact with people
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Pretty standard chain coffee. Service was a little slow & it looked like one of their windows had been broken & boarded up. Hard to get to on foot.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"This Location is the best some of the same staff for over 20 years😊. Excellent, quick & courteous service. This is the best PEET's in SF. …"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,The staff is ALWAYS so friendly here. Try the Horchata Latte With Oat Milk.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"We went to this store, and stood over there for about 30 minutes drinking our coffee, at the end I ask for a bathroom key,  they said the bathroom was out service it was no flushing, but minutes before the bathroom was working they closed they didn't want to clean the bathroom. That is horrible experience. They don't need to close the bathroom until there is no customer using it. Bad bad bad bad too much bad"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Good drink. Great spot to come here and work. They even have curtains to protect people from the sun's glare. Service is ok.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Great environment, very friendly service, there are quite a few homeless people in the area but not really an issue just character moments"
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Coffee was good(of course its peets). The restroom was out of order. And the customer service was a little less than friendly.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"This Pete's is just like every other. Good, quick and friendly service. Clean restroom, but nothing original."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Spacious, lots of seating and mostly empty. Free unlimited parking in the parking lot. Friendly staff. Great coffee."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Busy Peet's during morning rush hour. Best part is no-hassle parking, as this locale is in the middle of Potrero Center at 16th & Potrero."
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,Love the friendly staff and aromatics of fresh brewed coffee.
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,No corporate coffee At least it ain't star*ucks
Peet's Coffee,2300 16th St #240,"Coffee is fresh. A place to relax, and get some work done. They make you feel at home."
