Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"We come here for our team luncheon, and the salads are so very robust and a fan favorite. The sandwiches come with sides like sweet potatoe fries, salad or French fries. And plenty of cake options, Cafe drinks, and teas. We just stake out a large table in the front for perfect afternoon get togethers."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Delicious fried chicken sandwich with mint flavored cold black tea. My favorite place to just get some downtime wirh their awesome coffee and meet up with neighborhood coworkers.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Cute local coffee shop. Laid back, mellow, down-to-earth. Barista was very friendly. I got the drip coffee and it was great."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"TL;DR: Great service, wonderful made-to-order coffee and sandwiches, aesthetically pleasing interior and exterior.  I saw the boat outside, so I knew whatever was inside would be interesting. After walking past the couches and tables, I got to the counter where I asked the cashier which sandwich he recommended. He was very helpful and told me about the more breakfast-y sandwiches and the all-day sandwiches. According to him, the Frankenstein, at $16.50, is a massive sandwich that's almost too big. I settled with the Bush St., which was $12.50. I also got an ""ice mocha,"" which was about $5 (I'm not sure what the exact price was because I didn't get my receipt.)  While I waited, I looked around. There was a nice clock and an assortment of seating options ranging from couches to benches. There was a wagon with books and Chinese newspapers, and some vintage things including a baseball and Crayola box in what looked like a handmade cabinet. There were 20-somethings on laptops and phones and one older gentleman staring into space, probably reminiscing about the past. Also, some old photos on the walls and a framed flower made of a newspaper near the condiments and utensils counter.  I got my ice mocha, which was made to order. It wasn't very sweet, but sweet enough. My sandwich came a few minutes later; it was very warm and still a little crispy from toasting. I chose sausage instead of bacon as the meat, and it sat on the bread with lettuce, arugula, onion, and tomatoes, with egg and cheese on top. It was a nice combination of flavors and could be substantial enough for two people who aren't very hungry.  This is a perfect place for sitting down for a while, studying, or doing some work. They have WiFi and lots of table space. The food and coffee are good, and the large windows let a generous amount of light in."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"cafe for the community, tremendous open space and smartly choreographed; which allows personal as well as communal gatherings served by  friendly and courteous attendants, they get it and us!"
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Relaxing place to snuggle up with a book or gather with friends. So airy, light, and open. Wonderful coffee, wine, and sandwiches with a bistro feel. Even has frozen yoghurt and pastries. We enjoyed indoors and then went to sit outside in the sun under the olive trees in their boat shaped parklet. Enchanting little corner cafe. All the sandwiches are terrific on soft baguettes. The breakfast bagel is a must!"
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Nice staff, lots of seating. Just can't justify the price anymore. The breakfast sandwich recently increased in price to $14 (and the price is not posted, you don't find out until you order) which is just more than I can bear to oay"
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"The rainbow quinoa salad is so amazing - really fresh and with subtle Japanese flavors in the cucumber and mushroom marinade, so tasty. Get it, you won't be sorry.  They were nice and happy to accommodate my 10 year old's tastes and make changes we asked for."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Delicious!  I got the standard American breakfast and it was wonderful.  It felt balanced with the veggies and yogurt as sides.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Good coffee and the atmosphere is nice. Lots of seating. I don't often get the food but I like their sandwiches.

Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"$9.00 for a decent coffee AND a breakfast sandwich that tastes as good as it looks? That's a win in my book. The WiFi was fast just like the service. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""I'll be back""."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Freaking love the food here and the service is always great too. I highly recommend trying them out.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Stopped here before the long stretch of our bike ride. There’s a bike rack right in front, coffee is great (tad expensive), and they serve beer! Food looks good too!"
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Good size location. Quite busy with people sitting, eating and drinking, but still super quiet. - almost like meditative quiet. The only noise you hear is that of neighborhood traffic.  Seating is plush leather.  Breakfast bagel sandwich does the job."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Rounding down from 3.44. I don’t mind simple coffee shop food but don’t charge me 13 dollars for it. That’s what breadbelly charges for homemade bread and the best possible ingredients. Staff was awesome and friendly though!
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"My favorite place. I sit here and write in the mornings sometimes. I have spoken to the folks who own the cafe, and they are genuinely nice people, which makes giving them my money even easier. I feel good about what I buy here, and I believe you will too."

Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Just perfect. Very cozy place and super friendly people. Bush street sandwich is a killer. Cappuccino is top notch. When you are in the neighbourhood and need place to sit with a cup of coffee - you have to check this place out.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"I only ate a sandwich with sparkling water (no coffee) and it was good, but nothing special. The bread was tasty. Next time I will ask for more add-ons. The outdoor seating was a nice part of California and I enjoyed my time eating and relaxing. Very pleasant cafe stop. I will come back for coffee or another lunch."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Good place to study. Good turkey cranberry sandwich. Also a pesto option. All their breads are ciabatta but they have bagels and croissants. They have good cold brew. The seating is spacious and mixed lounging and tables for work. Solo gender neutral bathroom is always clean.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Loved this place. Colin, the owner is so nice and accommodating. Had a cup of cappuccino which was great. The ambiance is perfect; rustic and inviting.

I will be back here regularly."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,After my run I stopped in for a latte and breakfast sandwich serve warm toasted on very fresh bread so good that I considered ordering a second one.

Prices fair for the high quality food served at this popular place.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Lovely people, nice environment. They take pride in their work and care about the people who frequent the establishment. Local family I’m glad to support and a great place."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Good place to relax with your breakfast. The specialty coffee drinks are only okay.  The cragle, while novel, was also yummy.  Service could be better if they hired at least one more person per sift - one person managing the register, making all the drinks, and cooking in the kitchen makes it near impossible to provide adequate customer service."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Best vibe among cafes in this area!
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,Tried cortado coffee. It was good. The cafe itself has interesting interior and many retro things to look at.
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,The cragel sando with pork sausage is delicious. I like the way the cafe is decorated as some seats are meant for people who are in a bigger party and there are seats for couples or solos. The staff was very nice and friendly and I'd go back for breakfast for sure!
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Beanstalk Cafe on California is a great and quaint little cafe! The staff and owners are lovely and helpful, the WiFi is reliable, and the food and coffee are good! My one complaint is that it can get cold inside and their heating system isn't the best"

Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"I used to attend here when it was a grocery market and now it is not. They have coffee and too many open seats, which is always too much. Josh lives across the street though, so it is close enough to get coffee and baked items in morning times."

Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Really great cafe with a nice selection of drinks and lunch options. The veggie sandwich came with marinated shiitake mushrooms, cheese, apples, avocado, and gochujang sauce, which I thought tasted great and was a nice change from typical veggie sandwiches. We also loved the fried brussel sprouts, french omelette, and burger. The atmosphere is great. With plenty of open seating, it's a good spot to work in or have a casual lunch. I really loved all the decorations too and definitely prefer this cafe to others nearby!"
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Quick serving, nice coffee, great sandwiches! If you're a Korean tourist, I recommend the Bulgogi Sandwich. The bread is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and moderately spicy. It's perfect for Korean tastes. There must have been a Korean woman in the kitchen. However, the amount is a bit large for a woman to eat alone, so it would be perfect for two women to eat and order their own drinks."
Beanstalk Cafe,4555 California St,"Very good cafe, great staff, delicious coffee, fast service, I recommend it to everyone! Very good cafe, excellent staff tasty coffee, fast service, I recommend it to everyone!"
