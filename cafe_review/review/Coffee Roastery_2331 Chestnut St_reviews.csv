Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Excellent place to work. Cozy enough and pretty space, convenient with chargers all along the wall and good wifi. Fairly empty all morning and afternoon so I didn't feel bad taking up a table. Crumb cake was amazing as was the hot chocolate. Staff are super nice. It's clearly a regular spot for a nearby office or apartment and there was lots of friendly chatter about families and coworkers saying hi. Great atmostphere."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Wow - this place is great.  Alex the owner is young and has done a wonderful job setting this up.  Best breakfast sandwich in San Francisco. We get the sausage egg and cheese that other owner Rose makes better then anybody.  The espresso and drip coffee is better than you can make and home and great food.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"If you like coffee, you’ll love this place. Had their cold brew black and can’t get over how smooth it was. The sweet and full body flavor was incredible. The icing on the cake (or maybe more appropriately breakfast pastry) is the beautifully decorated environment, the friendly service and the breakfast food! The other thing that stood out is how many of the customers who came in are clearly regulars which is always a good sign."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"I am a native San Franciscan. After trying many, many coffee spots around the city, I have to say this one is my favorite. Beautiful atmosphere, great location, very friendly staff, and then there's the coffee...always delicious, fresh, and strong. If you are ever in the area, I highly recommend you try this place out, especially if you are a Peet's or Starbucks regular."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Okay I did not love the coffee here but the people who run it are so nice and the atmosphere is so comfortable I had to give it 5 stars. There's plenty of other things on the menu if your total coffee snob :-) they also have a decent selection of pastries. I like that they seem to know all of their regulars names and orders are ready. Seemed like a good place to sit and study for a while.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Iced mocha is fantastic. Chocolate does not overwhelm the aroma and flavor of espresso. Sausage muffin is one of the best that I have ever had. The staffs are so nice and welcoming.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Got a masala iced chai and a slice of banana nut bread, smelled wonderful. They have lots of tables and a few outside as well  Love the giant coffee roaster in the back"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Delicious fresh roasted coffee. The mocha is amazing. I had it 2 days in a row! Love the area. Close to Kara's cupcakes, ❤ the gorgeous flower shop Fiori and a wonderful deli. Then there was this beautiful old theater across the street."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Hung out on a rainy Saturday afternoon at Chestnut street with my boyfriend and got coffee and crumb cake. The crumb cake was delicious and the place is very spacious, quiet and has two fast wifi networks. The workers were also really nice and served us very quickly. This is a great place to go in the Marina if you're looking for a non-chain coffee store with delicious coffee and room to hang out!"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"This place is a true gem. They make a quite tasty Flat White. Great atmosphere and friendly, fast staff to get you through that big ol line and get you your cup of Joe as fast and as delicately as they can."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Chill spot for some great coffee and breakfast in Venice Beach. I came here multiple times while visiting and each time it didn't dissapoint!  A wide variety of options and really friendly staff. If I lived here this would be my go-to spot. Highly recommend!
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"My morning jog in the Marina was incomplete without a cup of coffee here and a cheerful greeting from the owners. Now that I've moved to the South Bay, I keep coming back once a month for their freshly roasted coffee beans."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,This place is great! We had delicious breakfast sandwiches and the coffee is amazing!
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Many options of coffee and very good pastries at a reasonable price. I come here for the ham and cheese croissant, blueberry crumble muffin and the dark roasted coffee. Partner like the unsweetened chai with almond milk. It is a family operated business. Super nice people"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,People seem to really like this place. There was a line out the door when I got here. There's nothing special about the espresso here. It's subpar at best. The only other options on this street are Starbucks and Peets which must be why there's a line out the door here. The owner is great though. He table touches... at a coffee shop. That's so extra.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,great breakfast sandwiches and thai tea! I like this cafe because it is spacious and has plenty of seating with outlets + wifi
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Amazing coffee! It's the first time we tried it and found it to be so awesome that we bought 1lb of the same coffee beans. The owner was amazing too to share his story with us - he's been doing for last 30 years, getting coffee from different regions and they roast it 3-4 times in a week for absolutely fresh coffee! 😁 …"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Great coffee with friendly staff and good selection of pastries and cakes. Lovely place thats not in the middle of the tourist district if youre after a nicely made coffee, and a nice place to drink it.  PLEASE NOTE ..... we returned to this cafe in July of 2022. It was not nearly as nice as previous visits - possibly new owners. Atmosphere was pretty bad and not welcoming at all. Don't think we'll be back. BUT.... see how you go."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Very good coffee place on Chestnut Street. Comfortable interior and friendly staff. Coffee and food selection is good.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Great place lot of different coffee
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"This coffee shop is located several streets down the marina and offers a variety of international coffees. I ordered an Americano and Sofi was very nice. The coffee was robust, aromatic and full of flavor. The interior was decorated as though you were stepping into little Italy. Very good in price! Check them out✔"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Great coffee! The staff is friendly and good company!
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Really nice café! Delicious coffee, cake and bread and really friendly and accommodating owners!"

Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Good capuccino and pastries. Relaxed atmosphere
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"What a great place to come for great coffee,  breakfast sandwiches or pastries. Plenty of space to sit and enjoy your coffee.  Nice atmosphere and very nice owner.  Definitely recommend."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Love getting coffee and reading here after grabbing a book at Books Inc :)
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"This is a great place to buy your coffee beans. If you need the beans ground they will grind them to whatever brewing method you use (pour over, automatic drip, etc). The beans are roasted in house and super fresh. Can't beat it."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Great coffee - really enjoyed my latte. They offer a good selection of sweet stuff and breakfast muffins/bagels. Not the most glitzy of coffee shops but has a wall full of different coffee blends which is interesting to check it out.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Great little family owned coffee shop. Coffee and pastries were tasty. Service was excellent!
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Great quick service and delicious pastries. Coffee was a bit too bitter for my taste but the shop itself  had beauitful murals on the walls
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Edit: Second visit, turns out they only use disposable cups. As good as everything else is, I can't love a place that doesn't prioritize sustainability.  —  Yes.  Awesome aesthetic and vibe. I guess $3.50 for a 12oz Americano is somewhat standard around here, but for the extra buck from what I'm used to in NY...can't complain! Got some great work done at the bar 🤘"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Great coffeeshop. They have amazing coffee here. The staff are very helpful. The atmosphere is great too, as the layout of the shop is expansive. The decor is really nice too, with a number of murals and the giant coffee grinder in the back."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"This is one of the best local coffeeshops in San Francisco. Perfect for studying, working as well as socializing. I wish they extend working hours till 6 pm."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Delicious choices!  Great spot for a relaxing specialty coffee !
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Very nice and quite place to visit. Staff was very friendly, very willing to help. (Being Blind) was not busy so we were able yo get a table.very awesome place to visit. Will ve back again before heading back to Texas."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"A quirky, down-to-earth spot in a very affluent neighborhood. A mix of tech bros and writerly types occupy the table during the day. Love the mural on the back wall."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,The store offers an interesting variety of baked goods and their coffee is delicious! This is where I get my coffee every time I passed in here.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Very charming locale. It was full of local folks when I went. The breakfast sandwich hit the spot. They seem to roast a variety of beans- but it's a bit too dark a roast for my taste. Not bad by any means though!
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,What a great find on Christmas Day! All other places were closed near by so I'm glad I found them. They so have breakfaft burritos that are much much better then the chain store breakfast offerings. Coffee is great & desserts are excellent. A pleasant atmosphere with ample seating & happy staff.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Local place with quality coffee, and great food"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Best coffee I had in my life. Also really good patisserie. Totally worth a visit. If you like coffee and chocolate make sure to take a chocolate caffe latte.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Hands down the best coffee shop I've ever visited. Family owned and operated and the beans are roasted on site w a beautiful roaster.  Every time I'm in town I pick up a few extra lbs of coffee to go.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"I'm still shaking from the strong coffee I had.... yesterday! Lol, best atmosphere and excellent barista crew!!!!"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,The best mocha I've had in the Marina district!! And to top it off the staff is great.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Good icetea and very good espresso (italian way...). We spent more then an hour using wifi and relaxing after a long walt: the place is really quite, with students and workers in their own business silently. Good place for a quick rest between a visit and another!"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Excellent house coffee, delicious crumb cake, fast wifi, spacious and cozy interior, modest prices! Love this place. The staff knows many patrons by name so you know it’s good."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"The store is very cool, and the guy I spoke with seemed to know what he was talking about. I bought a pound of their house blend which he claimed was roasted 2 days prior. When I got it home and opened it I was quite disappointed. The beans were very oily, indicating that they weren't as freshly roasted as he said. They were also way over roasted for a ""medium"" roast. Kinda disappointed honestly."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Staff is so friendly. Coffee is great. I don't feel like I'm being watched here. Very comfortable, and a good place to get some work done on your computer."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Although service and ambiance was great, the taste of the coffee was bitter and not so fresh. Also I noticed the coffee was being taken out of the  open clear plastic bags. It wasn't airtight stored, which could have lead to the poor taste."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Coffee was kinda muddy and without a flavor. They don't do pour overs and brew only one kind of bean for the day in a batch pot. The latte we also got was meh. The place has WiFi and a lot of seatings so it's probably a good place to work.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"service was ok, lots of coffee and drink options but very small amount of food options. on a weekday, absolutely no vibe although the cafe was full of people working on their laptops or having meetings. food i ordered to ""have here"" was still given in its wrapping and a paper plate. i'll come back for a coffee but only good for a quick bite if you want a big breakfast or lunch."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Coffee is amazing. High speed WiFi and power ain't bad also. Thai Iced Coffee is a big energy-filled pick me up if you're looking for the second wind (or the third). They got a good Bagel and hotsauce game too.
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Nice coffee shop, tasty coffee, free wifi."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Tasty espresso, good pastries, plenty of room, wifi and outlets, and personable, old school proprietors running the place. Feels both contemporary and the kind of place that has a ticking clock on its days. Extend the clock, drop by here!"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Coffee ok not great. Staff not that friendly, unusual for family owned business.Came in at 10 minutes to closing, plenty of Time to at least sit down and drink coffee but was asked to get a cup to go ......if it was my business ....I would serve til I closed and then I stay as long as my PATRONS  stick around .... but that's just me ....I guess"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Coffee too hot, burned tongue. Also the service at the counter could have been way more polite. The lady acted upset when I asked to put my muffin on a plate and literally threw it into my direction. The guy working the counter on the other hand couldn’t have been nicer."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"They roast their own beans here, which automatically gives them much higher quality coffee than you can get at Petes or Starbucks, ect. You can buy a bag of beans that was roasted the same day = amazing."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Favorite place to start the day when staying in the Marina district! The coffee and food rock but the owners and staff are the greatest treasure! 3 years later, it is only better!! You need to try this place!"
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Sam and co. Make awesome coffee and provide a true neighborhood vibe. He always has our coffee waiting in the AM when we are rushing to get into work. Nice and strong dark coffee as well!

Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Poor service. Staff could not answer the simplest questions about the menu. Coffee tasted old and bitter, like reheated day old coffee. Expensive, even for Chestnut Street."

Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Stronger regular coffee than Starbucks down the street.  Nice, large seating area.  Not too crowded with tables and merchandise."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Rustic old coffee house which sells coffee beans as well. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't bad, but not the third wave coffee experience if that is what you are looking for."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,"Fantastic coffee selections, great food & great atmosphere. Highly recommend this little gem in the City."
Coffee Roastery,2331 Chestnut St,Superb coffee & good food! Nice relaxed & friendly atmosphere.
