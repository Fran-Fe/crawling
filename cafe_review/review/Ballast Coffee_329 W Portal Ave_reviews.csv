Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Quiet neighborhood coffee shop. They have their own beans. I enjoyed my cold brew. Service was quick and friendly. The inside was quiet with people working on laptops. The back patio was nice to talk in. There is also a parklet.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Absolutely love their coffee here as well as third cultures mochi muffins, hidden cute place and I love studying there"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Lovely neighborhood cafe in West Portal. Really the only good cafe in the area with an awesome and friendly fan base and a lovely owner. The highlight of this cafe is that it sells Filipino coffee, Barako, which is a lot stronger and robust than arabica that you find at ritual, blue bottle, etc.  They stock pastries from third culture and starter bakery, BUT they've been having pop-ups with other local Filipinx food vendors. It seems to be on a monthly basis,but their IG has updates on pop ups and collabs.  Overall a great and lovely cafe. and YES there is WiFi and indoor and outdoor seating!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Great place for coffee and you should try their donuts 🍩 Most people hang out here with their laptops. There’s is also an outdoor space at the back. There’s artwork 🖼 on the walls for sale. Meter parking available. I’m not sure if there’s always only one person working here it can get a bit of a wait if there’s a line.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"UPDATE - 5/11/23: so the wifi now appears to work, great! Now i’ll definitely come here more often to work 😀 ~~~~~~~~~~~ ORIGINAL REVIEW - mid-April, 2023 It's a nice cafe. Coffee options, whatever you may end up picking, are all solid across the board. Deducted 2 stars bc even though this would be a lovely place to work, the wifi does not work, even though they say explicitly they have wifi :( It's just a little inconvenient to have to work offline, esp when you are able to connect to the wifi, but said wifi does not have any internet.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, as I could just use my personal hotspot and keep working, but for some reason the cafe also appears to be a dead zone for cell reception. Obviously this is no fault of the cafe, but this does make the presence of wifi even more critical.  Owners, if you're reading this, if you fix the wifi, I will edit my review to 5 stars; the cafe is a really nice spot to study and work with solid coffee, after all."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Unfortunately had an unwelcoming experience here.  Found a table with no chair so I grabbed one from the pile of chairs. After I sit there for a few moments the shop assistant told me that the chair I used was designated for the outdoor seating and I should not use it despite the fact that there are plenty of them piled up not a single one of them were being used in the outdoor sitting area. I explained I like to use that chair because it’s more comfortable (I also have neck issues sitting long time) but she insisted I move the chair back and use the less comfortable stool. So I did. Doesn’t seem like the shop welcomes the customer or even cares about the customer.  Seems the high rating is misleading and incomparable to the service they provide. On the bright side though the coffee tastes fine.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Beautiful cafe. And great for working from here. The barista was super friendly and gave great recommendations for the things to do around too!! Must try the Ube ballast latte. So good!! They also feature local artists which is awesome.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I go to a lot of coffee shops and this place really stood out! I had their ube ballast coffee iced with oat milk which was a delicious, generous portion, and had the perfect subtle sweetness. I also enjoyed their well-priced vegan coconut chia pudding with granola that was so creamy! I will definitely be stopping here again!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. It’s a a lovely bright and clean space and the owner and staff make you feel so welcome. Now down to the important stuff. The coffee. It’s great and they serve the lovely Barako bean. This is a must try. You cannot find it elsewhere in San Francisco. I cannot wait til the start to sell he beans so that I can have it at home too. The pastures are also Devine. They include, dynamo donuts and this amazing Mochi muffin which I have to add I gluten free. This place is a must try even if you don’t live in the neighborhood. All the reviews cannot be wrong. 5 stars all the way!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Great place for coffee and to do work. Has a nice patio in the front and in the back, including a room as well. Cortado was decently pulled and the “medium” bean was on the heavier side."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Stopped by here for a quick latte. Enjoyed the Ballast Latte that I got. There is plenty of seating & and general ambiance is pretty good.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Rad little coffee shop.  I didn’t Think that I got the full experience of this coffee shop because it’s during COVID-19.  Stopped by with a friend to grab a coffee. Masks are obviously required. Social distancing is required.  But I will tell you that the staff is super friendly I got my coffee quick and they were very kind. You could grab a bag of coffee to go you to grab a treat while you’re there.  I really thought that they had these red little cups to that you could pick one up. We ended up sitting outside for a little bit while I drink my coffee.  The inside looks really nice and I’d love to come back and try another cuppa coffee
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,My favorite coffee place in this area! Great with a mochi muffin too. Lots of seating! Worth a visit if you're anywhere nearby.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Generally a little overpriced. Our hot chocolates were about 80% foam and tasted like nothing at all. Mochi donuts were very good although also (like everything else) expensive. I recommend the mango passionfruit.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Their Barako beans make a uniquely tasty latte, spice aroma and wine-like taste.  I would like to buy their Barako beans when I finish my stockpile home."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"This is a great little neighborhood café. Modern, pleasant, and immaculate. It has quality pastries and coffee and a few interesting signature drinks, like a cappuccino made with ube condensed milk.  Great music playing (Elizabeth Cotten) but not too loud. Also has beer on tap and is open until 9 PM on weekdays. Every neighborhood in the city should have a cafe like this. Recommended!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Good coffee plus good ambience! Love the place
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I’m normally not super critical of places, esp when young(cheap?) people are employed and the owners are nowhere to be found. But the service here today was terrible - the girl had mad attitude and she was rude to multiple people in front of us and then to us as well. Owners need to train their employees to be kind to customers."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Nice cafe with good coffee and some pastries, but not a good place to work because wi-fi is always out."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Just out of town , and this place wasn’t the best. The quality and quantity of the coffee wasn’t worth the price at all. One of the workers seemed like she didn’t care it really want to be a work (which is understandable) but I really was disappointed in the taste of the latte and the service."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Of all the coffeeshops I have been to so far, this place has got to be my favorite in SF. First of all, the space is very minimal, spacious, clean, bright and they even have an outdoor seating area hidden in the back. Second, MOCHI DONUT!!!! I love mochi and I love donuts and eating this ube mochi with coconut was HEAVENLY!  I also liked that it was very quiet. Probably because I came in on a Sunday morning. But Im sure as this place fills up during the day it gets louder with all the chit chat from all the happy customers :)"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"One of my favorite coffee shops in SF, but man they need some better wifi. Half the time it craps out, so try to have a back up plan if you're trying to work there."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"My favorite iced chai in town. Staff are very chill. Very cozy quarters with a nice outdoor seating area, highly recommend. Definitely beats out peet's and starbucks in West Portal."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Their coffee is pretty good. I haven't tried their mochi donuts yet but have heard they're worth getting. I wouldn't plan on studying here if you need a solid connection to WiFi since it can be spotty at times.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"The coffee was good and a bit strong to my taste. And I also loved the interior- it’s cozy and sweet.  The toilets are kinda so-so, but I’m ok with it."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"just went here for the first time on my way to work, fantastic customer service, and friendly staff. Highly recommend their guava cheesecake mochi donut, great tea selections when I went in. Did not try coffee this time but will be coming back! Cute seating areas for work indoor/outdoor, and art!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I loved my drink, pastry, and the lovely indoor/outdoor ambiance they've created in the shop. I really wish I could rate Ballast 5/5 stars but the music they played is keeping me from doing so. I understand that music is subjective, but the music they played when I was there was objectively bad. Coffee shops usually play nice and calming music but I genuinely could not focus. However, if they played good music I would totally rate Ballast 5/5!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I have to give this place a solid 5 stars. I would have given it 4 because the coffee tends to be on the acidic side, but that is preferential for my own taste in coffee. Their pastry selection is from third culture, so a great selection of mochi muffins and doughnuts which are all super delicious. The reason it deserves 5 is the customer service. Their staff, is really friendly, kind and caring. They go above and beyond to care for its customers and provide a positive experience for all of its guests."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Fun neighborhood coffee shop in West Portal. Coffee is great, staff is friendly and indoor seating is chic and tasteful. They also have a nice outdoor patio!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I enjoy the vibe, beautiful ""for here"" coffee mugs, and quiet outdoor patio here, and while the coffee here isn't quite my preference someone else may love it!  I realized after posting an earlier review that this is due to them serving Barako beans, grown in either the Phillipines or in a small section of Vietnam. I edited my review after realizing my ignorance - if you're an explorer, give it a try!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Barista and staff were very cordial, helpful, informal & patient with me. The restroom was very clean and patio was quiet. I'll be back like a bad habit."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Our daily go-to place for coffee and pastries. Great quiche and empanadas, too."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Kind of a snobby zillenial vibe. Mask mandate was optional and before I could say “hi” they asked me to put my mask on just to order. Okay, fine. Then I ordered a matcha latte with honey and they just drizzled it on top and since it was iced it just stuck to the cup. It wasn’t bad, but the place didn’t seem worth patronizing again."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"The coffee by itself was decent. But the milk if you need to add it, is quite cold. So if you want cafe au lait or a cafe latte it gets cold when you add the milk. And they don't have the provision to reheat your coffee cup. So that leaves one with a not so hot 'hot cup of coffee' :-("
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"New, personable staff, well made beverages, and yummy pastry - a quiet, clean environment - what else is there?! 🌞😍🌞😍🌞😍"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Cute cafe with a nice staff, but the wifi is awful. I love coming here to work (as do others based on the amount of people I see working on their laptops) but it’s no longer a reliable place to get work done if you need access to the internet."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Usually go to the local coffee shop.Today around 4:30 pm I order a regular coffee and it was not hot (a little warmer than room temperature) I asked cashier and she add hot water but still was not hot asked again she said I can add more hot water! Finally I hat to add half a cup hot water. Maybe I was at the wrong time, anyway I didn't enjoy it."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,this place was so good!! i highly recommend the mochi muffins and iced lattes. will defiantly be coming back soon.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Gluten free beer on tap as well!
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Great coffee place with lots of space and seats for people who want to relax and do work at the same time. Our coffee came in pretty quickly considering how busy they were when we went in.  They have a backyard place too, perfect for hanging out in the sunlight.  Place is clean and tidy and they also offer a Filipino bean called Barako which tastes great in my opinion"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"It was kinda expensive for no reason, the atmosphere felt kind of pretentious"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Always one of my favorite places to get coffee in the area. Decent prices for coffee that uses a Phillipines coffee blend for their lattes. The single origin drop is smooth and not acidic even when straight up black.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Lovely coffee joint housed in a SF terrace block, friendly staff, nice patio, and a great citrusy espresso tonic"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Avocado toast looks and tastes good, but it took them well over half hour to make when there were just a couple of customers. I had to go add more money to my parking meter. Asked for a fork, and they didn't have one... Then the girl cooked the toast brought one and said, you can use this if you promise giving it back. Uh? And she said ""I'm making an exception for you"".  Thanks for the exception service?"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,If you like your coffee strong then this is your place. Best way to describe the barako beans used in the brew is it's akin to a brute in a suit...it has that elegant finish that almost mask the caffeine bulging at the hems of the said refined suit. I love their coffee so much I made the conscious decision to ditch my Nespresso at home and make coffee at home the proper way. Salut!
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"The shop is clean and quiet, which is perfect for people who would like a quiet space to work at. There are a lot of space for many to work by themselves or in groups. It might seem like a small space at first, but when you walk down further, you will be able to see the many tables available for guests. My favorite item to get from the shop is a latte with the mochi muffin!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,My go to place for coffee for the last three years.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Great coffee and very yummy donuts.  Nice parklet to sit.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Best cup of coffee in SF! Friendly and helpful barista, nice atmosphere, plenty of seating to work and a great selection of pastries and healthy snacks. Highly recommend the iced latte with oat milk. Love this place."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Great place to relax to have coffee. Would gave 5 stars if they provide ceramic cups for cappuccino.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Super duper average. It’s better than the place that was here before, but nothing here is standout.  The pastries are fine, the coffee is fine, their lattes and whatnot are okay as long as they don’t burn them. Maybe I got a bad barista, but I’ve gotten a lot of burnt garbage here."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Only for those who don't like ""St☠️☠️☠️cks"".. That means if you like good coffee without the flavor of burnt cheap beans. Ballast Coffee has some interesting choices. Overall really nice place, with a clean design and tasty pastries. Plenty of seats and even some outside."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Best coffee I had in SF for a while. Very friendly staff. Chill and spacious space to sit and relax. Love it!
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Ordered a Ballast Latte and it was to die for! By far one of the best iced lattes I've ever had. I give three stars simply because the barista who was working the morning shift on 3/12/2021 with a tall gentleman was rude and moody. When ordering, I mentioned that I wanted an iced latte but was given a hot latte. I left because I didn't want to make a fuss over it but I was really craving an iced latte to begin with so I decided to go back. I went above and by apologizing for the inconvenience and asked if she could make me an iced coffee not from scratch but by simply pouring my hot coffee into a cup of ice. I'm easy to work with. I wanted to make my life and her life a lot easier but she somehow took offensive to it and didn't make eye contact and was condescending in tone."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I haven't been back since they first opened, when they sold me a toasted hotdog bun (under some fancy name) and slab of butter for almost $6. I passed on the $9 oatmeal. Plus workers seemed annoyed I wanted food. Go to FogLifter a few blocks over on Ocean Ave for real food at a good price, with great coffee and amazing customer service!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"It had a weird taste and had to throw my mocha away. Thought it was just my mocha, but my wife's latte tasted bad too.  They're usually great, but last tip was a bust."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"This place is excellent with outside seating, the coffee is superb as well the service. I highly recommend that you pass by if you are in the area."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Good place for a bit of writing. Take a laptop or iPad to be part of the crowd.

Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Decent coffee, abundant outdoor and indoor seating, complete with a back patio! Aesthetic interior, pretty good service!"
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,This replacement of Greenhouse is so much better. Espresso is the unique Philippines varietal (Barako). Shots are correctly extracted. Nice latte art. Yummy treats. Try the mochi muffin (gluten free)
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,their Ube Ballast Latte is very delicious. not too sweet just about right.
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Not great. My large Americano was very small. It was fairly good coffee but very small. Maybe they got the size wtong.

Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Really nice space with good light. Check out the patio. If you're in the mood for a slightly funky coffee varietal (liberica, as opposed to the usual arabica) try a barako."

Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"So happy Ballast Coffee is open! delicious coffee, other locally made treats, beautiful space with back patio, and wonderful people."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I enjoy coming here with my laptop when my home becomes too distracting and I have a deadline. Good coffee, good grilled cheese, but I'd like to see a wider variety of food served."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Cleanliness: 5/5 Taste: 2/5 Service: 5/5 Convenience: 5/5 Price: 3/5 Summative Evaluation: 3/5 Convenient place to stop for a quick cup of coffee. Taste not particularly to my liking.

Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Great coffee and service
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,primarily coffee
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,Great coffee ☕
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"I heard that it was a good cafe to work on a laptop, but it was not good. There was no ventilation throughout, so it was a hot atmosphere. Latte was delicious."
Ballast Coffee,329 W Portal Ave,"Appropriate but not wonderful. Sometimes you get a well made coffee and sometimes you just don't. Too bad you never know which one you would get. Most employees aren't even coffee professionals, let's say.  Rule of thumb: the chef who is partly behind the counter makes the best drink.  Interior is modern and clean which I like. At the back there is a comfortable seating area for customers."
