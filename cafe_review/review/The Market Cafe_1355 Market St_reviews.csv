The Market Cafe,1355 Market St,"A market for a variety of food to choose from from American, to Asian, to Italian food. I really like the salad bar that has the hot and cold food. You choose your container and the amount of food you want. The food is priced by its weight.  This Market also has a section with fresh meat. If you live in the city you can always stop here to get your meat. They have plenty of seating and public restrooms for customers what more can you ask for.  This place does get crowded. A lot of day to day business people eat here, it’s conveniently located on Market street and near the civic center and bart station. The vibe and atmosphere is quite a scene. You can’t go wrong with this place."
