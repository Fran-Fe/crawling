Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Cute and quaint coffee shop in Russian Hill. Came here with a friend to grab a coffee before work. They were quite busy but the baristas were awesome and didn’t skip a beat. Loved the chai latte I ordered. I also had a breakfast sandwich on sourdough and it was huge; enough for breakfast and dinner.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,I came here to get some work done before my flight back home. I have had many vanilla lattes at a variety of places and this is literally the best one I have ever had! I'm sad I don't live locally otherwise I would be here all the time. Nonfat milk available for coffees.  Thanks!!
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Coffee tasted burned and watery. The matcha latte also wasn’t good. A shame, I used to like the location on Divisadero. They used to sell half off beans every other Sunday but that’s now been reduced to 25% off, if they have them at all."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Had a wonderful experience.  The coffee was measured, distributed and tamped right.  The flavor was perfect!  Barista was happy with her latte art and so was I.  Definitely return!"
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Wonderful experience working here for a bit. They have free Wi-Fi and some good vibes. The cortado was delicious with some good service. I’d come back here again
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Amazing place . Amazing coffee. !! Good vibes. I’m vegan and they make a really delicious avocado toast..
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Cozy place to relax and seat with a laptop. Great drip. Lovely staff. Tasty desserts.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Wow....the best $11 bucks spend in the early morning so far in the city of SF, the coffee taste very good not too strong nor too watery and the sandwich delicious and it worth the wait for them to prep and freshly make, i usually like to eat my food right at the spot because i hate it when i get cold and soggy but this time it didn't, that mean they cooked my sandwich right after i order it. I would definitely come back again if am in the area and would recommend it to anyone."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"I love their flat white, not too sour and good texture. Cappuccino is foamy."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"I would recommend this place for someone who is looking for a fresh locally roasted coffee and coffee beans. They have a rotation of beans sourced from different places as well. Would recommend to try their single origin espresso. Some baristas can make pretty latte art, nod to Arlon especially."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Very good breakfast. The Breakfast Club is awesome. Coffee is great! Recommend !
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Very solid cappuccino, nice punk rock soundtrack, hospitable vibe."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Cute shop. Good espresso and crew.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Great coffee, a choice of coffee beans for purchase, nice sweet bites and a welcoming host. Do drop in if you're in the area."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,The oat milk cappuccino was very well done. Barista girlfriend enjoyed it too. She goes regularly for their cold brew. The chocolate zucchini bread is especially good and moist.  They had lots of whole bean coffee on sale.  Outdoor and indoor seating available. The interior kinda wasn’t super inviting though.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Beautiful space, great coffee!"
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Nick made me a life changing oat milk latte with a cute heart in it. If I could give 6 stars I would- what a splendid location and coffee will never be the same for me again.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,I had the matcha latte and my friend had the oat milk latte and we both loved it. The baristas were friendly and the indoor cafe had great seating with sunlight. Oh and extra star for playing 90’s throwback songs.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Didn’t expect this location to be open, but great to see this place finally be reopened. Quite a nice environment with a friendly barista. The Moroccan mint tea and the cappuccino were both excellent!"
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Good coffee from around the world. Wish they opened earlier though but not a bad spot if you're looking for coffee on the go.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,"Friendly service, excellent coffee and one of the very few places in the area open at 7 am on weekdays."
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Baristas are friendly but store keeps inconsistent hours.  Sometimes not open during business hours.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Incredible drip coffee. Huge variety of coffee for at-home brewing. No frills.
Souvenir Coffee,1415 Larkin St,Coffee was delicious and service was great. Can’t ask for more!!
