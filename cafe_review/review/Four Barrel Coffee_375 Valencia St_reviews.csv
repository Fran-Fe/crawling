Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"First and foremost, this shop is really focused on the quality of their coffee - it was one of the best lattes I’ve had in a while. If you’re looking for a place with specialty drinks full of flavorings and frills, this is not the place for you. However, if you are a coffee purist just looking for a good brew, you would be remiss to pass this spot by.  In addition their pastries are very good and made fresh daily. Plenty of seating here as well which is always a plus."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, but the coffee was meh. I was hoping for some great coffee since they make their own beans on site. I also got a cappuccino but it was more like a latte ☕️"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"A lot of seating options inside and out! It does get crowded during the weekends, so I suggest visit this place for a good cup of latte during the week. The coffee cake tasted great with the latte!  - Latte: 4/5 - Coffee cake: 5/5 - Ambience for a quick catch up with friends: 5/5 - Ambience for work or reading: 3/5"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"A coffee powerhouse. Unlike other coffee shops in the city, it has plenty of space inside and out. Good selection of quality coffee. My mocha was pretty good (I'd say 4 out of 5) - good balance of chocolate, coffee, and milk. I loved that it was not sugary at all. The only issue is parking which is scarce, expensive, and not safe in this area."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Four Barrel Coffee in San Francisco's Mission District impressed me with their exceptional cappuccino. From the moment I entered, the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel welcome. The cappuccino itself was expertly prepared, with a perfect balance of rich espresso and velvety steamed milk. The attention to detail, including beautiful latte art, added to the overall experience. Four Barrel Coffee's commitment to sourcing high-quality beans and ethical practices is commendable. While it can get busy, the wait is worth it. Overall, Four Barrel Coffee is a must-visit for coffee lovers."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I was in town for the weekend and actually walking to another coffee shop but saw how crowded this one was and decided to go here instead. Got a cortado (no charge for oat milk, thank uuu) and a cute pastry. I was there at 9am on a Saturday and they had sooo many pastries to choose from!! The barista helped me decide which one to get (thank u)! Both of my items were delicious and I am glad I came here."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This place is awesome! The coffee is hands down the best in the city and it's so fun to watch them roast it right there on site. And the space itself is great, with a great vibe that's only made better by the vinyl-only music selection.  We love that there's no wifi - it's a chance to unplug and just enjoy the delicious coffee. The staff is super friendly, and they always make us feel welcome. And the cherry on top? The art exhibitions they have on a regular basis that just add to the already fun atmosphere.  We highly recommend this coffee shop to anyone looking for a good time in San Francisco. It's one of our go-to spots and if you don’t like coffee you can still get their delicious hot chocolate. 🤤☀️"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I love the tree in the cafe. Spring is coming. Feel so cozy, random sitting inside with a cup of coffee. Coffee taste so good with the smooth milk. You can tell the barista enjoys making every cup of coffee to make it look good and taste good."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great coffee and service from the baristas. It’s pretty cool that you get to see them roast and packing the beans real-time. Always a line for restroom though.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great place for coffee, iced hibiscus tea, recommend excellent lavender cookie!! Great atmosphere to..just sit or work on the laptop"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Definitely not the best coffee in the world. I regretted ordering the Nitro after hopping in an Uber and almost puking my guts out. Mocha was bland as well. The croissant was alright, we ordered a chocolate one and all they did was shove little Hersheys in the there. Didn’t even warm it up for us. Wouldn’t really recommend this place when there is better options less than 2 blocks in either direction"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Chic, artsy, and comfy place to chat or get some work done on the top of Valencia street. Love the interior design, the name is very fitting as well once you go inside. It was cool to see they offer coffee making classes as well!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Plenty of willing patrons and it's no surprise. The coffee is outstanding. Today's espresso was potentially the best I've ever had; bitter, smooth and sweet 👌"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,deeeelicious coffee in a gorgeous space! highly recommend 😋 …
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Their drip coffee is one of the bests in the area! If you like espresso drinks, their latte is also amazing! rich and creamy. The space is nice and cozy, but they do not have wifi."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Yayyyy, I loved this place. Huuuuge space. Nice staff. Mellow vibe. I talked to the barista, super nice. There’s cool art on the walls and hanging from the ceiling. I got a macchiato and my wife got a mocha and an earl grey lavender bread. My drink was perfect and the bread was delicious. I would come here again."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,One of our favourite coffees in SF. Consistently amazing coffee. Almost always have the cappuccino. Occasionally a croissant. Strong and flavourful. Tastes great with oat milk as well. Mustn’t miss if in mission.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Barista was incredibly rude when asked if they had flavored lattes. I’m sorry for not knowing the complete in’s and out’s of your menu, I think it’s a pretty reasonable question to ask if I’m there for the first time. So much unnecessary attitude from the barista. Will definitely be taking my business to the other amazing coffee places on Valencia."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Coffee quality (clear flavor profile) is some of the best in the bay. Drip from the counter is always excellent, but recommend the pour over bar if you’re really looking for some next level flavor and insight."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Four barrel is simply great coffee. If you like it stronger, I’d suggest trying the cappuccino instead of the latte. Either way, guaranteed delicious every time.  Great use of public parklet. They’re super busy when you need them the most, but no fault there!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,One of my first loves in SF. Industry staple. The lines can be long. The baristas can be wayyyyy too cool. But the coffee is always excellent.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Home-roasted coffee beans are fragrant. If you do PC work here, it will progress."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Good coffee!  Tried their cappuccino, latte, and mocha. Mocha is my favorite. If you want your coffee strong go for cappuccino, otherwise go for latte. If you  are a chocolate lover, go for mocha!  Staff are friendly. They have opened up their indoor seating too.  Will definitely go back if I am in the neighborhood!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Nice large coffee house in the Mission neighborhood. They have free coffee during the weekends around 1230 time from. They roast their own coffee and you can see then doing it during certain parts of the day. They have plenty of  seating here and there are tables that  can accommodate up to 8 people. There is also an all gender bathroom here as well. The pastries tasted great as well!  Worth checking out!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Hot chocolate was ok. Was expecting something mind blowing from the reviews and the price point (over $7 when you tip). Tasted sort of like a milk chocolatey flavor.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Totally the top end of great coffee any city can hope to offer. Other than exceptional coffee, one will be hard pressed to find seating or a smile from the hosts or baristas. Nonetheless very professionally run outfit with the best of coffees."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,One of the best coffee places you can go to. The coffee has a distinguished and raw taste. It was refreshing. I like that they serve the basic raw coffees and not the flavoured ones. It's a roastery and you can tell from the freshness of the coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This coffee shop is beautiful inside. It is tastefully decorated and has a very relaxed atmosphere. It's very spacious and has plenty of room for you to sit and chat or to work on your laptop.  The coffee was delicious. If you're looking for something to nibble on they also have sweet and savoury snacks.  They sell mugs, beans and more!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,I loved this place! Amazing vibe and super friendly staff! Definitely one of my favorite cafes in San Francisco
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Agreed with all the reviews saying how cute this place is! Natural chic with a beautiful, simple design. Hannah was such a friendly server who made my first visit very enjoyable. There espresso cups are the most beautiful mint hue and if I could’ve stayed longer just to read a book, I’m sure I would have! Luckily their coffee is offered at other fine pastry shops all around town. But if you can check out this Valencia location, you would definitely be doing yourself a favor. Enjoy!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,I was looking forward to loving this place as it was highly recommended by couple friends who go there regularly every Saturday morning.  We visited July 23rd in the pm hours after a long stroll in the city.  The place was really nice with the wooden feel and so airy. You could see the coffee roasters in the back.  Self service at the counter.  What I didn't like is how cold the coffee/hot cocoa was. None of the four of us enjoyed that and the taste wasn't that good either. Can't say I will be back.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Loved it here - was looking for a cool non-chain coffee place during my time in SF and this was perfect. Coffee was lovely and high quality bean!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This place is really charming and it has a cool vibe, they have a lot of options besides coffee like cold beverages, muffins, bagels and even items related to coffee.  I went with a friend and we had 2 espressos, and let me tell you that the coffee was really awful, we could barely drink it. So, I recommend you to come here if you wanna have something other than coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"One of the best coffee shops in the neighborhood. Quality is super consistent. Wish they had WiFi.. plenty of people always hang out there working on their laptops anyway, show some love for those of us without unlimited mobile data!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This hipster coffee spot is a trendy and modern establishment. In the back of the cafe you can clearly see the team roasting the coffee that is distributed elsewhere and used in the shop to make the coffee they serve.  The coffee is a dark and strong, even with their mocha you could easily taste the coffee through the chocolate.  The genderless bathroom was a nice touch and a made the place seem incredibly inclusive.  Worth a stop with a lot of seating and very open with high ceilings."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Spacious, minimal, soft wood-and-concrete interior. Coffee good. Unique pastries."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Cool coffee shop with huge display and operation of baking coffee beans. Coffee was great. It like a beloved community coffee shop that people step in nonstop.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I've tried many coffee places all over the city and the Bay Area.  For me, Four Barrel still makes the best coffee and espresso shot.  Love the fact that they give you some sparkling water to go with your espresso! Price wise, you pay about a average price for a shot of espresso ($3.75) and a Latte ($5).  They use quality beans for roasting and you can actually taste the difference.  The gals that work there are very friendly.  Other items like donuts or pastries are sold as well.  Difficult street parking."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Lovely space with nice parklet seating. The coffee and pastries are both good, and interesting people are always stopping by. Local art is a nice touch. Great place to sit and read- no wifi though."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Coffee and tea was amazing. Only thing was I jad the earl grey coffee cake and it tasted day old. Ive had it before and it was super fresh but the other day it tasted dry and old. The place is amazing and the staff is even more amazing. They just need to keep the freshness of the earl grey  coffee cake.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"While beautifully designed, it’s quite pricey, has limited vegan selections and charges extra for plant-based / vegan milk.  On the plus side, there’s a lot of seating and they have plant-based / vegan milk in the area where you can get a lid, napkins, etc."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Updating my review. I still think the coffee is good here, and maybe I should only be rating this place on their coffee. I also think the space is kind of cool. But my biggest complaint is that they don't have Wi-Fi. Again, maybe a superficial thing to rate them on since they are a coffee place. But I think it's ridiculous for a coffee space that charges that much to be too cheap or whatever else their reason may be to not offer Wi-Fi."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"What a cool place. Delicious coffee, pleasant atmosphere, and super cool decor. Definitely stop at the pour over and espresso bar. Bradley gave us scent samples of freshly ground beans and helped us select the most tasty roast. It was a great experience and one of the highlights of our stay in San Francisco!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Coffee lover here. The latte was good and cafe atmosphere was great in the morning. Expect the crowd and a bit of wait in the afternoon.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great coffee served by exceptional souls. In today""s environment where there is so much discrimination, I loved their logo.."" We filter coffee not humans"". On a side note..was impressed by the courtesy and respect that one of the servers displayed to a poor homeless soul. She asked him "" Sir,  are you hungry? Can I serve you something to eat.""  This is what we all need to strive towards. Bravo!!!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,This place has a steady flow of customers.   They make a good cup of coffee here.   I prefer them over Phils.  The service is quick and friendly.   Don't go far after ordering your coffee.   The batista knows who's cup is being brewed and will wave you over.   I also like sitting at the patio on a sunny day.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! But please get some more savoury food options! My Ethiopian pour over was delicious with a banana chocolate scone and the whole experience of discussing the various pour over coffees and waiting for my drink made me feel very posh."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Let me start by saying the coffee is delicious. I did not try any pastries but knowing this kind of coffee shop they're probably pretty good. I can't say that I particularly liked everything they did with the space in here, but it certainly had a very distinctive feeling and there were parts of the decor that I loved. The little 2-person tables on the side of the bar were really cozy despite the cavernous high ceilings, and they have cool animal-head-shaped bag/coat hooks right there by each table which was convenient! Lastly, look at that latte art. Isn't it beautiful?"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Good beans, overpriced but it's a San Francisco coffee shop so what do you expect? As any sceney SF coffee shop the people watching here is good. The building is cool and art is great but why is decent coffee always so hyped and overpriced? Either way the espresso was great even if I tasted the handmade cup I was drinking out of as much or more than the espresso. I would give it more stars if it wasn't for the demonic symbolism everywhere. We get it, it's so cool to worship the devil. *Insert eye roll."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Best coffee spot in the city hands down. No pretentious vibes from the baristas. Aggressive hipsters seem to keep to themselves despite being located balls deep on Valencia st. 11/10 would work out of again while enjoying LPs of whatever the employees are in the mood for.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco. Warm atmosphere. Spacious. Great spot to come alone to work or sit down with a friend. Slow bar, espresso bar, and everything in between. Highly recommend."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I went there last week for latte, it taste really bad. Their latte was very good before not sure why their quality suddenly dropped. I want to give them a second chance so I went there again this week and ordered mocha, it‘a disappointing, it’s more sour this time! Please make improvement."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Nice decor and affogato. Pleasant atmosphere.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Beautiful bar with a design with attention to the smallest details and a wide selection of good quality products.  Fast and friendly service but with slightly high costs.  I must say that I really fell in love with the aesthetics of this place, the music, the environment and the people inside.  I believe he respects the real life of ordinary people in a particular city like San Francisco.  Especially locals and locals meet here.  It is rare to find so many tourists.  The only flaw: my espresso was terrible and if an Italian says it's not a good espresso you can trust it"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"That was the best cafe cortado I’ve had in my life, and I had my share. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, tasty beans, what else do you need?"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Coffee is amazing and service was great. There’s a good amount of seating - it’s a nice place to work
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Very nice ambiance at this location, with a very open floor plan. It does not feel crowded or overwhelming. The menu is a little pricey but employees are friendly and this is overall, a great spot to visit on a rainy day."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,They are always good
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Been coming here for 5 years and it is still the best coffee in the city. Our family on the East Coast demands we send them beans every year because they are so good! When it is fully open, very cool to watch the roasting in the back."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Really great shop but they don’t have wifi so not good for working
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Went to this place by looking the reviews and had Mocha from this place. However I didn’t find the Mocha good, the chocolate shot was all settled in the bottom and not completely mixed. Will try another drink next time. Till then It will be average place for me."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Love the ambiance Definitely worth coming for study sessions or just a casual coffee date or meet. Taste of the espresso is pretty decent would still come here if I’m locally around.  Love the service asked for a one and one and were willing to accommodate me for it. Would definitely add it to the menu it’s like a really good way to tell what type of drink would go well with coffee blends.  Overall definitely recommend coming here for the ambiance and kind service.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,This is a perfectly made cortado. Hands down the best coffee in town. The coffee is roasted daily and it makes all the difference. Rain shine or higher winds it does not matter because Four Barrel never disappoints.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Affogato is a must try if you are in San Fransisco! A silky scoop of vanilla ice cream pair with the bitter strong flavor of freshly house roasted coffee is a treat you don't need to feel guilty about!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Welcoming open space, friendly staff, excellent coffee. But a downside and be forewarned: They do NOT have or offer wifi or even electric outlets."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I really liked my coffee. I ordered it with a mushroom, bacon quiche and it went fabulous with the brew. I also love the location. It's quite the spot and the outdoor seating is a nice touch. Coffee was scalding though so watch out."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Love this place! Coffee is super fresh and just grounded. You can have some options for milk such as whole milk, oatmeal milk and almond milk. There are not much seats (maybe 30 seats or so) and no WiFi as long as I know but super lovely place!!!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Love their pour over coffee bar and single origin selections. These baristas really know there stuff and if you want to treat yourself to the occasional $4-$5 cup of some good Joe, you've come to the right place. They have another counter that handles their espresso, drip coffee, and baked goods. Cheers!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Nice place to hang out and grab some great coffee!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Huge space but very under-utilized. Pretty good coffee but in general, experience was poor. No WiFi either, and it was raining outside. As a tourist, I was pretty much trapped for an hour - couldn't hail an Uber, couldn't flag a cab, couldn't walk anywhere else, couldn't seat because there were so few tables and chairs, and everywhere I stood felt like I was intruding or out of place."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,This is a great neighborhood coffeehouse.  The espresso was perfect.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"In love with the look and vibes here at Four Barrel. Big bar for you to order when you walk into the shop. There's a smaller station off to the side and closer to the front for what seemed like pour overs. I got an iced latte and it was good, but kind of wish I got a pour over now.  You know I had to buy a bag of beans to bring back with me to LA too. If the coffee is good, I always try to grab a bag of beans as a souvenir. They have a pretty good selection of single-origin beans so check it out if you have a setup at home!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great space with awesome patio. Very chill vibe with super knowledgeable baristas. The espresso was amazing and the iced coffee was insanely good. Seating inside is limited but very well setup. Killer shop!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,This place is heaven for ☕ lovers. The Mocha is an absolute must have with excellent dark chocolate blended with coffee! Not a fan of the music though!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I took my coffee fanatic friend here, and he says it's the best coffee he's ever had, including fancy coffee shops in Seattle, NYC, London. I agree with him, and I've been to many of the best coffee shops in many major cities too. This is the place I keep coming back to."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Good selection of coffee flavors, a great atmosphere. The only complaint I have is that the coffee is beyond too hot to drink."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,I think this is really good coffee! Service was really good also. Very trendy place. Could see this place being a regular place!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Would I come back: Probably not - just cause there are so many different coffee shops around.  Value: Decent coffee but wasn't spectacular.  The Good: Balanced cup of coffee.  The Bad: The store closed early that day for a staff party. Just a one off I'm sure.  Bath/Rest/Wash-rooms: Didn't use.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I loved the experience here. Breakfast with a pistachio blackberry croissant and freshly brewed, cappuccino. The coffee here has its own unique taste just because they make their own beans here in-house."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great cup of coffee . Service was friendly. Also had a nice outdoor bar setting to sit and have a cup. Lost one star because the price was a bit more than I feel it should have been. Especially for the size of coffee. Large was barely the size of a small at most all other coffee shops. All around a great place for a sit and relax coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. Their beans are roasted here, but also served in many other places in the city. I've just tried a macchiato with a guava & cream cheese 'pastelito' and they were amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"- flat white: above average latte, beans had a rich, chocolate flavor - the latte art was so pretty - pretty spacious inside and had great vibes"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I will never understand places who keep the doors wide open on a cold day. Unfortunately I was too cold to enjoy my time here. I got an overpriced ($5) tiny cup of tea, but that’s SF for ya.  They do have tables indoor and outdoors, which is what I was looking for. Not a big coffee drinker, but the space is nice and calming."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Excellent coffee - I've had some really brilliant lattes here. Spacious place, nicely designed. Has some outdoor seating."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Love, love this place. Great coffee and pastries! Their whole beans are also amazing, if you’re into brewing your own!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Amazing coffee ... One of the best coffee & coffee houses in San Francisco (hands down). Great ambiance, but seating can be limited as it is very popular."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Good coffee, best I’ve had in the US ever. Compares well to London’s third wave coffee shops. Croissant was top notch."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I live in London. After every trip to the States I come home, have a flat white and shake off the bitter, scalding, nightmare that is the American coffee experience.  Four Barrel Coffee gives me hope for this country. Their coffee does not peel off layers of taste buds with every sip and the rough but elegant clay cup doesn't burn my fingers. I can taste the drink and admire the gentle, subdued, latte art.  You'll be able to buy hipster clay coffee cups, admire rather creepy  stuffed animal heads on the wall, or have a lovely piece of almond cake with your drink."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Nice shop.. however, they had a stand at the door, so customers weren’t allowed inside.  In terms of the coffee, it was too acidic and sour for my liking."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Americano is not that special but atmosphere and the terrace are awesome! I am going to Latte too because I saw many people ordering Latte😊 There is No Wifi! …
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Some of the best coffee I've had hands down, incredibly sweet staff, and an inviting, cozy atmosphere. I wish I lived nearby so I could come here all the time. A nice little oasis for someone who's been walking all day and needs a break for their feet and a pick-me-up to keep going."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I came here as part of Branson's Airbnb coffee tour and I loved the atmosphere where one gets to detach from the online world and immerse here with their friends, catching up over decent drip coffee served in a nostalgic diner mug. Coffee beans are sourced globally and are roasted on site. It was cool seeing the bean bags and machinery towards the back. Would love to visit Four Barrels Coffee again when I'm back in San Francisco in the Mission Area."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I Saw this place in a TV show. So I traveled from Mexico, and they don’t disappoint me. It’s a great place. Great atmosphere inside. Hipster. You can watch all the ‘roasting’ process at the back. And the baking too… I love this place. The barista was nice. Great experience. I bought a lot of whole grain coffee to repeat this experience at home"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Good coffee and interesting pastries. The place was filled on a Saturday even though they don’t have any outlets. They also do not provide wifi - this is all understandable and fine. Also on the expensive end of coffee shops but I’m beginning to realize that there are not many coffee shops in SF where a cup of coffee will come out to be less than $5…
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I'm a huge fan of Four Barrel, the location, the neighborhood, and the experience here. Stop in for coffee if you're near."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"The place is just wonderful for coffee lovers. Weekends are full of people but the service is still friendly and fast, thanks for feeding my hunger for a perfect cup! I have to mention the cups they use, the ceramic cups is over the top~"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great coffee, and super kind server. We asked her about the different coffee beans, and she was kind enough answer all our questions!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Honestly I don’t know how to rate a place with not enough seats available! The chocolate tastes good but I’m not sure about the experience
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,I took a class which was cupping and tasting. It was a great opportunity to get coffee experience. I usually buy beans in this cafe. Beans are so fresh.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"pretty okay coffee but nothing really spectacular. i ordered their most popular or signature drink but it wasn't that great. the ambience of the cafe is nice but it's a bustling atmosphere and I don't think it was worth the 20 minute wait to order plus 10 to get your overpriced drink. if you're not a real coffee fanatic who can taste the origin of the beans upon your first sip, don't waste your time. go get starbucks. your unused gift card is probably waiting for you."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Cappuccino is great, and bought the coffee beans. The latte art could be better, at least mine was not so beautiful…"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"One of the best coffee shops. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that knows their coffee. Espresso and pour over brews are always perfect."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This is a hip coffee Mecca. So glorious. They have giant roasters in the back, a slow coffee bar where you can smell different kinds/roasts of beans, a regular coffee bar. They also have a mural on their bathroom floor. It's beautiful. I could live here."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I waited here while my family went through the Stranger Things Experience (I'm not able to do that much standing). Very open, nice atmosphere. Hibiscus iced tea and chocolate croissant were delicious"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I have visited many specialty coffee places in many countries and I must say this is the best in the world. The coffee is the best, the café with it's roastery is really nice, the location fantastic, and the staff at the drip bar are extremely knowledgeable and willing to share"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"One of the best coffee in US! Cool place, nice people."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I like the friendly staff and fast service. As someone who doesn't like coffee, the latte was pretty decent and fragrant!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"To summarize this review: The coffee is fine, the service was decent, but the lack of WiFi or outlets is what did it for me. Go to Manny's instead the have a really cool mission, a great space, decent coffee, with WiFi and outlets.  The Coffee was fine, not amazing but tolerable. To elaborate, the time I went I got a cappuccino and my friend got a pour over, My cappuccino was a bit under extracted and the milk was over steamed, though the temperature was good. The flavor profile was there and noticeable, despite the extraction issue, and clearly they have a decent amount of roasting experience and knowledge. They just need some more consistency considering their baristas or just better training for them, especially taking into account how seriously they take themselves.  The service was good they were friendly but not overly so, it was a quick interaction: transaction, coffee received, dishes returned, with not much more exchanged.  That said there were a few things that blew my mind, I have never seen a good coffee shop that allows dining in no have outlets or even WiFi! The fact that they are promoting indoor seating, with high quality tables and a nice outdoor seating area, with no way to charge a laptop or phone and no way to hop on the web to send some emails or even write this review. I'm the type of person to go to a coffee shop and sit for a 3-4 hours hours getting work done and getting multiple drinks as time passes and I don't think that I'm the only one. This being impossible, or at least impractical, here I would much rather go to Manny's down the street and will be doing so from now on."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Four Barrel Coffee is our favourite coffee place in SF.  Every time we visit we uber straight from the airport to Four Barrel Coffee.  It's all about priorities and this affogato hit the spot!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,A good place to try because it is a new experience. Not like every other coffee shop you’ve tried.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great coffee with cool mugs:) no wifi has restrooms!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in SF. I love the coffee, they even have some gluten free baked goods, and the artwork creates a great atmosphere to relax and enjoy your coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Always a must when you're in sf. I love their coffee. The atmosphere is DOPE and can i please reiterate how much i LOVE their coffee????
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"My girlfriend and I were big coffee fans, so we decided to check out this local coffee shop. Surprisingly, the coffee tastes wonderful here, and the staff is fantastic. Everything was fine, and we intended to return here eventually. A very excellent coffee shop with the greatest coffee in town! Strongly recommended!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,I never really understood why FB baristas think they are the best but never smile. It’s like they hate it when a customer walks in or something?! But their other cafe The Mill they are great and very happy! Every time I walk into The Mill I’m greeted with a smile and we crack jokes. But here at FB smiling seems to not exist here and they are annoyed when some one orders. Prior to the pandemic I use to come to FB a few times a week. Sadly going here now isn’t what it use to be and they seem  annoyed that people come in. Even the clientele isn’t what it use to be. The Mill it’s like one big happy party there. Maybe it’s the hipsters at FB? When ever a businesses main clientele is majority hipster the place tends to become unwelcoming. If you don’t fit the look and culture they treat you like Leper. The customers here don’t even want to share a table with a stranger. At The Mill nobody has a problem with sharing tables and everyone is welcome. FB treats those who don’t fit the look as peasants. One barista asked be if I was in the military due to my short and clean cut haircut. I said I was for 11 years. He looked at me with disgust and said “Typical” I asked him what he meant by that and he responded with “Here’s your drink and I’m to busy to talk”. Then he ignored me the rest of my time here.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great, strong coffee... comparable to Blue Bottle, but pricier. Nice big space. Good date spot."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Absolutely love this coffee shop. The roasts are so delicious and the service is fast and friendly. Highly recommend
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great coffee, baked goods and staff in a cozy artsy space. A real unique place for coffee and a chat."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,The coffee is great! I'd love to be able to get a larger size of the drip.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Amazing coffee, chill vibe.  A little pricey, but solid quality."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Coffee and vegan donut were 100%! Nice place to sit and hang
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Sometimes the music is way louder than is comfortable, so probably not the best place to study or chat with friends. Coffee and tea are both good. And the pastries are generally delicious."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Super cool spot with plenty of room to hang out with friends for. Parking isn't the worst thing in SF. Iced coffee was amazing on its own.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Turns out it is hard to get good coffee other than up and down Valencia. This place is really great. Not like a few other places. When you leave the city you appreciate this place and its ilk.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great, quick service in a really nice place. They have a pour-over station too... unfortunately for me it was lunch time for the batista so I didn't get a chance to have some."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Four Barrel Coffee $4.50 Cortado, mmm mmm good."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Incredible coffee with an amazing atmosphere at this large location! There is public seating outside, so if it's nice, get out and enjoy your coffee! The interior is very spacious, with places to sit and relax. Be sure to go around the back of the bar, you can see the staff roasting the coffee - it's very cool to watch! Pro tip - ride your bike! There is a custom bike holder directly outside the shop."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Obscene portraits on the wall for no reason, how would a kid be affected walking in there with his family?"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,One of the best places for coffee I've ever been to!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great coffee in the bay area!  The smoothness and aroma definitely leave you wanting more. I love how their setting is very modern with a touch of vintage. There are a lot of options if you are looking for a place to buy good coffee beans nowhere else to be seen. This is a bike friendly place so feel free to bike here and park your bike right outside.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"The latte was very good, but the herbal tea was a little too rosemary-forward for my liking. Pleasant staff. Nice facility. Would get coffee here again."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Unique atmosphere and great cappuccino!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great place for coffee.. love their Cappuccino.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Best coffee I have in San Francisco! Looking for a hipster cafe? Here it is!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,I love the aesthetics of the place and the coffe is good.  There's also outdoor seating.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Service and coffee were great, but we came at the time of deliveries and there was no where else to sit, so we kept having to get up and downbas they were loading in."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Specifically cafe and roastery. Coffee and pastries are good. The vibe is very energetic.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Top shelf coffee from a premier roaster! I've been here many times and will continue to visit. Always molto delizioso!
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This is a review for the beans they sell through their online store. I've only been to the SF cafe once in 2018, but I ordered beans from them on the strength of their reputation. And I have to say: *something is wrong*. I tried four or five different bags. Single origin, blends, decaf. The only one that was even palatable was Peel Sessions (sold under the De La Paz label). The rest *all* tasted of nothing. Well, if they tasted of anything, it was the greasy, fatty mouthfeel of coconut oil. I'm no expert and I can't explain this except to guess that maybe they weren't freshly roasted. Maybe the coffee just sits on a shelf and, when they get an order, they stamp on today's date and ship it out. Really, for the money, and compared with other Bay Area roasters like Chromatic, Sightglass, Timeless etc, they are trash."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I was gonna drag this place for being one of the driving forces of gentrification, but that’s not necessarily their fault. The staff are cool, the coffee is fine, and in typical neo-Mission fashion, it’s all overpriced.  Have a chat with the baristas, they’re all cool people who usually know their stuff if you’re into that. They’ve got a good selection of coffee, and it always smells great inside."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Great cafe place. Ordered latte, it tastes soft but not creamy. Highly recommended!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Intense attention to detail! The coffee is phenomenal! The ceramic cups are gorgeous and earthy. They have classes if you want to learn even more about coffee and their specifics. Great location to work and enjoy the aroma and taste of lovely coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Just came in from out of town for the week and wanted to try something local instead of Starbucks which I have back home. The two meals I had were great, my cappuccino was so smooth and flavorful, and the staff were extremely friendly. Definitely will be coming back the next two days before I go back to Florida!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I've never been a huge fan of coffee (I drink Folger's a lot at home), but I randomly stumbled across this place while walking around in the Mission District. As a coffee newbie, it's pretty easy for me to say that any particular cup of coffee is good, but the coffee I had here really amazed and surprised me.  Right after I stepped foot into this coffee shop, I was pretty amazed by how minimal yet captivating the store was. It seems like the owner of the shop chose to maximize open space, because while the store itself is pretty large, there isn't much seating available. I found this design very interesting, and a stark contrast to many other places in San Francisco.  They have two counters - one counter sells coffee equipment for use in your home, and the other counter is where you order your drinks. At the back of the store, they have some large machinery (I presume to brew or roast the coffee but I might be wrong) and I found that really interesting.  As for the coffee itself, they have a very simple menu with about 7 items. I got the mocha and my friend got the house blend. The coffee was served in some pretty cool clay cups. Definitely the best coffee/mocha that I've ever had.  I would definitely recommend visiting this place!"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"This is one of the most well known local hipster coffee places. There are always lots of people here, but the line moves fast. If people linger, they are conversing, or reading. There is outdoor seating too. Great place to randomly encounter neighbors. The coffee is delicious, and strong. They roast it in the back. One bathroom always has a line."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Love the atmosphere - open airy with lots of exposed wooden beams. It's a total hipster Mission joint with growing-in-popularity pour-over coffee. The coffee is great quality for those who like treating coffee like fine wine. Note that if you've never had pour-over coffee, it takes a while but at least you know it's freshly brewed. I don't recommend this though if you are in a rush and just want a quick caffeine fix. The lines can move pretty slowly... I haven't tried the pastries yet, but they look amazing."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I’m not exactly sure why, but Four Barrel is the best and most consistent coffee shop in SF, a touch better than standouts like Sight Glass, quite a bit better than beloved chain Ritual, and several streets ahead of Reveille and their ilk. It’s their espresso. Meeky freeky it’s fantastic. To quote Tina Turner, it’s simply the best."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"I have been a big fan of Four Barrel's coffee since I first moved to SF four years ago. I think it's possibly the best coffee being roasted in the city. It's a little on the pricey side, so I save it for special occasions when I intend on getting a pour over or a nice latte. It's a very popular spot, so it's often crowded, and seating can be very limited. There is a nice parklet out front for those warmer, sunny Mission days."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"When I first came to San Francisco, I spent a lot of time trying different coffee shops in search of my definitive favorite coffee shop. For a long time, it was Four Barrel. Not that they aren't a great coffee shop, but what I've realized is that all of the coffee shops in San Francisco have things they're really good at. Four Barrel's strengths are its drip coffees and beans. While I enjoy their lattes, cappuccinos, and the like very much, they aren't as good as those of some of the other coffee shops in the city. Definitely come here for their drip coffee."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Very fashionable coffee store, and flavor is rich."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Still my favorite! Great coffee, great vibe‼️"
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Delicious coffee in a larger warehouse like room.  Fun for a group to go and chat over coffee.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Absolutely gorgeous venue. This might sound weird but I think they have the most beautiful bathroom I've seen at a coffee store. Coffee is quite good but not my favorite tho. Not all espressos are perfectly poured so you don't always get the same quality. However this is me being super picky. Place is great. They also have a tasting bar for different beans.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Beautiful coffee place and the coffee is everything you expect on a good espresso and cappuccino
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,Great coffee. The brew coffee taste like a pour over. Really good atmosphere at this place. Lots of unique art in the wall. Interior is wood and metal and cement kinda design. Could see myself going there often if I lived is SF.
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"The best coffee I've ever tasted, period. I ordered a V60 and it was just wonderful, the barista helped me a lot a with my beans choice and his advice was more than helpful. Also the coffee roaster was very gentle and he took 10 minutes of his time to explain me the how the whole process worked, super nice human being!  It was more like an experience rather than just a coffee shop."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"Cute place with super nice staff! Typically priced for SF. No outlets and no WiFi is kind of a bummer, but I get that they don't really want people spending a lot of time there. The openness is a cool vibe but allows for ambient noise to echo. Great to do some work for maybe an hour, but otherwise (as the place is clearly designed to provide a structural incentive to do) you may not hang around for too long."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"A local favorite, even more know that it’s employee owned. I Sunday’s I grab the iced coffee but this evening I had the hot chocolate. Just what I needed for a rainy day."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"They roast their own beans in the back area of the shop.  One of my favorite coffee places in SF. A separate pour over bar, a dozen varieties of beans for sale, outdoor seating (since the indoor seating is invariably occupied), and excellent pastries. The coffee and espresso are great.  The place is very cool Mission lumberjack hipster, if you can't handle that."
Four Barrel Coffee,375 Valencia St,"The coffee and desserts at this place are amazing!  I haven't been in this city very long, but an average price of only $3 seems like excellent value to me.  Admittedly, the indoor seating is neither conducive to a social or work environment, but I'm still very much a fan of the industrial / modern vibe going on.  I was particularly intrigued by the giant coffee bean machine that they had in that back where you could actively see people working.  I'd definitely return here with friends and perhaps take a shot at the outdoor seating."
