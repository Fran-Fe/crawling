The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"We had Avocado Toast and lemon ricotta toast. It is self-service. When we arrived at 9 AM, there was a long queue. The wait was fortunately not long. My toast was ok, a bit too hard for me and definitely not worth the price. The tables were not clean. Cheap knife that hardly cut through the hard crust of my toast. My latte was good."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Took a pizza cooking class here today. It was a lot of fun. Great environment and people, and we learned a few things about cooking pizza along the way. Had some expresso and enjoyed the coffee shop before the class. The bread here is amazing. They mill their own fluor and bake their own bread daily. Will definitely be back."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"This is a really nice place to meet up with friends for breakfast or brunch. It has a nice vibe. They do various different “Toasts.” Which is fun.  Everything has a really healthy taste and vibe. You can also buy fresh bread.  I tried the Smoked Trout Toast. Their in-house crème fraîche is really yummy, and the toast presentation was good. The dish was good - I just felt like it could have been better.  I also had a hot chocolate, however, it tasted more like a hot cocoa."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Wonderful service, delicious, freshly brewed coffee and garlic toast with an egg 🍳 simply placed in the middle, yum!! Add to that pleasant conversations with strangers who love their pets, your family, or friends and well you found yourself a perfect little breakfast joint. #enjoy and when you bite into that toast or drink that oh so yummy coffee don’t forget to stop and thank me 🤭☺️"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Great artisnal bakery with a delicious selection of toast & toppings for brunch. The loafs of bread are divine and feature a special bread of the week.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I really enjoyed my visit. The place smells like freshly made bread with many selections such as sourdough and rye bread. The service is also fairly fast depending on the time. When I went it was very busy due to a public holiday.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"great brunch spot with light meals and known for their toast. the lines, although long on weekends, go by pretty quickly but seating is hard to come by. would go again but not the top of my list.  they use neighbor bakehouse pastries and four barrel coffee!  smoked trout toast: layers of flavor in each ingredient, toast is a little too hard though. would recommend!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,A bit crowded for a Sunday morning! The line went out of the door. But their coffee was really good. I also liked the avocado toast.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I love coming to the mill. It is spacious and stylish and a great spot to watch people. The coffee is phenomenal. The bread is even better although quite pricey. ♥️this spot.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"We visited The Mill for brunch and had a positive experience. It wasn’t too busy, so we were able to find a table by the window after we placed our order. We ordered a coffee and latte with an avocado mash toast and a cinnamon sugar toast. Both of the toasts were delicious. The bread was thick and tasted great. The staff was friendly and the inside of the store was clean. I would love to visit again and try some of the other items."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I was here last in the Before Times. I felt like changing things up and checking it out again.  It's as fantastic as I remember it. I had the avocado mash toast and it was absolutely delicious. I love the atmosphere. There's a parklet outside and they have for here mugs and dishes.  I made it a point to go early because I know it gets really busy and it was already filling up
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,You cant go wrong with this place!Definitely recommend Avocado Mash served over a nice thick slice of toast drizzled with what looked like EVOO and a light sprinkle of salt. It was delicious. We gambled with willing to missing our flight in order to stop by here and have another the next day (we made it SFO on time). Their Cinnamon sugar toast was good too. I usually like my coffee with milk and sugar but glad I didn't add anything to my Latte. It was rich and smooth! This is a MUST VISIT place and its right around the corner from The Painted Ladies.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"A baker recommended this place to me - not for the ambiance, or coffee, or pastries (all of which are stellar). But for the quality of the bread which is absolutely top tier.  You can buy slices at the Mill, but the best way to experience it by far is to buy a loaf to take home (recommend the standard Country loaf or Seed Feast). You can garnish it with quality butter, jam, avocados, lox, almond butter, etc. You’ll get a ton of bang for your buck and the quality is unbelievable. Josey Baker is a legend among bread bakers and it makes sense why."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Amazing bread, toasts are all to die for, awesome espresso drinks. Can be a bit of a wait and battle for a seat but makes for an overall enjoyable and social experience. I got a cortado with oat and it was perfection!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The Mill is a very cute local coffee shop. I really liked the atmosphere on envibe app and decided to check it out! It is quite small cafe near Alamo Square park, but it feels like all the locals go there. Would recommend to check it out on weekend morning!:)"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great vibe, really great breads from Josey the bread baker and lots of pastries from Neighbor Bakehouse.  The staff taking orders are always friendly.  We did bring our own coffee mugs, and the person taking our order was super nice about it and even gave an generous pour.  I’m recently gluten free and was pleasantly surprised to find out all the toast combos can be made on GF bread. I was a bit disappointed once I picked up my order to see that the GF bread options was quite a bit smaller than the standard bread options for all toasts. Wakes up to the pick up counter area and saw the contrast between my slice and several others.  It’s great to have a GF option and I appreciate it being available. That slice was super fresh but very dense, lots of nuts and seeds and while it was soft felt more like a seed thick cracker, than a slice of traditional the mill, soft, fluffy bread.  I’ll definitely be back and want to try the ricotta toast but will probably try a different GF options next time."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,My daughter took me to The Mill a few days ago. We went back today. They carry Josey Baker Bread as well as an array of delicious pastries. I'm hooked on the Plum Pistachio Crumb Cake.  They make a nice oat milk cappuccino too. The ambience of the restaurant is warm and welcoming.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"This breakfast place has great coffee and pastries. I loved the pistachio croissant, totally worth a try! They would run out of the bakery items though so early morning is a good time to go. They don't have a lot of seating compared to the crowd so plan accordingly. The toasts are good too but I like the bakery better"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great spot for gourmet toast and coffee on Divisadero. Eat in with the cool kids at the communal table, grab a little bistro table, or enjoy outside (Painted Ladies in Alamo Square are just a couple blocks away). You can also pick up a loaf of bread for take away."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,This is a great spot to grab a coffee / snack and meet up with a friend. They have fresh bread and other baked goods for purchase as well as pantry items like olive oil and wines from local sellers. I highly recommend The Mill!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Fantastic latte and the cinnamon sugar toast is so simple but truly delicious. Love the decor and atmosphere
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I love the simplicity of this brunch spot! It’s literally just different toast flavours and combination. I got eggs on garlic toast and it was delicious.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"This was the best bread I've ever had. Had the avocado toast and the cinnamon sugar toast along with an americano, all so good. The vibe is cool, really great art hung up on the walls, and the prices are good."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I was recommended this cafe because of their bread and it lived up to expectations! We loved the avocado toast. The bread looks huge but it's actually the perfect size because you can taste the bread itself. We also picked up an everything croissant and a seasonal pistachio and blackberry croissant and both were buttery and delicious.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"We visited the Mill on a Tuesday and really liked the coffee, service and the ambience! It’s really spacious and seems ideal for coffeeshop working. They also had lots of great looking bread loaves and toasts we want to come back to try."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I absolutely love The Mill. Yes, the lines are long. Yes, it is worth it. Both the coffee and the toasts are totally delicious. The wonderful tartness of the sourdough-based breads is a unique delight. The coffee and espresso are smooth yet complex. Round and bold cold brew. And the staff are professional and efficient but somehow retain a degree of warmth and welcoming hospitality. Also, they are adorable. Get the raised vanilla donut and, heck, the vegan chocolate while you're at it--take those to-go, because you'll want to order the cinnamon toast, avocado toast, and egg in a hole. I love this place so much that I usually book a hotel or airbnb within walking distance when I visit the Bay. I'm obsessed."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Best whole wheat sourdough you’ll ever have! Also took their pizza making class which I highly recommend. Can get a bit busy in the weekends which isn’t surprising for a great spot like this.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I ordered the Avocado Toast and Smoked Trout. The avocado toast was yummy, a little oily. The bread was good. The smoked trout was really good.. I wish it was served on a larger piece of toast it was small. I had to wait about 15 mins to receive my order. Overall, both were good and moderately well priced. I'd recommend stopping here for breakfast or lunch."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I ordered the Americano... Espresso Coffee is OK... Good not great.  But they serve almond milk as an alternative to regular milk.  Breads look good but somewhat overpriced.  I was listening to a customer ask an associate about the taste of rye. That customer had too much time on her hands. And let's just say, the associate was not very knowledgeable. This place is cool with local works of art.  Attracts a very hipster crowd that likes to sit, enjoy coffee and with their good companions."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Love the toast here. It’s famous for its bread, which means the toast is delicious but comes at a premium $$$ hot chocolate & latte are both incredible too. Go early to beat the rush lines can be around the block in peak hours."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Gorgeous space with amazing toast. I got the almond butter toast and it was incredible. Communal tables inside and outside. Coffee was really good too.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Bar none the best bread in the city, maybe the best bread in the world. It’s just so damn good, if you haven’t tried it before, what are you waiting for?  My favorite has to be the Wonder Bread, I think it’s got to be the square shape. When the Wonder Bread’s sold out, the Country is usually my second choice.  Any of the breads that you get in store are also great."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Truly the best piece of bread I’ve ever had. I ordered the ricotta toast and it was perfection. The crumb texture and taste of the bread was honestly life changing. I wish I lived closer so I could buy it more often.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Love coming here to grab a loaf of bread for the week. Their baked goods are pretty tasty also.  The line may look long but it goes by quickly by their fast service.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Fav breakfast in SF. We were lucky to find a spot in the shared table. Coffee and treats were great, the staff very friendly. Ned a Mill close to me 🤍highly recommended"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great place for toast lovers. The bread is fantastic and the options for toast are far reaching. The place is open and a bit loud however you can easily have a conversation with the person across from you. There are small tables lining the walls with ponger tables in the middle. Also a small outdoor bench section in front. The coffee is good (four barrel). I certainly enjoyed the mocha. There were few power outlets so I do not think this would be an easy place to work on a computer. Overall, great spot for some food and coffee."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,This place is dog-friendly. A nice place to post up with a laptop for an hour and seek funding for your startup.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Wow! We stopped in and grabbed some toasts and Parmesan black pepper bun and blackberry pistachio croissant. The bun and croissant were insanely delicious. The bread used for the toast was super yummy.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Pretty interesting place for breakfast! Their coffees are awesome! The toast style breakfast are very delicious! Portions are pretty small! You can get two different toasts to try a variety! Their breads are awesome as well! Price can be high imo. Don’t get the cinnamon toast! It is a fat toast with tons of brown sugar and cinnamon! Not a great choice! Also, the place is packed so good luck finding a place to sit lol!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Omg how did I not discover this place sooner??? Especially since my nail salon is 3 blocks away. First of all can it get better than Four Barrel Coffee AND a bakery in one? I ordered the most delicious cappuccino and they don’t use Clover brand milk! I also had the most incredible Earl Grey Olive Oil cake. My favorite thing I ordered 2 days in a row was the Almond Butter Toast on their wheat toast that it came with. Thanks to the most incredible gal that rung me up, Michelle, she told me how incredible the toast is and how fresh and warm and toasty on the outside that I couldn’t resist. She also suggested drizzling honey and she was on point. She was a gem and brightened my day. The place is usually packed especially on weekends. They are constantly making fresh bread and you can see it over the counter. They also play their music from a record player! Love love this place!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I’ve been to The Mill dozens of times for coffee, toast or pastries. I think it is one of the best coffee shops in San Francisco. The ambiance combined with the tastiness of the treats makes every visit pleasurable. I especially love the cinnamon sugar toast. This is a great place to work from for several hours or to meet a friend. I could not recommend the Mill enough. My only complaint is that it can get crowders during the day, making it difficult to find a place to sit."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great ambience and their bread and pastries looked amazing! Willing to come back to try these. I only stopped by for some coffee, but it was the worst one i’ve ever had before because of how bitter it was. If you like bitter coffee then this place is for you, otherwise would just go elsewhere. Their latte art is nice though."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"When I checked menu, I can't believe they charged $4- $8 for a toast. But it was really great and special, coffee was good as well. Love the decorations here."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I went following a Google Maps suggestion and while for the most part it was ""ok"", I expected more from a cafe with such a long line!, which means you need to wait a while to order, even if it is for takeout. The place is beautiful, nice industrial retro style. The amount of options is more limited than I expected, very specific menu and prices are far from cheap. I ordered a muffin and it was truly delicious, but it was so small that I felt like missing some bites, specially for the price. I also got a croissant which was good, mostly because you could tell it was quite fresh, yet it was not memorable. And I got a a hot chocolate and that was disappointing, average would almost be a an understatement, they need to up their game in that field. The 4 stars are for the muffin, the -1 for the chocolate."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,A place where a single piece of toast is delicious!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Just lost my mind after having egg in a hole with sage garlic butter with a side of avocado . Ooohhhh myyyy goooood🤩🤩 …
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The best toast you will ever have. Beautiful breads, tasty locally sourced toppings and wonderful coffee. A beautiful space it's a great place to sit and enjoy the best toast you've ever had."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"My friend told me I couldn't go to San Fran without going the The Mill and having one of their toasts... So I did just that, and I regret nothing!! I'm not the type of person to usually order a toast when I eat out, but this one was so gooooood. Their bread is so fresh and good. The mix of almond butter + butter + sea salt is amazingly savoury, yet so simple to recreate at home!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Bread is exceptional, but I always just grab and go. Have never stayed to eat because the noise level inside is absolutely insane, to the point where it's probably an occupational hazard for the employees."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Best coffee and breakfast at a coffee shop.  Their hand baked artisan on-site bakery is incredible.  We loved their trout toast and egg in a hole.  Their croissants and pain au chocolates are perfectly flaky and flavorful.  The line moves quickly and they are customer centric.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Really tasty toasts and cappuccino! Worth the money! It’s really pleasant to find a place in the city with such a quality of bread and ingredients.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"great place, good coffee and the avocado toast is amazing. I enjoy having breakfast here, and it’s also a good spot to work. staff are great."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Poor choice of food and milk for the coffee. Small and quite pricey portions. Staff could be more friendly and I had an impression that I’m an intruder there. There is a lot of space for work and study but forget about Wi-Fi... There are way nicer places in the neighborhood.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Fantastic place to enjoy breakfast and immerse in SF lifestyle. Great interior, great food, great vibe, and most important great staff 💯😍 …"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I thought the coffee was decent, they ran out of vanilla flavoring by the time I got there but I would say it was decent. We also grabbed a mushroom and cheese filling pastry and it’s not as tempting cold, they’re not allowed to warm things up for you but it’s conveniently located next to the painted ladies block."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"One of my go-to cafés. The coffee and pastries are amazing, and all the bread/toast are to die for! The ambiance and indoor decor are super great. Amazing vibe!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Beautiful coffee shop in a convenient location. Double shot of espresso was delicious and my wife loved her tea. Will definitely visit again!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Best espresso I have ever had here in SF the bread 🍞 is so good you wont go wrong with smashed avocado and almond toast.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"My favorite local coffee shop. It has great design/vibe, everyone who works there is friendly, and their toasts are delicious. Not to mention good espresso, as well as delicious bread made in-house, that's also for sale by the loaf. At night they switch to pizza and booze, so it's great for all times of day. Always super full so it's hard to find seating, but the outdoor public parklet helps. Cannot recommend enough."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The Mill is my favorite coffee shop in SF. The atmosphere is always so inviting and cozy. The coffee is always fresh and delicious, they also have a great selection of pastries and breads. The only downside is the seating is limited, so I have to order to-go or stand around until a seat becomes available. Overall I highly recommend checking it out."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Favourite coffee shop in the city. Incredible poppyseed walnut babka and avocado toast. 😍
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Great place to have coffee while in the area! Garlic Knot was amazing. The coffee also tasted good. The atmosphere is extremely good. The music was nice!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Sounds odd for something as simple as toast to be brilliantly addicting but it just is!  With a wide variety of freshly made roasts, coffees, and a lot of sitting area in a friendly and cool environment, The Mill meets all your hipster & family needs.  A classic tradition when I visit, Mahalos 🤙 Only downside is the crowds and the prices"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Loved everything: the food, avo toast and the pastries, and the coffee. Nice to sit and observe/chat with the people around you."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,very good pastries (best ones I've had in the bay). beautiful space. gets noisy. their coffe is not as good.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Best toasts in SF! I had the avocado one and the pesto pine nuts and both were amazing! Also, the coffee at this place is really good! Nice location and setup, feels spacious and welcoming!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great spot for a cup of coffee and a delicious piece of homemade toast baked in house. Yes it's pricey, but what place isn't here in the city? This place gets super crowded around 10, so get here earlier to avoid a longer line. Nice friendly staff."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"We got the lemon ricotta + jam on the dark rye. The toast was good overall but one thing I wanted to note was that the guy who was making the toast was not wearing any gloves and kept touching his mask, clothes, other stuffs on his kitchen table then back on making the toast with bare hands without not washing his hands. Tbh I was a bit shocked watching that so couldn’t finish our toast. It just feels very unhygienic during this covid period…"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Omg! Here provides good coffee! I would like latte with oat milk! ! ! Nice environment and pleasure bakery smell~~~ the price is reasonable! Super recommend here!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"This place always has a long line, even in the COVID-19 pandemic! I didn’t understand, but I finally tried the bread for myself, and now I get it. The country loaf that I bought was so fresh and one of the most delicious breads I’ve ever had. The coffee and toast is also good but really the main attraction is the BREAD 😋🍞 …"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Love this chill coffee shop and always visit when in town. They offer pastries and toasts, and sell fresh bread and a few other items. Communal seating and a few benches get very busy, but usually if you wait, one will open up."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Hands down my favorite coffee shop in the city. Incredible hand made fresh toast with various toppings. Coffee is made to order and always beautifully presented. I love the bright atmosphere with the public seating outside.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great Cafe, delicious bread, delicious toast. I never thought I would consider 9 bucks for avocado toast worth it but it totally is."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"This toast is worth every dime! So good! The cinnamon sugar is the perfect mix of buttery, sweet, and salty. Excellent with their coffee"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Usual good coffee and baked goods combination in a usual SF hipster set up. In a good way though. You will not be disappointed.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Great place to visit and have a cup of coffee. The avocado toast is a must. Their coffee is from Four Barrel roasters.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Josey Baker knows how to bake bread! I ordered the smoked trout on whole grain bread -- and it was freaking delicious! Very cool spot and friendly service.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Nice space and delicious bread! Got the hazelnut chocolate toast—  it’s a bit on the pricey side but it’s SF. I’ll definitely be back to buy a loaf, they have a great selection of bread."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Excellent neighborhood coffee shop with fresh bread. Communal tables and personal ones. The adventure bread is delicious. They have some ceramics for sale. Go for pizza night too. They have an awesome parklet and bike parking too.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"A baker recommended this  - not for the ambiance, or coffee, or pastries (all of which are stellar). But for the quality of the bread which is absolutely top tier.  You can buy slices at the Mill, but the best way to experience it by far is to buy a loaf to take home (recommend the standard Country loaf or Seed Feast). You can garnish it with quality butter, jam, avocados, lox, almond butter, etc. You’ll get a ton of bang for your buck and the quality is unbelievable. Josey Baker is a legend among bread bakers."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Been going here for over a decade and the service and quality are consistently good! Grab your coffee and food to-go and take a walk around Alamo Square Park a short block away.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Best bread in the city if you are looking for clean and honest bread. Jose is one of the few places making 100% rye bread. Pair that with four barrel coffee and you got the perfect spot. But people know so it is quite busy :)
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The homemade breads, foods, coffees, and ambience are incredible. I can't believe anyone would give this place less than 5 stars. One block from painted ladies."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Bought a loaf of bread and croissant - bread top notch, has to be top five in city. Croissant was okay maybe try the other pastries instead."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The Mill is a beautiful light-filled coffee shop with amazing coffee and toast. It’s a beautiful vibe. Coffees are a bit pricy at $6+ for an Almond Latte, but I still go out of my way to visit on every trip! It’s an experience. I do miss their Atelier Dion ceramic mugs - but nonetheless, it’s a great spot! A must try!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Good service, nice little Cafe with good ambience. There is some outdoor seating as well. Overall I loved the experience and would definitely comeback again. Could get crowded sometimes so be ready for little wait, and I would recommend to try cinnamon sugar toast with seat salt it was the best I had like 3 when I tried it for the first time."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The almond milk Cappuccino cost $5.50..and it was just okay. I found the coffee not to only be over priced but also not any too great. Donuts we're good, but $15+ for 2 donuts and coffee it's a bit steep. I'd rather go to Pinhole in Bernal heights."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Great place to grab a quick bite and coffee
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The toasts are amazing, my favorite is the Hummus Toast. They make their own bread fresh, and it shows in the toast. The coffee is good as well, and it is a pleasant setting. They don’t have WiFi or power outlets, so if you’re planning to work there, go prepared. Also, it can be slightly windy even inside the cafe, so carry a jacket, even in summer."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Extremely delicious pastries, especially pistachio and everything croissants. Coffee is above 5 stars. The bread is so good! Adrian is the mood setter for the place. This breakfast and service made my day!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"They are very generous with their ingredients -- chunky pieces of bread with heaping mounds of avocado, almond butter, trout, or whatever choice of toast you make. The brown rye with seasonal jam is the most petite but the flavor is still RICH. They also have a wide selection of pastries that are unlike any other in the city, such as the earl grey olive oil cake or the Mexican cookies. Just wow."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Pine nuts tart. THIS IS MAGIC!!! Absolute must!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,They have hemp mylk as a milk alternative. Great coffee and space.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The pistachio+blackberry croissant is so amazing, they run out quick so you need to get there before 10 am to find it. The levain bread loaf is also the best bread I have eaten in the area."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,My favorite fancy toast ( that tastes amazing) and coffee shop. I've known the mill since it was a little snack in 2012 - it's always a delight with seasonal surprises
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I’ve been coming here since it opened. It’s special and high quality. But I do think the pizza slices take way too long to be ready! Just seems like lots of pizza is sitting back there ready to be served and the servers are taking their sweet time. Especially slices to go.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Pizza Monday is best first tinder date activity 2023?
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Probably the best bread in the city! And the coffee is great too.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"A great cafe to get some work done! I love the aesthetic of the cafe, but the toast is overpriced IMO and the lack of outlets and seats is why I would give it three stars overall.  I love the bread and coffee and would come back if I wanted to find a place to read a book or do a little work, but definitely going to come earlier to make sure I can get a seat."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The good: excellent baked goods (parmesan peppercorn bun is my favorite) and coffee. Lovely, airy space with great design and plenty of natural light, records often playing. Customers are fancy city folks, excellent people watching.  The bad: it's expensive and pretentious. I get that they have Divisadero rent to pay. I was willing to overlook it for several years. But after the 3rd out-of-town houseguest I suggested The Mill to returned with comments about the pretentiousness they experienced, generally in regard to the service, I figured it's time to admit it. Perhaps it has gotten better; the last guest described the service this way a few months ago and I know good help is hard to find in a tight labor market. The consistency of the feedback was undeniable though.  There are other bakeries and cafes nearby."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Toast is toast. But at The Mill they have a direct line to Jesus’ personal collection of loaves. You can’t fathom how good their coffee, food and atmosphere are. Is it possible to give coffee shops Michelin stars? Shout out to Anna for giving an amazing dealers choice."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Cute coffee place. Best for groups. It’s an amazing bakery. Loved the loaf.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,A can't-miss SF food experience! Don't leave the city without getting the cinnamon sugar toast. Absolutely incredible freshly-baked bread with an authentic SF atmosphere.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Yes. This is a 5 star place. Vibe, service, drinks, and food are all worth it."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Very laid back, spacious and good lighting. The coffee and croissants are wonderful. The toasts were decent. I'm more likely to come back for the ambience and the coffee."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"My wife and I stopped in for a quick piece of toast and coffee before heading off to Dolores Park. Gotta say, we felt very much in the company of locals and the food was awesome and quick. Must stop if your in the area and need a quick delicious bite while feeling like a local."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,I never order a salad anywhere basically but I decided to try it here. I got the “Big Salad” and it was super filling. My friend got the beets veggie pizza which also looked delicious. I think I’ll be back here again soon. Apparently their pizza changes every single week.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The best toast and such amazing coffee! I lived in SF for a few months and dream about this place between visits. It is a little expensive for toast, but not expensive when you consider that it is the best toast in the world."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Spacious coffee shop serving Four Barrel coffee. The place is fronted by large windows and gets a lot of light. The latte I had here was very nicely made. Seating indoor is available at a few individual tables as well as a large communal table. Lines can be long.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The croissant that I got was amazing, delicious and I’d order another one in a split second. The chocolate chip cookie was okay, very small for the price and tasted too dry, it crumbled when I took a bite.  The real nose dive was the coffee, I ordered a mocha and the espresso tasted burnt. I could taste a deep burn flavor and it made it undrinkable. I had to throw it away. I would have asked for a remake but I had already left and was too far away to go back. Maybe it was the oat milk that they over steamed, if that’s possible, but it bad. And for a $6.50 I’d expect much better quality. Every few coffees the baristas should taste the coffee to make sure it’s good.  I’d only return for the pastries but definitely not the coffee."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The cappuccino is unbelievably good and the bread is a dream for a European. The best breakfast spot! And also great pottery, which you can buy there."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Really cute coffee shop. They make their own bread and other baked goods. You can get a slice of toast with different spreads such as pumpkin. This place is very pricey for what your getting and they don’t provide WiFi.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Loved the coffee and spacious chill vibe. No Wi-Fi, adding to the character of the cafe."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The vibe, coffee, music was great. But I can't give past 2 stars when I find pubic hair half way through my cinnamon knot dessert :("
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,What an amazing coffee shop. Smoked trout toasts were amazing. But even better - pistachio blueberry croissant - priceless! Thank you so much for such a great experience!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"I went in the morning. It was super busy. That is not a bad thing. I did not wait too long. I bought the country bread, a mocha, and there version of a coffee cake.  The country bread was delicious. It is like a wheat sourdough bread that is bumped up a notch. I would buy it again. It’s great with a garlic spread.  Their version of a coffee cake was excellent. It was light, moist, and just the right sweetness to it. I recommend it.  The mocha on the other hand, was a disappointment. It tasted more like a latte than mocha. It was bitter with no taste of chocolate to it. I recommend that they put more chocolate in it to counter the bitterness.  The service was good. They were helpful. Overall, a good place to go."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Monday Pizza is pretty good, recommended if the wait is not too bad"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Poster child of a true coffee shop. Simple menu, fresh ingredients, open space...clatter of dishes echo through the backgrounds of chatter & ease. I sat & watched a barista engaged in his craft with such attention. Another prepping loafs of delicious goodness set on the shelving. I fell in love. The ambience, the free spirit of every individual behind the counter. The epitome of coolness."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,If you visit this area stop here for a coffee! Real espresso’s in light stylish bistrot/ bar setting.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Old fashioned coffee shop with no WiFi, no reservations, and no non-service dogs allowed. Just the most inventive treats to go along with their standard coffees menu. We went for the Trout on Toast and the Egg in the Hole."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Delicious bread with toppings options served up with their delicious coffee. It is a busy place but for a reason.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Coffee is excellent, but it's worth coming just for the fresh baked bread smell."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,A really chill place. Love the design and the sunshine through the roof and windows!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Nice quiet space with lots of room and fresh air! Good house coffee… nice porch!
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,Always looking out for vibes in a coffee place. And what a lovely place this was. Sat by large windows to enjoy a latte.
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Great space, no WiFi, friendly staff, coffee was a bit disappointing. (4/5 green stars) Hmmmm. Everyone in here looks like a model – I’m wondering what’s going on. Perhaps I’m just not used to spending Saturday afternoon in a swanky SF hood.  Or maybe it’s the prices – a slice of toast with cream cheese was $3.75 in 2014 and today it’s $7 (although it now contains pesto and pine nuts). I’ve no specific problem with them charging as much as they like if they use good ingredients – just be aware of the price before you drool too much over the toast photos. The main attractions are the space, and that it’s a collaboration between Josey Baker Bread and Four Barrel Coffee.  You know about the toast already, so I won’t go into it ;-)  I had a straight up coffee ($3.50) and thought it was a bit lackluster to be honest. Disappointingly, they don’t do pour-overs and my coffee tasted like it had been there a while. Also weird that it seemed a little over-roasted and bitter, considering that they don’t do dark roasts. It’s still a little better than average coffee – it’s just that I have high expectations because of the reputation. They just got new coffee mugs – beautiful stoneware made locally by Sven Ceramics. The space is very pretty - nicely laid out with individual tables, a long communal table, and lots of floor space. Good music playing too. No WiFi but it’s still a place where you can hang out with a book or laptop and not feel like an oddball.  I’m also giving them 4/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact based on these reasons:  Positives: • Four Barrel recently switched to compostable coffee bags. • Bread is made from organic grain, often local. • On their blog they mention covering health insurance for staff. • Mostly vegetarian menu. • Their milk is from St. Benoit, an organic farm in Sonoma that (re)uses glass bottles. • Coffee is sourced by direct trade partnerships, documented on the Four Barrel site. • They use real glasses for water rather than plastic. • Nice locally made ceramics.  Room for Improvement:  • Four Barrel doesn’t publish prices paid for green coffee. On their site they say “it would be an impossible waste of time for us to use one phrase to describe how and why we buy the coffees that we do.” This is understandable on one hand but also a bit of a cop out. They should at least try to be more transparent.  • Similarly, they generally don’t discuss environmental conditions of the farms they source from. It’s nice to see photos of the farmers but it would be good to see more photos of the farms themselves, with more discussion on things like percentage shade cover and sustainability.  • A lot of their toast is sold to go, in a tray with a plastic lid. It’s probably compostable (I didn’t get a chance to check) but it does seem a bit of a shame to sell something like toast and package it in a plastic box – they could have gone with cardboard but I think they want to show off how pretty the toast looks. So I’m a bit disappointed there that they are choosing form (marketing) over environmental impact. Of course, you can always have your toast for there and forgo the box.

The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"The atmosphere here is chill. Gives you that, step back and relax feeling. Relax outside or inside with the natural sunlight, coming through the glass windowed wall. The tunes were uppity/chill, if that makes sense. Took a bit to get a piece of toast with jam. Tasted like toast with jam. Great bread.  Come here for the atmosphere and coffee. Chillax, listen to the tunes and smile."
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Really lame that they don’t do drip coffee refills, drip coffee is almost $5… Sightglass always refills unlimited"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Drip coffee was quite good! The person at the register said they have a ""fancy high tech drip machine"" that's as good or better than pour over in his opinion. Cortado was brewed a little weakly. Based on how it tasted I'm guessing the grind size was too large, but it was alright. Got lemon ricotta toast on rye (awesome, I don't know what the jam was but it was fantastic) and the salted almond butter on country bread (bread was awesome, almond butter was standard and nothing particularly special). Prices are your usual SF prices for fancy toast and fancy coffee. Shop was very cute, had lots of nice indoor space to sit, and there was lovely outdoor seating. There's a lot of room to park yourself, for a small coffee shop. The person at the register was super friendly and kind.  We ordered avocado toast at first and he came outside to tell us that they were out, offer us a replacement, and comp our order! Super nice!"
The Mill,736 Divisadero St,"Favorite coffee shop & bakery in the area. This is the shop that taught me to bake bread! There’s really two shops combined here: four barrel coffee and Josey the baker bread. The staff is kind and the coffee & food is best in the city IMO. Seating is usually available too. Because of its greatness, the mill is very busy on weekend mornings, with a line out the door common. It’s also not cheap by any means, though I think it’s a unique spot that’s worth it."
