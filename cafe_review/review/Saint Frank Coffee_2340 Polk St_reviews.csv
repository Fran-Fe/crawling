Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"very aesthetic cafe and look wise it is perfect. coffee is not my favorite, tastes exactly like blue bottle coffee which i know a lot of people like. However, I would definitely return for their lavender matcha latte with oatmilk— it was amazing. staff was also super friendly"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"We were looking for a nice coffee place to sit down and read. This was the perfect place. The filter coffee (medium roast) was delicious and they gave it to us in a mug. I appreciate places that are eco-friendly. The atmosphere is also very nice and minimalist. The baristas are very friendly. The prices are average, filter coffee is $4. I tried the chocolate croissant and it was just ok. I think it would taste better if they heated it up. Overall, it was a nice experience."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"place had really good vibes, a nice spot to grab a drink and just chill on a sunday morning. however, i didn’t like the macadamia nut milk at all. it made my flat white taste bitter and want to try it with whole milk next time to give a proper review of the cafe.  pastries are from craftsman & wolves. the chocolate croissant was tasty but lacked that slight crunchy croissant texture i enjoy  update 2/24/23: flat white with whole milk was delicious"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Coffee is always top notch. Good selection of single-origins, and a fantastic Espresso Tonic. Friendly service every time. Not cheap, but for high end specialty coffee, worth every penny."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Coffee flight was a cool experience! This is a real deal coffee shop where the true taste of coffee is celebrated! If you’re looking for a latte with different syrup flavors you won’t find it here! Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. We walked to Lombard street after enjoying our coffee
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Such a cute and aesthetic cafe. Has amazing iced chai. One of my favorites as you can really taste the spices but it’s not overpowering.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,All the other coffee places on Polk on Sunday were pretty quiet so we were lured by the long line to go into Saint Frank. The 2 front counter staff were unfriendly and had bad attitude when we asked a couple simple questions placing our order. The hot coffee and other drink orders were nothing special at all the cold/ iced drinks actually very bad. We quickly pushed through the crowd and will never go back. Overrated mess. I’m sure the other places on Polk are better. Even Starbucks a block away is 100% better than the drinks we could barely drink at Saint Frank.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Some of the best coffee I’ve ever had! The iced mocha was delicious, highly recommend. Super friendly staff, quick and efficient service with a very bright, airy atmosphere."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"One of the best coffees in SF! Went there during a long weekend, the store was super busy. However, the staff are efficient and we got our coffee in 2mins.  Tried their cappuccino and Pour over. Pour-over is a bit expensive and has long wait but it’s totally worth it. You can feel the smoothness and all hints of flavors, if you are a coffee lover, you should try their pour-over. The cappuccino had well balanced flavor and  had a buttery finish. Totally loved it!  It’s definitely worth trying their coffee, if you are in the city."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"It's hard to find good coffee in San Francisco. There are many small coffee shops, many of them claim to serve specialty coffee. But at least in my opinion, this is only a label in order to charge a premium for pretty standard coffee. Saint Frank is different. You can discuss with the baristas there, they know their craft. You can chose from several beans, but I decided to go with a recommendation by the barista. My pour over was served with a small card describing the origin and the characteristics of the coffee I am about to enjoy. And I wasn't disappointed: the coffee was great, intense taste, very clean, fruity but not too much. Also the cappuccino my girlfriend had was good. A bit too much milk, but still good. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in SF."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Awesome coffee experience... Well worth the wait in line - which went super quickly dispite being long enough to start outside. In a city over saturated with coffee shops, this one is the real deal... first and most important, the coffee was excellent... my husband's mocha was just the right chocolate, just the right sweet and the milk texture was spot on for a mocha... and my latte was textbook perfect, but elevated - I can't describe just how right the milk texture was, but bravo! So glad to have had a great cup of coffee on this trip to San Francisco, and will be back next time we pass through and will be recommending Saint Frank Coffee as a must try in SF!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice coffee and crab! Also the Song tea! I love this fork st. mood!! Road parking is easy but less lot.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Amazing, you have to have a coffee flight. I added a photo but was so excited to try the drinks that I didn't take the picture before diving in 🙄Espresso, cortado, pour over and iced coffee in one go. I highly recommend it (keep your defibrillator nearby) ...  And now the second time around it's still going good. (And a proper pic for you this time!)"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I went since there was hype, but I was just disappointed. I feel like if I ordered something different my review would be more positive but I am going based off what I ordered.  I was recommended the Orange Cream Latte and it was very orange tasting. It was too much orange. So much orange that it stained my mouth with orange taste and flavor for more then 24hrs.  It was disgusting because of this."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Absolutely delicious coffee. I loved pumpkin spice latter. Probably the most delicious I ever had. Nice place to sit and relax. Deserts were vegan and gluten free and delicious too. Very kind staff. Will definitely come again soon.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The coffee and the cookie were good, but there was no place to sit, since lots of lazy people stay there occupying the tables after they have a coffee. So the experience was not good for the price paid ($11)."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Was surprised to find a line extending out the door at 9 am on a Saturday, but it looked like most people just grabbed a drink to go and I was able to find seats once I got into the coffee shop. I ordered the Orange Cream Latte (their seasonal drink) with macadamia milk, and it was slightly too sweet for me but it might be worth it for others. This coffee shop is on the expensive end - the total came out to about $8.50 for this cup of coffee."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Very chill despite being busy, great tasting coffee, definitely the best I've had in SF. I recommend picking one of the pot overs with tasting notes that match your preference and you won't be disappointed!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great place! Good service and nice spots to sit and do work. They didn’t have a vanilla flavor for my latte, but i got the simple syrup which tastes similar. The WiFi was free on the weekday, but a bit slow. Overall, nice place!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great customer service. I appreciate  Giselle for her support with my latte. I was having trouble with my payment but she patiently and kindly supported me and we were able to figure it out. Plus the latte was delicious!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Excellent coffee, but I won’t rate the place higher than 3 stars since when I asked whether  it was possible to charge my phone whilst me and my husband are enjoying a cup of coffee and a dessert I got no for an answer (we had already ordered and paid when I asked). We spent the entire day exploring SF and both of our phones and power banks were dead, and we still had to get back to our accommodation  using Google maps and the MUNI-app. Whilst I realize that no one is obliged to say “yes” to a request like that of mine, it’s a matter  of humanity."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,I wanted to like it more than I did. Bit of a pretentious vibe and uncomfortable seating. It’s good coffee (and for the price it’d better be) so I won’t dock it too much but the place just doesn’t add up to that great coffee house experience.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Saint frank is THE spot to stop if you want a sublime coffee experience. Knowledgeable baristas, a rotating single origin espresso option and pastries TO. DIE. FOR.  The other big name roasters in town have been roasting good coffee for years but it's hard to keep well trained baristas on the bar at big shops like these, saint frank doesn't take their eye off the ball and they absolutely earn their rank at the top of the charts for coffee in SF."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"A beautiful airy coffee shop with the best of coffee drinks. Not to be missed if one is anywhere near Polk and Broadway intersections. The baristas are cheerful much like the ambiance and there is good seating. Talking about the seating, it is not at all crammed like one would encounter at other coffee shops in the area, and that adds a lot to the experience of a great time over coffee. Full marks!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Fantastic coffee here and love the vibes
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"We couldn’t sit either outside or inside because the place was so packed. However, the coffee is so good; I ordered maple latte. I really like the interior."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Coffee and service were both good. Interior is minimalistic and clean.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Service and mission based on St Francis of Assisi. Joshua told me I'm not a burden and this was part of the experience of Saint Frank when I tried to let someone go ahead of me because I had so many questions. Amazing service, mission and coffee."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The coffee is delicious and the service is fast and reliable. The space is nice but maybe could be a bit better distributed to make it more warm inside. The outdoor little terrace is lovely to see life go through in the SF streets. They have an awesome capuccino and fair trade coffees from many South American countries.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"As a dark roast fan, this place didn’t do it for me. Although they claim to have a dark roast, it’s really a medium roast. I also wish they had soy milk or Oatly. The homemade nut milk didn’t work well in the latte and the minor figures oat milk was not gluten free. The service is a bit transactional and not very friendly."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Very tasty. The line goes pretty quick. Lots of seating inside.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great coffee, great setting and great staff. We went for a quick stop, felt really welcoming and warm in light spacious area. Locals and tourist easily blend."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"oat milk latte was delicious. also get the blueberry lemon curd muffin, so yummy!!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Their selection and variety of coffee is great. The coffee I had was amazing but most of all, the barista was super attentive. He made sure to ask questions and double checked my order. This is the level of service that brought this place to its reputation. I would definitely get my beans from here if I lived in SF. The place looks really minimalist."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"the worst cortada i have ever had. i had a cortada made with the burundi espresso beans and oat milk and it was just awful. tasted like used coffee grounds. tamp harder or grind finer and clean your portafilters and grinder or get fresher beans or something.. YUCK. i am not sure why mine was so awful as it seems like they have good beans and i have had their coffee at ""the coffee movement"" café and it was good there in a piccolo with the same oat milk..... the space it nice with a high ceiling and the baristas are very friendly.. the customers are the most boring typical socially insecure hide-behind-the laptap addicts... .. what happened to being social at a café. .... overall.. tamp/grind correctly, clean your machines, and put a time limit on laptops..."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Probably the best coffee in San Francisco.  I had the almond macadamia milk and it was really good. The design of this place is open and chilled. Really good to sit for a while and gather your thoughts  Does still tend to have the big problem a lot of SF coffee shops do....mac books everywhere!!!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,This is the best coffee shop in San Francisco and the entire United States! you will not find better quality or customer service anywhere!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Good coffee but I didn’t think it was exceptional. I got the Christmas special drip coffee and my friend got the maple and pine latte which he loved. The vibes are really nice and it’s a great local spot which is why I’ll definitely be coming back. One thing to note is that the line is usually super long but goes by quickly!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Amazing coffee. One of the best single origins pour overs ive had in awhile. Lovely simple and modern layout. The wifi is absolutely terrible though… like the worst coffee shop wifi ive had in awhile
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,This place is a nice coffee shop to sit in with a lot of aesthetic tables and chairs. I actually don't really like their macadamia almond milk with their chai latte - it tasted quite bitter. I did like how many tables there are and it's good for working. But there are no outlets which makes it hard to stay for an extended period of time.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"One of my favorite pieces of chocolate cake, found in a small coffee shop in San Francisco. It's like a surreal dream."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"One of the people behind the counter was particularly rude with me, and it doesn't seem to be a unique experience. I got a cappuccino but personally I found their beans to be very fruity/acidic. Not my favorite but that's on personal taste, however the acidity of the coffee didn't mix well with the fatness of macadamia milk."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Beautiful space with skylights, amplifying sunshine on even the most cloudy days. High quality coffee offering and interesting customers too (one with pig pet)."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The coffeewas well executed. The flavor was chocolatey and bitter like dark chocolate with orange and macadamia nut. The macadamia nut milk is sustainable and resources but does not hold up well as a binder for the espresso. The latte foam was perfect but after a few sips, there coffee became watery and biter. Service was 10/10! Kim was very focused, funny."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Their americanos taste like someone made hot filter coffee, chucked it in ice to cool it down, added more ice, and let it sit in the sun for 30 minutes. To say the least, diluted."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Saint Frank is one of San Francisco’s top coffee spots. With an inventory of single origin beans drawn from the best lots in Central and South America, it’s a coffee bar with a beautiful aesthetic, with a warm inviting ambiance. While there is a great buzz on the weekends, my tip is to visit during the week to sample a variety of coffee making methods, including hand filtered coffee."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"This coffee shop is super local. Started by a former teacher, Saint Frank is working with small coffee growers and small local purveyors of tea for their beverage selection. They make (!) their own macadamia nut milk. Local bakeries provide their pastries & sweets. Keeping the Russian Hill crowd with their well traveled tastes caffeinated is challenging. It’s beverages are a bit pricey. Can Saint Frank’s hold it’s own against the big coffee chains down the street? As a small business trying to keep going as most are, they are! If you can stop by for a drink or snack, do it!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Wow, it took the guy less than a min to make this amazing latte. It was amazing and at the perfect temperature. The inside is nice and bright.  Great customer service and attention to detail. They have a seasonal latte."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Trendy coffee shop on Polk Street with a lively ambience. I ordered a Latte with their house-made almond milk and macadamia milk and it was overwhelming. The first sip was all macadamia milk, seemed like there wasn't any coffee in it. I mixed it around and all you could taste was the nut milk, which is unfortunate. Might have to go back to try a plain cappuccino, but this was a disappointing experience."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,My go-to coffee place anytime I come to SF. Excellent latte made with real skill and quality beans.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Oh man! One of the best coffee ☕️ shop in the San Francisco. Never had this great coffee before. Their coffee is like wine  🍷. You pour into small glass, smell and sip it to enjoy it’s aroma and flavor. They source their coffee very carefully. Every sip of their coffee was great. Must go place if you are coffee lover. …"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,the single origin espresso is mighty good.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Clean, high ceilings, bright and white.  Good service and I tried the Cortado which is an equal mix of warm milk and expresso.  They didn't have the spicy apple caramel flavor but at least I saved some calories!   We stayed there a couple hours, wifi was good, and got some work done.  Polk street has been really updated with better bike accessibility and good for walking and this is one spot you should check out!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great place for coffee. The coffee shop itself is beautifully—bright and minimal. It’s also remote worker friendly with plenty of seating. I can get busy but all in all a great neighborhood coffee shop.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The coffee was amazing! The vibe was good and place is nice. The barista looked really sad though, hopefully just having a rough-ish day!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Loved the single origin coffee flight, for $11 it's a great caffeine to $ ratio 😅  Cold brew wasn't As good"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Coffee is coffee is coffee.  It’s good and it’s a good place to come to for good drip, pour-over and espresso based drinks.  The pour-over we tried (shown in pictures) is a bit on the weak side but to each their own tastes.  The best thing is that this space is gorgeous. There’s a few skylights that brightens up the space.  There is a single washroom at the back room.  The pour-over is made by a machine."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Outstanding excellent coffee but you will pay for it. $7+ for a cup of coffee is very pricey. Other than that, 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"2 stars for great coffee, -3 for poor service.  I can't emphasize enough how disappointing it is to return to a place where you've previously had excellent experiences — a place where you believe in the quality and mission of the coffee and business — and watch guests be manhandled and treated unprofessionally. It was clear today that the first point of contact at the espresso machine was taking out her bad day on the guests, eyerolls included.  I don't think any cafe would want to set the tone as unwelcoming from the start, especially Saint Frank. I'm crossing my fingers that this was just an off day, but that type of behavior — consistent or not — is honestly what gives places a bad reputation. The unpleasant vibes at the front need to be addressed for the cafe to retain that relaxed, community-driven atmosphere that it's known for.  The barista who made the pourover at the back also made the experience bearable, both in technique (did I say great coffee already?) and personality. Big props to her for carrying the team today."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"More of a to go place then a place to sit down and enjoy your coffee or work on your laptop. Sitting area is far from comfortable and there are very few power outlets. Coffee was ok but the croissant was not warmed up. The only non dairy milk they have was macadamia milk. Oh, and no wifi and Sundays."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Amazing coffee! Worth the wait and the cost. The muffins are fantastic
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The coffee is very creamy and sweet comparing to other brand in the city. I personally love it. They use Craftman&Wolves pastries which are simply some of the best you can find across the globe 🌎 …
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Pretty nice coffee shop. Cappuccino was really well made. Cashier was super nice. Bathroom was clean.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,🥲 it’s heaven here. Try the pastries they are exceptional and the baristas are super friendly. …
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Delicious coffee and 10/10 food options: The Rebel Within egg muffin has a soft-boiled egg inside!!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Absolutely excellent coffee. Their house almond macadamia milk is really good. Coffee quality is also nice and the baristas are very good. Highly recommend.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Saint Frank is so good. Please do yourself a favor and don’t go to Starbucks or Philz. The quality of the beans here are superior to anything in a 100 mile radius. I would compare Saint Franks to be on par with the local coffee shops in Portland, OR and Seattle, WA. The almond milk is made in house and so the lattes taste immaculate. It gets very busy on Saturday and Sunday but it’s so worth the wait. They also sell curated batch made beans if you want Saint Frank’s at home. 10/10 would 100% recommend frequenting this coffee establishment."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Easily one of the best coffees in the bay area. Little brother espresso beans are a must buy for at-home espresso makers.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Contemporary setting, limited outside seating with the sun beating on your face is a+ Proper coffee (my favorite - cortado) done by baristas, a treat indeed!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Nice space, but inattentive baristas make for bad coffee. If you aren paying attention, how will you know the coffee isn't over or under extracted before giving someone mediocre coffee for $5? Perhaps just a bad shift this time around."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The coffee beans seemed good but the coffee makers weren't careful with the beans and the coffee was mediocre. The shop is adorable. There isn't much happening on that street so this is a good place to stop anyway.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"A great example of what a cafe can be: clean and beautiful design (and branding). Light-filled space with lots of seating. And most importantly, great coffee and knowledgeable baristas. Bonus points: you get a free cup of coffee when you buy a bag of beans :)"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Pleasant atmosphere. Reasonably priced for San Francisco. Ordered the latte - enjoyed drinking it and looking at it. Will come again.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice specialty coffee place. Highly recommend getting a pour over for presentation and quality
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Coffee is smooth, milk and coffee ratio is good, not too bitter even when it’s dark roast"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Highly recommended. This is my favorite coffee shop in SF. They do a great job on the roasting and the space is really nice. We liked the cappuccino better than the cortado.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The coffee here was delicious! They have a full single origin coffee pour over menu to choose from. The presentation of the pour over was very well done and the environment of the coffee shop was welcoming. I'll definitely be buying some beans next time I make it back here.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Went in close to 530pm. Definitely loved the cafe shop feel. A bit confused on where to order. The server was super nice. I vent remember their specialty latte I order but it was delicious! It was a quick caffeine pick me up. Great location!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Best cafeteria we found in our last trip to SF (Abd when visit plenty). The baristas are very talented and kind, the place itself has a modern and cozy environment, the croissants and banana cake was absolutely delicious and the cappuccino was amazing. Can't wait to travel to SF again and visit Saint Frank!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Coffee experience was great , staff could have been more friendly I guess."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"My father has been coming here for multiple years now, and he loves it! I personally hate coffee and the flavor of it so I couldn’t tell you how good the coffee is. My father on the other hand, loves coffee and says that the coffee here is absolutely immaculate. The ice tea, pastries, cookies, and croissants are all incredible as well. The service here is always great since the employees are friendly and caring every time I walk through the doors. I would highly recommend this coffee shop if you are looking for a great place to enjoy breakfast or brunch in the city. 10 out of 10!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Delicious options (coffee, non-coffee, plus desserts); friendly staff, interior seating in a hip atmosphere."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Lovely chilled and clean coffee bar. Staff are knowledgeable and make a great latte. As ever in SF, lots of people hogging space with their laptops so you may struggle to get a table."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Awesome clean space with lots of natural light. Baristas we're very friendly and helpful in recommending what coffee to try
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great, fun specialty coffee with a friendly staff. An enjoyably clean, light atmosphere. Great cafe in a great coffee city. Worth seeking out, perhaps especially for the espresso."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I ordered Kaffe Tonic, it was good. Better than expectation."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Unfortunately no cold brew but the barista suggested their iced coffee instead. It’s very nice. Rich and complex flavor. Very satisfying. Coffee was $4.00 which I felt was very reasonable.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Ask them to put a little bit of chocolate in the drip coffee. But they would not do that. Not sure why not. Instead, one of the baristas recommended I get a mocha. It tasted horrible. My brother's coffee was horribly acidic. Not sure if that was the intended flavor. Lot of people patronizing this place. Not sure why. Probably the worst coffee I've had in San Francisco. I would avoid this one."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Cute spot, top notch coffee and amazing baristas... Awful wifi. AWFUL WIFI. Really important you know that before considering spending a day working online there."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"St Frank coffee hits strong on all the important points:  Taste, creativity, attention to detail, design, friendly service, and perhaps most important, I learned that they work to build strong personal relationships with their small local coffee producers around the world. While recently visiting both their Polk shop and the new Juniper/St. Frank bakery location, I felt like they wanted to provide a 1st class coffee experience, not just take my money and push me back outside."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Friendly baristas, nice ambience, very clean. I loved their orange latte!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The most friendly place on Earth! Everyone here—staff and patrons—are super friendly. On top of that, the coffee is excellent."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Cozy but open shop with minimalist design, and excellent single origin coffees. Colombian light roast pour over was a 10/10."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great for coffee. Quick, friendly service, spacious venue. I couldn't get the wifi to work, it was way too slow, so that's a potential minus."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great quality coffee. Want whole beans? A pour-over? A barista that you can assume is qualified based solely on their accent? Go to Saint Frank Coffee!  You’ll spend almost $20 on a coffee, a pastry and the tip, but HEY! you’re on Polk. What’d you expect?  You can expect a line outside most times, unique pastries and high quality coffee. The interior is minimalist with lots of white, plants and light color wood. Great for that aesthetic study space. There’s also plenty to do, eat and drink in the surrounding area.  Exception: I got a cappuccino with macadamia milk here one time (which is already an novelty), and I won’t go for the alternative milk option here again. They just didn’t do it well. Came out so sour!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Custom made espresso machine.  Pretty unique.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Awesome friendly staff, delicious coffees, teas and their pastry items are chefs kiss. I suggest the oat pistachio cookie and the almond croissant, but you cannot go wrong here. Chai tea is awesome as well."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice environment and good coffee. Met a cool guy here
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"2340 Polk San Francisco No Wi-Fi No power outlets Great coffee various styles, try the flight! Only few mediocre snacks, but still a go to for coffee lovers!  Also a good place to have a chat about the art of coffee farming and brewing.  Would recommend and look forward to my next visit"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Used to be a big fan but ‘frankly’ the espresso quality is quite low now.  Also bought $20 worth of espresso and asked for a credit towards an espresso (since I do not enjoy drip coffee). I was denied straight away.  Avoid this place now.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Tried the Matcha Latte and cappuccino. Cappuccino was great.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great ambience, good coffee, good pastries, reasonable prices. Definitely coming back. Pictured is the Almond Macadamia Latte"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Cute place! Good coffee and pastries. Unfortunately the staff forgot to smile … and there is no plug available for customers.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Ok, this Coffee is AMAZING! We woke up needing coffee to start our busy day of sight seeing and saw great reviews for this shop. There was a bit of a line when we got there, but it didn't take too long. I got an iced espresso with oatmilk and salted simple syrup. Holy heck it was good! It was also strong, I didn't need a coffee the entire rest of my day. My friend got and iced coffee and loved it also, he also didn't need another coffee for the rest of the day. I wish I would have taken a pic, but I was too busy enjoying it. My espresso was around $5 not too bad."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,A cosy café with a friendly team of baristas. A variety of beans for pour over and espresso are on offer. The café does get crowded and a bit loud at times.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,My favourite local coffee spot to go with a book and escape for a few hours. The unmatched choice selection of coffee and the minimalist design will make you feel both zinging and zen when you leave.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Quite literally one of the best local coffee shops.  I was extremely disappointed at Equator, my go-to for years so I remembered St. Frank’s sitting pretty just a few blocks from me. And thus, I’m a dedicated customer now.  Within minutes, you’ll arrive, order, enjoy the friendliest of exchanges, and depart with a great coffee in hand. You’re not going to order and linger around - their making your coffee for all to see right on the counter in front of you as you are still telling them the particulars. The psychology behind this is just truly amazing.  I also love the name. Guessing it’s based off San Francisco - St. Francis and I just love that."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Incredible coffee, lovely hipster atmosphere and the staff are always friendly and personable. There’s no Wifi on the weekends and it can sometimes be slow if you sit near the back area. Always enjoy visiting, it’s what every coffee shop should be like."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Best shop in SF- friendly and knowledgeable in a way that’s become very rare, unfortunately. Perfect cortado temperatures! Excellent experience."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Wonderful coffee and pastries, friendly staff, and dog friendly!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Classy coffee, the baristas have lots of awards. A coffee shop that really knows espresso"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Friendly service  from all baristas ( such as Josh and Jason) who take their jobs seriously and do it well; They have a great new parklet and serve one of the best cappuccinos in San Fran;  But the cafe is a tad precious about their coffee in making you feel they fly in the fresh beans  as soon as you order the coffee ; they even milk cows in the store as you wait for coffee ;  they even hand you an essay on their beans.  Colorless interior design has the lifeless austerity of a monastery where young monks stare into their computers. Soundtrack is non-existent. Outdoors,  people march their dogs on public adulation tours; this results in dull conversations about canines. But I rather be a pet I think.  Overall a good neighborhood cafe!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Chill vibe, brilliant coffee. Met me now girlfriend there. Highly recommend the place :)"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Excellent coffee, clean, light, busy spot. Maple pine latte- aromatic not too sweet- yum!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Awesome coffee for lovers of espresso and Almond, Macadamia milk cappachino is an interesting mix."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Throughout the past year I’ve gotten into making my coffee at home. With that, I’ve gotten more particular about coffee I buy from a shop. This is one of the first places I’ve had in a while I’ve been impressed by. Knowledgeable staff, great coffee in an array of roasts. Also really nice that if you buy beans by the bag you get a complimentary filter coffee cup.  Also on their website they include brewing recipes for the V60 which is very nice."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Excellent coffee, polite and efficient staff, and a nice vibe. The seating is a little hard to come by but I love doing work here! The bathroom is clean, as well as the entire establishment as a whole. I always get an iced latte with their homemade macadamia nut milk."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Can’t tell which one I like more, their Cappuccino or Kouign-amann."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Just so good. They love coffee
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Love stopping here while in San Francisco. The coffee is excellent and made right in front of you while you wait. Lots of seating options inside and out.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great spot!  Friendly staff - excellent design of barista to customer interaction.   Clean look.  Loved the vibe!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Their coffee beans were way different from any other coffee shop in the city. I love the ambiance of the place. It was very airy and tidy. They also serve pastries and cookies, and they were the best! I am so happy they were located near my workplace, so before heading to work, I will drop by and buy my coffee."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Excellent coffee. What a true speciality coffee should taste like
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"My fav coffee shop in Russian Hill. Hands down. Clean, good vibes, amazing coffee. Hot or cold, the attention to the coffee goes a long way to bring out robust flavors. The staff is friendly and the rotating pastries are worth trying.  The coffee is so good, I have a subscription for the days where I don’t walk to the cafe. St. Frank does it right."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"We liked how they prepared coffee for customers. We could say that they have expertise in combining the flavors for the taste is great. Just like what we had last Saturday. We ordered our favorite coffee and desserts. The taste was amazing for it was the desired taste we wanted to. Thus, we would like to thank all of you! We will recommend this place as well!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Staff was great and we really enjoyed the concept of a flight if coffee
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Very good mocha and extremely friendly staff! I love that they don't put cup lids on so avoiding unnecessary waste.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"A very nice selection of coffee and some serious grinders show how serious the owners take high end coffee. However, the brewing itself is very important, and both the pour over and the ice coffee tasted like that was botched. This was our first time here so maybe it was bad luck, so I'll keep it at 4 stars. Two iDevice minimum."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"One of my favorite cafe, coffee is constantly great, people are friendly and helpful. They also have some selection of sweet or savory pastries. The vibe is energetic here, sometimes there is a queue but it goes fast and it is worth the time."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The barista was very knowledgeable about the coffee, he explained every detail. He even helped out when I bought packs of coffee to bring home. The staff members were all friendly and accommodating. I was more than satisfied with the coffee. It was worth savoring. We'll be coming back here again soon!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Good coffee and nice staff! I would like there to be added non-sweet food, or something sugar-free!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I love visiting Saint Frank to enjoy their pour-overs and espresso drinks. The Russian Hill location has a cozy atmosphere with local art on display, while the SoMA roastery (1081 Mission) is open for tasting flights of both coffee beans from independent producers as well latte servings made by expert baristas who know how make each drink just right!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The coffee is great, it’s close to the bluebottle coffee, bright and medium toasted. The staff are friendly, the seating area is pretty good, it has in door and outdoor seatings. The pastry collection is alright, not super fresh, it’s just okay. But they know what they are doing comes to a good cup of coffee."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"So many stars for the orange cream latte and vegan raspberry chocolate bar.  Sprinkle more stars for excellent customer service and open spaces for reading, laptop-ing, and cellphone-ing!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The decor and space is amazing, and I liked seeing my drink being prepared in front of me.  But ironically, the attention to the coffee just wasn't there for me.  I drink cappuccinos (or cortados if the cappuccino cup isn't the proper size).  Found the espresso just okay, and the milk wasn't steamed long enough to be more than lukewarm.  Presentation was nice as was the service.  But the cappuccino was a disappointment.  Maybe I'll give them one more try!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great coffee shop! It was exactly what I needed before dinner. Their holiday spiced latte was delicious. My daughter got the hot chocolate and said it was delicious too! Knowledgeable and friendly barista who explained all of the ingredients as well. I do love a good coffee shop!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Definitely a hip place. Nice building and vibe. Efficient service. Downside is that the coffee isn't quite of the standard you'd expect in a place like this. My cappuccino was a weird mix of viscous froth and milk to coffee ratio wrong. Not awful - but for price would expect a better barrista.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,This place has been recommended by a friend telling me they serve the best coffee in the area. I have to admit it tastes amazing. They have some creative latte options which I loved. You may have to wait in line for a while though.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,All I can say is yum! There's plenty of seating to accommodate small groups as well as solo coffee lovers and they handle long lines like it's nobody's business. The draft latte is delicious! Why go to Starbucks when you can get a better cup of coffee at a place like this!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The atmosphere was beautiful and the presentation was great. But the espresso tasted pretty burnt in our cappuccinos, and the service was decent. Not a great first experience, but definitely willing to give it another shot as this place comes with high praise."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"There was delicious and reasonably priced coffee and food. It's a lovely spot with a lively, welcoming vibe. The team has been extremely helpful and has met all of my expectations. The Wi-Fi connections are also really strong. It comes with a strong recommendation!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Spent 7 days in San Fran and this was our go to place. Quick drive from where we were staying and our first stop in the mornings before heading out for fun. We tried others that week but always lackluster.  Keep up the great lattes!  We'll be back.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Delicious cappuccino, and wonderful pastries. Hot chocolate exquisitely dark."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Service was a little unhelpful, coffee tasted good but we found better and cheaper alternatives down the street. If you want specialty coffee this is your place, but it's overpriced, small serving size and vibes are a little cold. Hate to write a lukewarm review but that's just what you'll experience here."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The quality of the coffee here is some of the best in the city. Classic 3rd wave shop with a delightful open space. Barista's are amazing and skilled. Pastries are adequate.  However, Saint Franks is always super busy. There may be a line and little room to sit. Keep that in mind."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"My favorite go to Cafe for a good comforting cup of cappuccino. I love the vibe of this place and the baristas are super friendly. If you are into tea, do try their Oolong tea. A great place to get some work done (but they don't have a power outlet 😬) post lunch it tends to get pretty busy. …"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I’m the type who follows Coffee Review and orders from coffee roasters across the US. Saint Frank’s stacks up well against any coffees from CR’s top-30 list. I recently learned Saint Frank’s actually send some of the staff on sourcing trips, versus using brokers which I believe is more common. The staff really know their coffee — ask Josh or anyone there about roasting or brew methods. I usually pick up a bag or two of their whole beans, with a rotating selection keeping things interesting. The beans are large and consistent, and there is never a stale bag on the shelves; this indicates to me that these folks take quality very seriously."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Best speciality coffee in SF. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who appreciate top espresso.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great coffee. Unfortunately, no wi-fi. This is something San Francisco is famous for. Luring people to get coffee and spend time with laptop, but without providing them internet. Even knowing that 4G-5G network suck at the city. Solid 2 for not knowing/recognizing people needs."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Fantastic coffee. Friendly staff. The perfect neighborhood spot!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"GREAT coffee! Small but fabulous is what I think. The Batista's actually know how to make espresso drinks. My go to, cappuccino is always spot on. Some places make you sometime closers to a latte instead. Super friendly staff. 5 stars all the way."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Ordering a shot of espresso gives a barista the chance to show me what they got. I love getting a great shot to remind me of how good a well prepared quality coffee can taste. I didn’t get a quality shot here. The underlying coffee was good but I don’t think the barista was paying attention leading to a weak, sour shot. Maybe just an off day?"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"We sat outside and got caught up with our good friend Tom, who lives around the block from this place. We got lattes and a couple of pastries/baked goods. While nothing stood out as particularly amazing, it was a perfectly adequate place to get a cup of coffee. Prices were what you would expect. I would certainly go back if we were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't, say, drive across town specifically to go here. It's nice to see a non-chain do well."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"AMAZING is all I can say about this place.  It is on the extremely pricey side of artisan coffee goes, but it is definitely a treat.  They take time to really make and care for the coffee process and is just perfect.  Take a stroll down Polk street on a weekend and grab a cup of coffee from here, you won't regret it!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice cafe to do some work or hang out with friends. Good coffee and great ambience!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great service. Love the affagato and mocha.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Located near a bunch of places on Polk. Love the all-white look for the cafe. $5+ for a pourover is pretty steep, if you ask me. That being said, if you're a coffee lover, you can taste the quality for sure. I haven't had any of the pastries, but there are options."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Hands-down my favorite coffee shop in SF. The space is beautiful and bright. Coffee is relationally-sourced and the drinks are always well-executed. If you're feeling adventurous or in the mood to try something new, give the Kaffe Tonic a whirl! It's a shot of espresso served over tonic water. Very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The owner or manager not sure who was the person making coffee but was very rude and uptight. Not sure if it does have a dress code but a coffee shop should be a place to relax and not be all poshed up. Never going back. The coffee is not outstanding but very average.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Saint Frank Coffee has a hipster large swanky feel to it. With light wooden flooring and white walls and a high ceilings it surely feels very inviting. I've been to Saint Frank twice. The first time I tried the drop coffee which was good but not great, I've tried better ones. The second time I had the cappuccino. It was a lot stronger than the caps from a blue bottle or a ritual. Its a good option for Russian hill but certainly not my favorite in San Francisco."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great coffee place. I had a mocha that was good. The service was great too. You can hang out there to catch up with friends or work for a little as well.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"This is my go to spot on Polk St for a place to get out of my apartment and work. Friendly service, good atmosphere, there isn't always a spot to sit bit if there is you're in luck. Free wifi (weekdays only). On the menu my favorites include their winter spice hot chocolate with house made nut milk, yogurt and granola, chocolate chip cookie, and they no longer serve it but I used to really enjoy the holy basil tea. Now they have some sort of herbal marshmallow tea that's pretty good too."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Pricey but absolutely exquisite !!! The pastries were delightful and the coffee was certainly some of the best I’ve ever tried. Perfect stop for a rainy, windy day in SF."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Solid coffee...I had their Cappucino with almond macadamia milk, didn't have to add sugar to it...perfect as is.  Chill (but not too too quiet) vibe with a clean, high-ceiling industrial design.  Great for doing some work, reading, or meeting up with a friend.  And on Polk St, so plenty of eats/shops to explore after you get your caffeine fix!  Single table and bar table seating downstairs, small loft up top.  Potentially crowded during busy hours if you're looking to sit down, but I think generally it's a great spot."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The space at this coffee shop is beautiful. The regular coffee is good, but DO NOT get their house made macadamia nut milk as an alternative (they have no soy or almond milk). It tasted sour and rancid. I've been here twice and I thought I would give it a chance the second time but I was wrong. I'm not sure why it tastes sour but it does not make for a good coffee."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Super efficient and friendly service, and delicious coffee! I was so impressed by how short the wait was even with a long line."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"What a find. This coffee shop is a lovely two story joint with an affogato bar located upstairs. This roastery has a rustic feel to it that only boosts the positive vibes. I love this coffee shop because of the communal design of the upstairs; large group tables bring people together, making this place a wonderful spot to discuss ideas and work. Highly recommend you check this gem out."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Very beautiful cafe, light-flooded and neatly decorated with a nice view on the street! Coffee is awesome and some nice pastries to snack! Big recommendation for people that need to work during the week (wifi is not for working on weekends, what I personally don't like as I often work on weekends but the idea behind it is cute and during the week the wifi is strong!!)"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"A favorite Russian Hill coffee spot.  Locally owned, and they source their own beans, which are roasted by Ritual. Sleek, bright, and clean interior, pleasant place to work, read, meet friends, or have a meeting.  Gets direct sun in the afternoons.  A few outside tables.  Food is good as well, but selection is limited and tends towards pastries.  Can get crowded."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Pretty coffee and tasty espresso. Staff are self indulged, but it IS San Francisco so I can't hold them to a higher standard.  This is a popular little cafe so it's hard to find a spot and a window seat seems highly coveted."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"No cash payments. Great coffee, pastries and service. Good observation of health procedures. Seating available in spaced tables on sidewalk. Designated waiting line outside to enter. Coffee beans available from this high end coffee house."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Pros: nice ambiance (minimalist white walls and wood table vibe); great coffee  Cons: NO WIFI ON WEEKENDS; Expensive $$$  Came here a few years ago and had a nice experience. Never coming back now 💔
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice little lovely coffee joint. Taste good.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Excellent shop - little too ""upscale"" for a guy used to the usual hipster shops and the crew of beanie capped plad-clad people that inhabit them, but a delicious, vibrant floral-noted Kenyan roast makes the trip more than worth the atmosphere."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"A well-refined, clean and intense espresso, with an excellent chocolate to infuse for the mocha.  There are multiple methods available to create your coffee, and when we visited, a great single-source Guatemala bean - unique for our experience in SF so far.  The decore is open, and there is a lot of room, but well situated to allow great individual space if you need it."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,One of the best coffee shops in the city! Good coffee and good environment!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Its a very clean, simple, minimalist coffee shop. No outlets are available besides the upstairs loft. They brew Ritual Coffee which I don't find too special but great atmosphere and the nicest baristas. Good place to read a book and relax without worrying about noise."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"My favorite neighborhood coffee in this area. Top quality coffee in a city full of amazing coffee roasting coffee shops. Always full of people, so expect to wait for a seat. Also has a unique and beautiful interior design."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,We just came here on Sunday last minute as they were closing up. The guys were super friendly and nice to let us order and hang out as they were shutting the store for the day.  We shared couple coffees and the amazing Kouign Amann pastry - basically the next level of croissant! I want to come back to try more coffee and more baked goodies :)  Loved the location on Polk street. Such a beautiful neighbourhood to walk by and get gorgeous views of the ocean as you walk more up on Russian Hill.  I can feel my cravings screaming!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Expensive, but still I'm drawn to these types of cafes that serves the hipster crowd in a modern minimalist atmosphere. Lots of space for seating, but come on an overcast or rainy day, you'll find this place rather dark and gloomy and less welcoming than what the photos show. They rely on natural lighting here, so when I came on an overcast day, I didn't feel very inclined to stay long. Their cappuccino is solid; would like to try their flight next time.  A little bit of co-worker drama, though, when one of the baristas took my order. He fulfilled the order without a fuss, but didn't make the drink and told the other guy to do it, who in turn, gave him a noticeable eye roll. LOL! What's going on here. Let's talk this out guys, talk this out!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Coffee flight and service were both great.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Good coffee place with an interesting flight of coffees. The flight could be a little more adventurous as they served the same beans just prepared in a few fashions (ice coffee, espresso, late, ect). I think this could be a really cool way to give people the chance to try different beans side by side if that was an option."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I like this store bc it has some nice spaces and good coffee. When the sun comes out, this place will light up and it just brightens up this place. Franks has this coffee flight that i would definitely like to try. Only bad part is that wifi is only free on the weekdays and there are no plugs for your computers. The upstairs has a big group table and overlooks the downstairs seating area. Overall nice place place! Would come back here if i am around the area and need to kill some time!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"This modern, stylish, beautifully crafted coffee shop was designed with purpose. It feels like you're walking into an art gallery, curated with coffee-inspired objects. Upon entering, the music instantly creates a feeling of relaxation. The coffee is exceptionally good. Enjoy."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Wow delicious espresso. Kind and professional staff
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Cool place to study and drink coffee! The coffee is really good and the people are friendly! So great. Unbeatable prices,  great staff, warm, spacious, and a great place to work. All you can ask for."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great service, great coffee, great pastries."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Sleek, cool place on upper Polk St. Not only top quality single origin beans,  but great personalized service. Experienced baristas are friendly and very knowledgeable. Tables outside are popular on sunny days."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,So I like non dairy lattes. They didn't have soy or just plain almond milk. They had a macadamia nut milk that I thought was really sour. The coffee place has a cool ambience with nice baristas but I prefer CAW.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Real coffee! One of the best what I have in US. People who wants real espresso should stop there.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Solid coffee shop, very cute location, and great honey lavender latte. Has no electrical plugs, which is a good thing to note."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,I had the Almond Macadamia Latte and it was amazing. I'm from Texas so I needed something to warm me up. The inside is laid back and the service is great. I'm really big on customer service and I wasn't let down here.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Friendly staff. Quality espresso. Bright, space."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Coffee is so smooth and delicious here. Baristas are impeccably dressed and really professional. You can tell they really care about what they do. They even taste-test batches of coffee.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Just walked all the way over here from across town specifically for the coffee... only to find a note at the door saying they're closing early (2pm vs the listed 6pm) both on the 30th and 31st. No mention of this on their Instagram or here on Google. Disappointing is an understatement. Certainly won't be trying to go back.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Hip coffee joint, modern and minimal.  Delicious pour overs and espresso.  Tasty treats.  Good lookin' peeps and friendly staff.  Not a ton of table room, but decent for a solo reader or worker."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Out of the 3 times I joined the line out the door, I only stayed in line 1 time to see what the hype was all about. The 2 times I left, I had to head somewhere else for something that would actually sustain me for breakfast. (Only pastries, bread, and granola available which just counteracts the alertness from the coffee + there are not non-dairy options for yogurt unfortunately).  The dirty chai wasnt the best for the price, but maybe I'll try adding honey or getting a cappuccino next time. The drink menu is VERY limited. ++ No cold brew - just coffee poured over ice........  The place seems promising, with a line constantly out the door. I'll probably return for an afternoon pick me up instead of a breakfast run."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Finally, a hipster coffee shop in Russian Hill!  Great coffee (drip, pour over, lattes, etc.), friendly baristas, gorgeous minimalist space.  My only issue is that most of the time every single seat is taken up by a person with a laptop, and thus, I often get my coffee to go."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I don't care how good the coffee or drinks are, if you're going to offer Wi-Fi, it better be at a reasonable speed. Also how do you not offer plugs for customers to use if they're going to work there? If I'm going to read, why would I go to a coffee shop where it's noisy and people who are looking for plugs will bother me?"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I had a bit more expectations on this place having been reccomended by some people. Coffee was ok más staff nice. I really thought it would be a specialty coffee but we arrived in such a rush hour baristas had to hit so many coffees and attention to detail was not permisible. Even though, they were servicing real fast and pulling good shots."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"This coffee shop earned ""best coffee"" on my friend's US road trip. They do amazing things with their espresso and alternative milks. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it's so dang expensive!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great new place to grab a coffee and snack.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great Polk St coffee shop. Minimalist decor does not reflect in their well presented coffees. Their ham and cheese croissant is one of my favorites in town.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Had the almond macadamia nut latte and it is so faboo it needs no sugar or honey. I highly recommend to my vegan friends. And nice sunny (today) chill atmosphere with downtempo tunes playing.  Update. Again faboo and perfect though crowded with people at computers....I hope they tip well...
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,This is the best coffee in San Francisco! The espresso-based drinks are consistently pulled superbly. The staff here is passionate and exacting in their craft.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Love Saint Frank Coffee!  My fav: - Almond & Macadamia Milk Cappuccino - Honey Lavender Latte
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Using organic Clover milk and not overly roasted espresso (Starbucks), plus a touch of simple syrup makes for a beautiful latte. Good service and a gorgeously minimalist interior."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Coffee is OK but WiFi doesn't work on the weekends - not handy if you are a foreign traveller without data and need to get online!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"It's not your average mod bar, as a matter of fact it's not a mod bar at all. This brown town extracting, sweet milk steaming, coffee brewing chrome clad machine is sure to please. (The staff is knowledgeable as well)"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice cafe with delicious baked goods.  Coffees were a little sour (under extracted?) on the 2nd visit but were fine on the first.  Ample seating and street parking.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Good coffee drinks, friendly staff, efficient service and nice indoor+outdoor tables. I ordered an orange creme latte that was delicious."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"This is high quality third wave coffee but I wasn't impressed with their pour over brewing method. They use a marco automatic pour over MACHINE. I don't pay the extra money for a machine to make my coffee. I totally understand that a machine is more consistent and has the perfect water temperature but thats not what Im interested in. I like the human element, I enjoy a human pouring their energy and intention into my cup of coffee, even if it isn't exactly the same every time. They also don't pre-warm your mug. I know that sounds might pretentious but to me it is the norm for third wave coffeeshops. They were busy, maybe that is what happened, but overall the place felt as sterile as their machine pour overs."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I love their machiatto. I dislike the usual crowd. Lots of laptops, and an awkward space between ordering your drink and waiting for it. But for the coffee/espresso alone, it's a must!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Amazing coffee, and nicest people you could ever meet. So much cheerier than some of the grumps running nearby coffee shops. Always a pleasure to visit. Outstanding coffee, outstanding peeps."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Carefully put together space, with a coffee lovers ascetic aesthetic. Bow down before your friendly coffee Gods, give your offerings and pray you can find a space not taken by a brostartuper or a yupmom. Fortunately, as a coffee aesthete, I enjoyed it immensely."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Always come here for the coffee and teas and their breakfast burritos and short rib and potato hash is awesome. Great service as well.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"The design of the venue is great, the only thing I didn't like was actually the coffee. If you're a coffee lover who likes balck and espressos you'll find the coffee is sour and to acid."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Great coffee with balanced flavor. Nice clean modern decor. Efficient staff. House-made almond milk. Better than sight glass.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great coffee, nice pastries, dropped a star bc no power outlets so you better go with a fully charged battery if you plan to work"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Incredibly delicious and aesthetically-pleasing pour over!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Excellent Coffee! I've been coming here from near when they opened and I'm glad to see that they have stuck around for so long! Must be doing something right.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Elegant inside, very solid third wave coffee and nice breakfast pastries. Dope designs on their carrying bags!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Friendly staff and great coffee (that's not Ritual as someone said, they roast there though as I understand it). Make sure to try the cafe tonic that's simply divine a hot day. One of my absolute favorites in the city."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Cool vibe and design. Ordered a pourover which I think is something that shouldn't be automated. Huge lack of attention to this process that left my cup sitting with filter over it for probably 2min longer than it should resulting in an overdeveloped cup which was kind of a let down because I believe their roasting would be pretty good.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"A clean, contemporary cafe that treats cappuccino like a precious work of art. They'll weigh the freshly-ground beans for each espresso pull and fiddle with the milk until they're completely satisfied."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Staff were unfriendly and rude, snooty and not at all welcoming. Told me they would bring the coffee out to me then after 10 min i went to find it and it had been sitting on the bench and the barista was on his phone. Coffee was good which was the only saving grace but way overpriced. Not worth the hype. Wont be coming back."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Cool spot with cute coffee and wifi but no electric plug. It's almost as though they purposely do not want people to work here. I unfortunately made the mistake of buying coffee before I sat down only to realize my computer was uncharged. Charge at home!!!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Clean modern looking coffee bar with well prepared coffee.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Friendly staff, great atmosphere and decor. Capuchino is strong."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Good service and I tried the Cortado which is an equal mix of warm milk and expresso.  They didn't have the spicy apple caramel flavor but at least I saved some calories!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Good pastries and coffee but they don’t have WiFi on the weekends and they don’t advertise this fact. Don’t get baited like us :(
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Supper cute spot!! Great food. Only reason why I didn't give them 4 stars is because it took way too long for the food to come out. And that's not good when you have hungry kids.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Everyone who works here is so nice, all the time. I’m starting to think it’s a front for a money laundering scheme, or an invasion of the bodysnatchers situation"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Staff is very friendly. Very expensive compared to other nearby coffee shops. I have found their espresso drinks to be inconsistent.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Fantastic selection of beans. Their mocha is the best in the city. The homemade almond macadamia milk is great.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Good spot for coffee or snacks. Right in the thick of the upper Polk neightborhood - Polk Gulch. I stop in about once a week.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Love their coffee  but also the interior design is nice!
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Really good coffee and chocolate croissant. Totally worth the $10 :) the staff is very nice too. It’s a little small and there’s a line, but again,totally worth it."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Super long line in the middle of the day on a Saturday. The interior is cute but their iced black coffee is sour and diluted.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Possibly the best ordering/barista experience I've ever had on a morning coffee run. Don't skip the baked goods either.

Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Had the Kaffe Tonic: Espresso over Fever Tree Tonic in Ice. Delicious and naturally sweetened.  A great dog-spotting aight with lots of interesting people.  Worth stopping in.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Espresso does not meet Italian standards and was too sour/ under-extracted. They should be able to do better than that.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Consistently good espresso shots pulled.  They also develop relationships with their coffee farmers and continue to use the same ones year after year for their single origin coffees.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great coffee, even better was the service :)"

Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"I walked in not looking my best (bed-head, boozer breathe, the smell of cigarettes, a wrist covered with stamps from the night before), but the baristas were able to put that all aside and be the most professional and friendly baristas ever. The place looks like something out of Kinfolk magazine. It is so bright (to my hung over eyes) and well-lit. You'll probably run into people with film cameras with hoodies that like bespoke from American Giant and hall that gear with Langley bags. You'll also run into young women descended from Yankee traders that settled here in the 1860s. They're probably wearing a yellow Sunday brunch dress when most women used to or were required to wear such things. The cappucino here is excellent and made to perfection. The barista made what seemed like something ready to drink, but he through it out, and said he had to make my drink a again. This dedication to craft is beyond rare, and why I will be going to this place the next time I need to nurse a hangover in Russian Hill. Heck, the ladies in Sunday brunch dresses is enough to bring me back."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,I’m always annoyed when the only non-dairy option is almond milk - but especially so when it splits the coffee and makes it un-drinkable. The team working were also quite rude. Wouldn’t return.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Another staple every time I visit the city. Very simple and clean, which is what I appreciate about it. They also used to serve a dreamsicle latte that was incredible, I'm hoping for its return soon."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Great coffee, great vibes"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Most Australian coffee place I have found so far. Most the places around here miss the mark. These guys have got it down pat. Only thing maybe the baristas should crack a bit more of a smile and have a bit of a laugh with customers

Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Had a delicious single origin espresso from Honduras. Perfecto.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Fancy expensive coffee. Great location. Excellent beans. The cookies are also great. They usually provide a free drip coffee with purchase of a bag of beans
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Hands down for the Best Chai tea in town. If you like Osha tea house, or masala chai in general its almost the same."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,A coffee shop with outdoor seating as well as communal tables that are a little awkward due to setup.  Coffee was good and strong and overall the place had a nice vibe and friendly staff.

Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"This is a fantastic coffee shop! Their espresso is mild, and their extractions are dialed in! Ditch the Starbucks, and treat yourself to Saint Frank."
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The coffee is very creamy and sweet comparing to other brand in the city. I personally love it.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,These guys actually know what's important: coffee. They roast all their stuff light so the coffee actually tastes like it's supposed to! Nice decor and friendly people too.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"Their caffe mocha and iced mocha use a really good bitter sweet chocolate, probably my favorite in the area. If they served affogato I would never go anywhere else."

Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,"It's ok, I guess. Nothing special. I'm newer to the city, but I'm well-traveled. It's the most pretentious coffee shop that I've ever been to.  If drinking a $5 cup of coffee inside what feels like an Apple Store is your thing, Saint Frank Coffee is your place!"
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Nice place with good light and good food
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Just another example of a coffee shop not caring about its patrons. Stay open past 7pm and I promise you you'll get business! Laziness or profit + happier customers. Thanks.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,The worst tasting coffee I have ever tasted. Kaffe cola tastes like authentic Indian curry and iced filter coffee is too sour.
Saint Frank Coffee,2340 Polk St,Amazing quality espresso. Anywhere that weighs the coffee dose and the extracted weight is a winner to me. Really impressed.
