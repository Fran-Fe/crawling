Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Walked by this place, and their amazing coffee smelled pulled me over to order a Chai Latte substitute with soymilk (my favorite drink above coffee)  It was AMAZING, I’m writing this review while sipping it. Their foam was so rich, thick and creamy. I haven’t tried other drink in Henry’s but the Chai Latte here is way far better than Starbuck.  Then I decided to get a Croissant eat along. Definitely recommend to everyone I know."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Cold brew was triple decent. Drip coffee was 3/5 according to my source across from me drinking it. Breakfast bagels were good!
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,I purchased Armenian coffee. I was very excited to try something new. First of all package was not seal it was open. Second it doesn’t taste anything like Armenian/ Turkish coffee. I could just purchase black coffee and grind it with Turkish size grinder at food max! Very disappointed with taste. I hope they will improve their Armenian coffee and not sell just black coffee. And price is way high than any other coffee.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Great coffee and very attentive staff. Overall a friendly vibe for both working and hang out with friends! The eggs in the breakfast bagel is extraordinary fluffy!! Highly recommend
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"They make a really good oat chai, and smell like they roast some pretty great coffee. Henry’s also makes one hearty breakfast burrito, full of meaty, potato-y goodness."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Heard about this place on Reddit in a “best coffee in SF” thread and I have to say we would mostly agree! Their in-house roastery in an open-kitchen format fills the whole place with the fresh fragrance of coffee. My favorite thing apart from their coffee was the black paper cups - very aesthetic. Overall, a very homey feel to this place. Would come back!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,What a cute little coffee shop! Loved their chai latte - a tad on the sweeter side. The medium size is quite big actually. The apple turnover is flaky and filled with tart apple sauce - they heated it up for me so just ask if you like your pastries warm. Super friendly service! There are plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,I grew up in the Sunset neighborhood and used to buy comic books down a block from Henry's House of Coffee.  Would never go in because I didn't really start to drink coffee until college?  I'm glad they are still around and have modernized the shop. Great cup of coffee and espresso.  Good price and good service.  Parking can be a little bit harder.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Best coffee place in San francisco Small batch coffee roasters From The original owner to he’s 3rd gen grandson incredible American made a proud family
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"A great family owned coffee shop.  They have tasty takeaway breakfast items. The breakfast burrito is huge.  And you buy whole beans, tea, etc as well."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,This was my go to place to get beans for my home espresso machine. It is extremely inconsiderate from them to change operating hours without updating the post on the door and their profile on apple maps.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Amazing coffee if you are really into good coffee, staff is super friendly and food is also nice, the pita with za’atar was great! I ended up buying some gridded coffee to have at home."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Needed a place to camp out and do my Education for Life class while my son had soccer in SF. Found this coffee shop with ample seating and easy parking for an early morning.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Delicious coffee & baked goods! Friendly service & atmosphere! I truly appreciate their continuing the family's passion of roasting Armenian coffees & brewing teas while sharing their passion with all of us, locals & visitors alike! Shnoragalem! (I also bought goodies to share with my friends!) ❤️ 🎄💙☕🎶 🇦🇲 🇺🇸"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Small place with good quality coffee and pastries. I got an onion & bacon croissant and it was delicious.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Excellent tasting coffee, friendly personably staff, rustic environment, wide variety of quality coffee choices, Chemex pour over, well worth the trip."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I got a large Latte which was fantastic. The microfoam was silky smooth, the espresso was nicely extracted, and it was a perfect treat for a rainy day. I would try this place out if you are looking for a new spot to try."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Used to be a really great coffee shop where beans are roasted right there every day.  Maybe owner changed several years ago?  Now it's just one of ordinary coffee shops you can find everywhere. Not bad but not very good either.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Great neighborhood place.  Smells are amazing when they are roasting coffee.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I went here recently to purchase coffee beans. The opening hours have changed. They close at 5PM. Nice place with a San Francisco Roaster in the back. I got light beans. If I remember correctly $18/pound, which is expensive but okay. I pulled good espresso shots. No bitterness. Good flavor, but Texture and Crema was a bit sub-optimal."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Great service! They welcome everyone with a warm smile and greeting and they know their regulars! They are so efficient in the way  they work! The coffee is great! All drinks are served in to-go cups probably because most of their customers get drinks to go but there is still some seating and outlets.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Good coffee and delicious bacon and onion croissant!  Wry good service - fast and friendly
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Delicious coffee and with so many pastries options to try.  My to go spot when it's laundry time.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,The best coffee! I love the Kona Mocha and asiago cream cheese bagels. Clean and relaxed environment.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,I felt at home with the outside kiosk. Henry ran a great business and handed it to his son. Peter is a great manager with great sales assistants
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Great cup of coffee. Good prices. I didn't have any food, but it looked good."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,I checked this place out after reading all the good reviews online. I almost missed the shop but the good coffee smell told me I was close. However my cup of coffee was weak and just didn't live up to the praises. I think I'll stick to Peets since their quality is the most consistent.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I always get a cup of their coffee every morning. They change their coffee of the day every once in a while so there are chances to try the coffee before you try the beans. I like the bella finca most. Seating can be scarce sometimes but I like the place a lot more after their remodel.  They also sell coffee cups and presses, and food."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"TLDR: both my drink order and my food order got taken by wrong people and we had to wait for them to remake our orders. Need a better system to avoid this problem.  The workers are nice and everything is decent. But there needs to be a better system to pick up your items, they may need to start calling out names for food or something. I ordered two drinks and a sandwich. The drinks came out first and not 20 seconds after, someone else took our drinks. They brought the iced latte back( they had ordered a hot latte) but for some reason kept our hot tea which the staff had to remake.  Then the sandwich came from a separate section and once again, our sandwich got taken, and again, they had to remake it for us.  Not a good customer experience but also bad for the company who is paying money to remake these items."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,What can I say … it is simply the very best coffee and I drink it everyday. Yum!!!
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Good place to get work done. Coffee is just fine, but it’s clean, Wi-Fi is fine, and has ample seating. Staff are friendly and there’s a free water station, bathroom, etc. Not too hot or cold. Got a cold brew"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Multiple tables. Outlets also with USB ports. Friendly staff. They have a 12 drink stamp card.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I really like this business and I’m glad to spend my coffee budget on a local, family owned operation. Twice I’ve reached out to Customer Service for order questions, and both times I received prompt, friendly, and accommodating responses. As for the coffee, Henry’s Blend is perfect. I’ve sampled brands cheap to expensive. It has the complex sophisticated taste of upscale coffee places, but without any bitterness."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Feel like a kid at a candy shop! Love this place! Met Mr Henry and shook his hand... it's so welcoming, cozy, accompanied by a variety of coffee scents"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I was compelled to write this review, not for the coffee, which was great, but for the service. The girl who served me was so thoughtful and genuine, it was really appreciated. I would definitely go back."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"CUUUTEEEE little coffee shop! This is one of the few places still offering indoor seating so it works! I like their chai latte and their breakfast items are wonderfulllllll! I always seem to be able to find a place to sit inside but I am NEVER comfortable because they insist on keeping the doors open and won't close them when you ask. I'd like to say that this is a small thing, but it really isn't. It's lovely to have a COZY environment. But it stays FREEZING in here. If there were other coffee shops offering indoor seating other than Starbucks, I'd switch in an instance. In fact, I just simply would not come back here at all. The service is truly hit or miss. There are some girls here that are GREAT and others who give off the energy that they don't want to be helping you at all. Sometimes, they're so into their conversations that asking them for things feels like you're interrupting something much more important than what you need as a customer. For these reasons, I am on the fence about giving 3/5 stars vs the 4. Out of all of the coffee shops out here, this one is actually one of my least favorite, and I prefer to get my coffee elsewhere in terms of flavor (personally). If they didn't have indoor seating (even though you're sitting in a freezer), I would never come back.  Again, this is my personal opinion. The place stays busy and they definitely have good pastries and great burritos. But with so many other coffee shops having better drinks and better service, it is going to take more than an indoor seat to make this the preferred coffee shop. My review would be different all-together if I didn't need a table to do homework at. I just simply would never return."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I tried Henry's Coffee for the 1st time. Ethiopian dark roast. I have had Ethiopian Harrar from another vendor in the past with a robust and pleasant blueberry flavor. Henry's advertised that this coffee has a chocolate covered cherry flavor, but I don't notice that. It is quite good however in a French press, and brewed as pour over. It did not do well in my Bialetti stove top. On the other hand I enjoyed it brewed in my la Pavoni espresso machine. Strong but no bite. I like it black. For me to recommend coffee I must enjoy it black. I certainly recommend this coffee. It was also delivered quickly."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Atmosphere is excellent, and it’s a great cafe vibe. Baristas were very fast to deliver at 2pm. Chai latte is delicious, although not as spicy as I’d like. Scone was soft and tasty, if not a bit small. Reasonably priced for SF. Will definitely come back!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,This is a very simple and straightforward coffee shop. No fancy decorations but everything is clean and elegant and well organized. The coffee was excellent. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination but even I could tell that the coffee beans they use are high quality and tasty. I also got a hot chocolate that was yummy. Prices are very fair. There are several tables with seating room for 14 people. The music is soft. I was able to study comfortably for a few hours.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,One of the best coffee bean roasters in all the city.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"My favorite Armenian coffee supplier, the quality is exceptional, truly master roasters wether it’s the “House blend”, “Lena”, “Lara”, or other Holiday additions. I order it from North Carolina and needless to say they pack it carefully and deliver it ASAP! Highly recommended"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Have been ordering Costa Rican light for years. Smooth, tasty and always consistently roasted to perfection. Quality and 2 day service from order to my home. It gets no better than this. What a way to start each day. Thank you ☕️"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"A gem of a coffee shop in the Outer Sunset. A simple and delicious cup of coffee for a good price, and a great assortment of pastries. Wonderful family owned business!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Great coffee roasted here. I typically buy a bag of beans for making drip coffee at home and enjoy a complimentary cup of coffee that comes with a bag of beans. Friendly staff, a great neighborhood spot."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Great, hand roasted beans. Friendly staff. Easy access by car, bus, bike or on foot. Nice quality pastries. Well organized system during pandemic. Slick little outdoor sip shack out front."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I am a longtime Henry's customer.  I am a weekly purchaser of roasted coffee beans, and a regular latte buyer.   He does excellent light roast coffee, I especially like the light roasted Sumatran.  The service is always professional and friendly and the vibe here is great.  Oh, and the Armenian food is yummy, too!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Visiting from out of town but had to start the morning off right with some delicious coffee. The owners immediately made us feel welcome and gave us a tour of their wonderful business and it reminded me of one of the most important things about life: family... and coffee, definitely coffee. I had the jasmine tea latte and my wife had the cold brew.  Both were delicious. My kids both had a hot chocolate with a chocolate cookie - can't go wrong. All in all, an excellent coffee shop."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Really great coffee in an awesome no-frills space.  The baristas are all super friendly and service is prompt.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Delicious coffee and food with great staff and nice vibe. It's a tad pricier than I'd like.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,I think this coffee shop deserves 5 stars but one thing was holding me back. That is their lack of seating. Otherwise I like them. The place feels retro and modern. Their service is attentive and pleasant. They roast their own coffee beans and people seem genuine and glad
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I have enjoyed Henry’s small batch roasted coffee for over 25 years.  He has worked with me on a special Kona blend over the years to keep it affordable and up to my expectations.  I come all the way from San Jose just to smell the roasting coffee. And replenish my supply of our favorite blends, one of which is Henry’s Blend.  Try it.  You will add it to your inventory."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,In the sunset neighborhood this is the best local roaster we have found. I am very impressed with the quality of the beans and the knowledgeable staff. They carry some truly unique varieties and roast everything in house. My go-to whenever we run out of beans at home and I need to make an emergency run. Henry's House of coffee is a local Institution and deserving of that title.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Walk in, take a DEEP breath with your nose and you will understand why you should always come here for beans and coffee drinks. My favorite local roaster without a doubt. Great, helpful staff. And if you get hooked to the beans (you will) and move away - don't worry, they have an online store for their beans. The owners are fabulous also."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Ordered some for my wife as she loves coffee (I can't so caffeine). She absolutely loved the coffee. Said it was robust and bold. She got the chocolate flavor. She definitely loves it....will get more no doubt
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Having just moved away from San Francisco, this is one of the places I'll miss most. Came here nearly every day for two years and never once had a bad experience. Always smells like freshly roasted beans (go figure) and they get their bagels from House of Bagels, which are truly excellent. Cannot recommend highly enough."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Opens at 6 (great considering shops closer to my place all open at 7). Fast, friendly, good Americano for $2.75. They have decaf espresso and sugar free syrup, both of which I appreciate and are not a guaranteed option in the hipster coffee shops that generally populate the area."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,I give them a chance every time and every single time they get my order wrong. This review is just for their service. Wash your ears please.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Henry's roasted coffee is the best in town, and the only place I'll get fresh roasted beans.  Really great! However I only rated 3-stars because of the barista's abilities at this cafe.  Nearly every visit when I'm picking up some of their great beans I'll also order a Latte or Cappuccino which is consistently very bad.  Unfortunately they're burning the milk, which kills the whole drink.  I keep hoping that it's just a fluke, but this has happened 4 of my last 4 visits.  If they just used a thermometer or tasted their own Cappuccinos they could fix the issue easily.  If you're looking to just stop in for a latte or cappuccino I would definitely say you're better off at one of the other local cafes.  For fresh roasted beans though, you can't beat Henry's!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I've been living in the Sunset my whole life, and nothing smells better than when Henry is roasting his coffee beans! The smell leaves a beautifully nutty aroma over the whole neighborhood. Trust me...its the best advertising that can be. Go in and buy a pound of his coffee (Bella Finca is my favorite) you'll be glad you did!!!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,What a treat! You can taste the love and family tradition roasted into these delicious coffee beans. My favorite flavor is Bella Finca which tastes like chocolate. We did a blind taste test with Philz and Henry's House of Coffee wins every time. Hands down the best coffee in San Francisco.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Cute coffee shop with a chill vibe. Quick and friendly service. Street parking only, but it was easy to find a spot. Prices are reasonable and portions are liberal.  Pastries are available but not a lot of other food options.  Highly recommend for a local or visitor. Can’t go wrong!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Cute, cozy shop, would've stayed there all day if I could have. You can tell this is a small, family run business just by the atmosphere and demeanor of the employees. Ordered some coffee online; it arrived quick and smelled delicious. Almost made me sad it was a gift, will have to order more to enjoy at home!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,+1 for their Earl Grey latte!! I randomly came in here one day and have since kept going back just for their Earl Grey latte. Great little shop with a huge variety of roasted coffee beans and it smells great inside. Friendly workers!
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"The coffee is great. The service is good. I've almost never had to wait in line. All good things, I only wish it felt more inviting. It's definitely just a place I go to pick up my coffee and go, not exactly a coffee shop hangout vibe."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I’ve never been a dark roast drinker, until I read some details about Henry’s HofC “Bella Finca”. Wow, is not a big enough word. This is amazing. Even has my wife during two cups per day rather than struggling through one. It’s amazing."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Definitely best in the area with artisinal varieties and it's a family owned business... Henry is typically there on site mentoring staff and his son is doing a masterful job of moving the brand and products into the modern stream.  Thanks to Henry's for half a lifetime of the best local cappuccino around.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I wanted to like this place, but I was unable to get past the sloppiness of the establishment and the lack of care and attention to detail in the interior appointments and goods for sale. A completely unpalatable espresso served in a to-go cup; uninviting pastries in plastic clam shells; cans of soda and sunnyD on display up front; unnecessary amount of shelving devoted to coffee making retail; nobody seemed to know what they were supposed to be doing behind the counter."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Got a cup of latte and a breakfast sandwich in a early morning. Their coffee has a strong cherry and wine smell and I think it’s good to try.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"What a wonderful throw-back to the neighborhood coffee house of yore. It appears like a ""hole in the wall"" from the street, your first impression that this may be a jewel in the rough, then you are met with the wonderful aroma of fresh...and I mean fresh...roasted COFFEE. Henry allowed us to smell the different roasted beans in large tins. We picked Ethiopian, Thailand, Kenya dark roast and the Vista blend to take back with us to Idaho. Every morning we have fond memories of the coffee house that Henry built. Lucky for Starbucks he is a small one-man shop, otherwise he would be a corporate-owned, mass marketed coffee establishment wreaking ball."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Awesome cozy spot to do work with some local coffee. Good wifi, nice staff, great lighting during the day, and GREAT CHILL TUNES. When I was there, they were playing chill hip hop, mostly instrumental. I pulled my Shazam out more than a few times."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I haven’t been to Henry’s shop in San Francisco but it is definitely on my list of places to go when I’m back in the area.  However, I am in love with Armenian and Turkish coffee.  Since my husband worked in the Middle East for 8 months I have come to appreciate good coffee.  I am Italian by nature and an espresso drinker but that doesn’t compare to the smoothness and taste of good Armenian coffee!  Which brings me to Henry.  I was on the hunt for good finely ground coffee for my new adiction and came across Henry’s place on Facebook.  I was immediately drawn in and must have watched his videos 100 times.  So at Christmas time I took the plunge and bought Henry’s dark roast Armenian coffee along with a gift set for a good friend of mine.  I was not disappointed and neither was my friend (who by the way never had Armenian coffee before).  She followed Henry’s video on how to make it and immediately texted me and said it’s was the best cup of coffee she has ever had.  I too had the same reaction.  The coffee was dark, rich, smooth and absolutely not bitter!  Definetly ordering more!  Our whole family drinks it!  Hopefully there is a trip soon back to San Francisco in the near future.  I sure would love to meet Henry!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Great local spot! Solid coffee and friendly staff.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Possibly the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. Outstanding!  The pastry wrap in place of a tortilla is genius.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I would give 3 stars and a half to this place. Don't know wasn't very pleasant with me, they had no refills but above all know very friendly. It is a regular coffee shop place. I expected something better. The coffee was OK but the experience wasn't as good as I would've imagined for a coffee shop that just opened."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Henry's House of Coffee is a local spot with a long history of roasting. This has been a family business for over 50 years and the tradition doesn't seem like it is going to end soon. While most see this as just a coffee shop, and yes they serve coffee, it is primarily a roaster to buy your coffee beans. Try a bag and taste the history."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Great coffee & espresso. They roast the beans here and have been doing it for years. Nice staff as well.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I visit Henry's several times per week. Great coffee beans roasted onsite. Coffee, pastries and sandwiches are all great, as well as the service."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Almond croissants were good, coffee was terrible."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,You can tell a lot about a shop by their cappuccino... And BOY do they make a good one ! Love the in house roasting and the espresso was very smooth.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"I jst started going here this week, I been here since M-F and will continue to come M-F, Great Coffee good service and fast!"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"We found out about Henry's House of Coffee a couple of months ago thanks to a family friend. We live nowhere near San Francisco, but we sure do enjoy a great cup of coffee however far away it may come from. Since we grind and brew fresh daily, this seemed like the perfect fit, i.e. ordering whole beans from a master roaster.  Generally, we would use a variety of whole bean selections from Starbucks. After drinking HHoC's selections, though, it's going to be very difficult to drink anything but HHoC coffee. So far we have had the chance to try 4 different coffee bean types from Henry's House of Coffee -- each a delight in its own right.  Whether you're a coffee snob or just want to enjoy a cup of joe the way nature intended, you should at the very least give their coffee beans a try."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"The breakfast burrito was pretty large, an unexpected delight. The pour over was nice, too.  To access the WiFi, you need to login with either Facebook or Instagram, though. And the Instagram integration doesn’t actually work."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Love the coffee here...well, latte to be precise. I always get to go, so can't comment on the ambiance, beyond the awesome aroma when Henry does the roasting in store."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Very nice staff and coffee!! I had their breakfast burrito which tastes pretty legit. They have Wi-Fi and outlets which is very much appreciated. So I recommend this place. 😊 …
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"All of the freshly roasted coffee, none of the hipster pretense. The food here's pretty solid too, especially the Armenian stuff. Also really inexpensive."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,One of the best coffee places in the city.  The coffee is wonderful but I'm addicted to the chai latte
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Specialty coffee place, with a few limited options for breakfast. Food wasn’t anything special, prices probably average for this city Parking around is limited"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,1st time here.  Very friendly and the coffee is great.  Will definitely be coming more often.
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Not a good experience, the girl preparing my order totally screwed it up, and didn't really care......I shall not return."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Maybe the best coffee in the city with the best prices! They remodeled and it looks great. Fast and nice service. Such good coffee ☕

Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"Since 1982, but the perfect blend of old world and modern. Great danish, too. Nowhere currently to recycle, might all be compostable."
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,"bad business practices going on in here not worth supporting, better off going down the street to literally anywhere else"
Henry's House of Coffee,1618 Noriega St,Forget Starbucks. Come to Henry's for great coffee and pick up some excellent roasted coffee beans that are roasted on premises.
