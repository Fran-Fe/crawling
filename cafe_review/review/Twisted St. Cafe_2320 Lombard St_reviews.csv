Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,A good place to take a nice breakfast. The horchata cold brew is a 10/10. The Acai bowl is good and the prices are okay. Smoothies are good. It's losing one star because the service was a little long and the breakfast bagel was well full but a little plain. I recommend.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,We visited for breakfast and it was lovely. Thankfully it wasn't busy because it is a small place. The presentation and taste were both exactly what we were looking for!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"First time here. Stopped by for brunch on the go. Ended up sitting outside. They actually have a number of outside tables. Got a Croissant Sandwich and an Acai Bowl. Sandwich as expected and tasted great. The Acai Bowl was on a whole different level. Wow, was it filling and amazing.  Full of healthy tidbits sitting atop a mountain of gelato.  Unbelievably delicious.  Could eat that thing any time of the day.  Will return."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"We stayed at the hotel next door, which didn't serve breakfast. So we came here. But before, we explored the area, and didn't find anything that looked better. We did not regret our choice, and the next day we came back. The avocado toast was super good. We have since tried to replicate it at home., Still n=good, but not as much."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Cute cafe for brekkie & coffee. Good place to grab food and also use the restroom for me.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"This place has amazing breakfast/brunch! I highly recommend the salmon avocado toast, the croissants and the molletes. Plus the staff is very nice and it is pet friendly… they even have treats for dogs!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Everything here is delicious! Thanks 😊 guys for you service..bagel 🥯 salmon perfect protein for a couple hours...
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Ordered a warm ham and cheese croissant and it’s the best croissant I’ve had this trip along the West Coast - flaky croissant and good ratio of pastry to ingredients. Will be getting this for breakfast the rest of the trip!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Had a wonderful experience. We are visiting and would recommend to anyone! Delicious food & lattes too! We got the breakfast bagel & it was delicious and filling! Loved the bacon. Also got the salmon avocado toast for the first time & it was so flavorful and tasty. Loved the atmosphere and design of the place! Had a wonderful experience with the staff, very accommodating, helpful and very friendly! 5 stars!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"I visited a few times for a morning coffee while staying nearby. Very friendly and welcoming (except for a visiting pigeon, who was politely escorted out)! The coffee and breakfast bagels were delicious!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Great cafe tucked in from the busy street. Love the coffee and small snacks which they have.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Great little cafe that turn out amazing food, fast.  We had the Breakfast Bagels, Bacon, Egg, Avacado and Cheese,  which were lovely.  It can get busy at popular times, but be patient, it's worth the wait."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Perfect spot 🤍! We had a breakfast, twice, and everyrhing was delicious! Thank you! …"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Delicious! Carefully prepared coffees and delicious avocado toast. Will certainly return. I might toast the toast a bit more but maybe that’s just me!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"I never write reviews, but I went here while my family was staying at the infinity. The baristas are the sweetest, friendliest people. I only drink tea, and I ordered the lavender vanilla matcha. I haven’t had a good matcha in the Marina yet, so I had low expectations. The matcha was thoroughly whisked, no chunks, and had the perfect amount of syrup added so it wasn’t too sweet. And the best part, it was only $4.50!!!! I get it with almond milk which makes it about $5, but still the most reasonable I’ve found. Can’t recommend this cute little cafe enough!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Decent coffee prices, specials are priced at about what you'd expect of San Francisco.  Food is fantastically good. Service is adequate in speed."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Almost no cream cheese on a cream cheese bagel :(. Horchata cold brew was pretty good though. Changing my review as they responded so kindly and quickly and gave more cream cheese the following time :).
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Simply an amazing spot! A must visit when in Marina district.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Macha latte was terrific and the food came out quickly and was tasty. Fun selection of hot sauce.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Stumbled upon this restaurant and glad that we did! Very friendly staff and courteous service. Had the best personally customized croissants and bagels in SF. Would highly recommend for breakfast/brunch!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"3.5 stars. Service was super friendly and nice! Our cappuccinos, matcha, and iced americanos were so yummy. The only thing that knocked off some stars is that the croissants were very dry."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Breakfast bagel was the best bagel I’ve had in a long time. So fresh and so delicious.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Small, unassuming spot with some indoor seating. Breakfast bagel was amazing! I also ordered the vanilla lavender latte with oat and that was so good!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"The best avocado toast hands down. Incredible!! The best coffee in SFO, too. Amazing!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Delicious latte and bagels, worth the trip in the rain"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,We ordered the avocado toast and a bagel with salmon and cheese. Both were really good!! I would highly recommend.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Second time ordering and this could really be one of the best salmon avocado toasts I’ve ever had 😋 …
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"The bagel avocado bacon super yummy n fresh, enjoy it very much, staffs very friendly n helpful 👍"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Ordered a smoothie with OAT milk & reiterated 3x that I wanted oat milk. It took abt 20 mins for this smoothie, while I waited I ordered an egg & cheese for my partner, which turned out to be fast food quality & We threw it out after leaving. I had finished the smoothie while waiting on that & it only took 15 mins after the smoothie for me to be completely sick to my stomach, scrambling to find a bathroom. I spent $21 here! was very clear about order & patiently waited for 20-30 mins and got sick. Was looking for a quick healthy bite. 🤢Staff was nice, but the place jammed up."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Detour here for coffee on our way to golden bridge. Flat white was so so. Cold brew was a disappointment.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Really enjoyed the Horchata Iced Coffee.   Excellent pastries and wonderful service made for an exceptional experience
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,This is a cozy cafeteria. The bagels here are really delicious. The service is good.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Hi 👋🏼 local here. This place is for all the tourists staying at the hotels nearby. If you’re looking for a genuine SF spot, this isn’t it. They’re kind and the service is quick but the quality of the coffee is very subpar for this city. We have a booming coffee scene — check out the likes of St Franks, Blue Bottle, Ritual, Reveille, etc for better quality beverages.  Edit: In response to the company’s comment below — oh no 🙈 it’s even worse that you have Ritual’s beans! That means that you folks have good quality beans and still aren’t producing a good product."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Stayed at the hotel a block away, which didn't serve breakfast in the morning. So I strolled here. The breakfast bagel was super good. Most def I am coming back someday to explore more on the menu👍"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,The Salmon and Avocado on Sourdough was superb - so fresh. Great smoothie as well.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,I ordered a bacon egg and cheese Asiago bagel for lunch and went to sit outside in the sun while they made my order. My friend received her order at the outside table very quickly but I had to go back in and ask where my order was. Turned out it was shift change and the person leaving didn’t give instructions on the current orders/customers waiting. The iced chai latte was already very sweet and almost tasted like chai out of a Tetra Pak from the store. Overall not impressed with my experience or food there.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Very bad food and mediocre coffee. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately the quality of the food and coffee does not compare to other nearby areas. The food and coffee they serve is easy to replicate at home. If I’m going to spend money to go out, it needs to be a step above what I can make in my own kitchen. Twisted street did not deliver."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Great orange juice and super fun Instagram likes count machine!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Quick on the food but 15  minutes on the coffee  very small place had to wait outside 😕
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,The food here is phenomenal for the price. Everything is super fair and i dont think you’ll find a better breakfast place anywhere in the city. Service is fast too!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Perfect lavender vanilla latte. Cute shop that has all the provisions.
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,The golden milk latte was really good. The avacado toast was really fresh
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,I ordered a Breakfast Bagel and it was very tasty. Then my wife and daughter sat down with a Acai Bowl and wow! I had to have one. The Acai Bowl was one of the best breakfast meals we've ever had. Plenty there to fill you up too! Thanks for the good foods and friendly staff!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Great place for a quick grab and go coffee. Seating is a nice outside patio. The salmon bagel was delicious!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Let's start with just perfectly delicious espresso. Coffee and croissant were amazing as well. Friendly staff and quick professional service made for an enjoyable late breakfast. When in SF,  I will now always stop by this wonderful cafe."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,If you're willing to spend three dollars and fifty cents for a cup of coffee you're welcome...
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Great spot to grab a bite & drink. The ham & cheese croissant hit the spot (I’m not big on eggs so love that it was just ham & American cheese), and my husband and I split a smoothie which was perfectly sweet and really filling. Also grabbed some bottled drinks and snacks for a long car ride later. We live nearby so will be back!"
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Delicious , huge açaí bowl, super tasty coffee and really friendly service! Great little spot on Lombard with strong wifi and outlets if you need to get some work done."

Not only that, food is amazing, 10x better than what you would find at any other coffee place in SF. Tip: order the Acaí bowls they recently added, my daughter loves them."
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,Stumbled upon this restaurant and glad that we did! Very friendly staff and courteous service. Had the best personally customized croissants and bagels in SF. Would highly recommend for breakfast/brunch!

Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,I love how this family owned spot is so convenient for me right before work. Mark and Ana are so sweet and welcoming every time I come thru. I even saw them packing a bunch of bag lunches for a non profit organization one day. :) My morning cold brew and breakfast bagel sandwich are always a delight. You must try their Horchata Cold Brew and Banana Chai Smoothie as well!
Twisted St. Cafe,2320 Lombard St,"Hidden gem! This place has an amazing selection of coffee and food options. The owners are super friendly and they mix a fantastic version of cold brew horchata! If you're catching an early morning bite, try the molletes! You'll thank me later :)"
