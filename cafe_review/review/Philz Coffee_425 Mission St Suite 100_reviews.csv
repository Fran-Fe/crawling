Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"It was my first time here and staff were really helpful. Great coffee and breakfast wraps! I had the Sweet Harmony. Nice blend. A little on the sweet side because of the oat milk I think. But that's just me. My son loved it. I I've also had the cold brew. I liked that, too. (I came back!) Great space as well! And dog-friendly! There were 2 well behaved pups when we were there. 😃(Check out the panoramic photo and you’ll see one of the pups!)"
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"OMG. The coffee was amazing. I got the mojito. They put real mint leaves in it. It was so delicious! We walked around the mission district afterwards and looked at murals, I got a hot coco. It had to be the best I've ever had. They had a few tables, large enough to share. I would totally go back!"
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"I've been here twice and both times were a memorable experience. The staff is fun and attentive, the food and coffee is great and it's a go-to when I'm in the area. Also, check out their gluten free donuts! Yyuuummm."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,This store has the worst customer service. I have waited for coffee for more than 30 minutes on several occasions. Once I forgot my phone and wallet and was given grief for wanting to pay with cash. Totally unacceptable and will not be spending my money there anymore.
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Half an hour before closing, it was necessary to argue about using the toilets… even though we were consuming coffee… we insisted on using it, the employee turned around and said a certain unfriendly word… a-hole… unbelievable! where’s the friendliness gone?! coffee is ok."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,Tiny Banana bread and fruite Danish were so delicious.  Coffee was good too.  Staff were super fun and sweet.  They made my children feel welcomed.
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,man i think I've had over a hundred philtered souls by now. ICED NO SUGAR MEDIUM CREAM. Always.  big shout to all the g's grinding those beans.  this is my favorite coffee ever. can you believe that? i usually hate chains if it isn't Mac Donalds. when we IPO I'll push hard to hire these guys in to the in-house Philz café of my skrillion dollar company.  oh.. food here is a bummer except for the banana bread but who cares that's not what you should go there for anyways.
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Located across from Happy Lemon under Salesforce Park. It's a full coffee shop with seating, outlets, and cold brew.  Solid coffee as always. I saw people working and there were outlets all along the window ready to work."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"I like putting my own sugar in my coffee.  I like cashiers whose know neighboring places or who at least ask their co workers, as opposed to starring blankly and shaking their head.  Made to order pour over coffee is fine but please let me sweeten it myself.  The $6 chocolate babka was okay."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,Its all about the coffee and the coffee is great!   The food items are fine.
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"The Caucasian male staff, short(about 5’5”), pale and thin,  was incredibly rude. Gave me hard as rock bagels, shut the store down 10min early and said “if you are not happy you can ask for a refund later”."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Love the coffee, hate the service. Don’t even think about using the mobile app, you will consistently be forgotten. 2nd time this week I’ve had to remind the baristas about my order 10-15 mins after it should be ready."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Long long wait for coffee, we paid but left after a 30 minute wait..."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,The service here is insanely slow. I frequent the 24th street mission philz and I’ve been to a couple in South Bay and DC and never experienced one quite like this one.
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"As a tourist from Seattle, Philz is a go-to for me when I visit the Bay. This location is greatly situated and seemingly in an area of the city that doesn't have many coffee options. Will be back."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Super friendly and helpful staff, and my order was delicious!"
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Savory, robust and rich - everything a coffee place should be! I enjoyed watching them grind up the beans for my order."
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"I love Philz! This location is right below Salesforce Park. Try the mint mojito, so good!"
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,Great vibe and coffee! Tons of seating and outlets to work. Bathrooms were also very nice 😁
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,Absolute disgrace of customer service. It's amazing how unwilling people are to help you. They just get a bad attitude and don't do anything to be off any service. Avoid this place
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"Everybody else enjoyed their coffee. Me not so much. Nothing special, just coffee. Ok jokes SC"
Philz Coffee,425 Mission St Suite 100,"I was looking for a coffee when i came across this incredible place, first time i had been to a Philz and you can be sure im coming back, not only that the coffee is great but the passion for service is amazing, they detailed roast flavors and recommendations to help me find a perfect coffee that im enjoying right now, you should be proud of the staff guys! Thanks!"
