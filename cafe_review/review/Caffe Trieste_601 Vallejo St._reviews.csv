Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I absolutely loved this place. It’s so unique and historic. Definitely a place that you should check out if you are visiting the city or even if you are a local. They are packed but the service is fast and super friendly. They have a lot of syrups for the coffee which was surprising since it looks rather classical. Good choice of pastries and drinks in general. Overall was a good experience and if you’re a foodie and a caffeine addict, you most definitely will enjoyed it. Plus the seating and the neighborhood are inviting. Great latte and the ham and cheese croissant was on point. Definitely will go back on my next holidays in the States ❤️‍🩹"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"There's a lot of history at the Caffe Trieste, it even has a Wikipedia page. Opened in 1956, it was the first espresso coffee shop on the west coast. It was a hangout for famous poets and writers of the Beat Generation such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.  Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for The Godfather here.  The cafe has a cool vibe, with plenty of photos of celebs who have visited, a great mural, and cozy indoor and outdoor seating perfect for people watching. Definitely a must-visit coffee shop in North Beach. Authentic old time Italian character.  The place gets very busy and a line will definitely form. With just two people working, it might take a while to get your order, but be patient and enjoy the atmosphere. The coffee is quite good and there are lots of pastries to choose from. IMPORTANT: they only accept cash, so you’ll need to make a stop at an ATM."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Stumbled into this charming cafe for dessert while in San Fran for one night. The vibe was amazing. The young man behind the counter talked me into have a cappuccino, which was probably the best I’ve ever had. We tried the Baklava, the Boston cream pie, Canoli and key lime pie. Thank you for making our last night in the city one to remember."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,This espresso tastes exactly like in Southern Italy! Really friendly place with varieties of pastries and so good coffees. It’s ideal place to have a breakfast.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,01/06/2023  We went there at the night time. There were a band inside that was playing a nice Italian theme! The service was awesome. Our order was ready in 5-7 minutes! We order mocha ☕️ with whip cream and their infamous tiramisu! And was soooo delicious!!!!  Overall we had very good time! Thank you so much for the lovely experience ❣️
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"We moved some chairs and a table (there were plenty) to right by the door in the shade with a charming view of Grant and Vallejo Streets. The help was helpful and friendly even though busy and patrons were nice, too. Seem to get some locals (we do live in SF but not in the neighborhood). Cappuccino and ""Snowball"" pastry (with jelly and custard inside, ~$6) were excellent. We got in before the prices were raised (1p on Sunday) for the delightful music, so we tipped instead. My partner is a music aficionado and said band members had been playing for Caffe Trieste for decades. Can't think of a better North Beach experience."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"- Great Italian style coffee shop and deli - the best espresso I had in the Bay Area. Also, the cinnamon rolls and the cannoli are among the best I had. Highly recommended."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,I only drank the double espresso. Very good espresso it was exactly like I had in Italy. I didn't have time for a pastry. Please remember to bring cash.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great little Italian cafe in North Beach. Historic little venue with great coffee and fabulous cakes. Service is great too. Also has a small deli connected a well. Only one toilet for M and F so can be a wait.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Place with great, old schooled atmosphere, like in crowded street in Italy. Really good coffee and delicious cannoli."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Awsome, super. Fantastic. That was great coffee and tiramisu. You feel all the   Character n  good vibes. There is out seat as well, people super friendly, the guy was working almost know everyone n aware of their order n favorite. I marked the cafe in my map to back there anytime im in the area. The only issue is they accepting just cash. No card"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Love this coffee shop, it does feel italian ☺️(from an European)"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Such a charming little cafe! We stopped for a quick breakfast and enjoyed some breakfast burritos that were delish! I had to get the fresh squeeze orange juice which was amazing! My mom had the ice tea which again was delicious!  The carrot cake!!!! It is by far the best I have had. It is moist and filled with just the right amount of allspice and the cream cheese is not too sweet. The crunch from the walnuts are perfect. I had to stop one more time before we left SF and get 3 pieces to go!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Cute cafe with a very local feel. Great sweet treats and coffee
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Excellent coffee & pastries. Cozy, Italian-American vibe. Apparently Ford Coppola wrote parts of “The Godfather” here. Beware: tough parking and cash only (ATM inside). Caffe Au Lait and Carrot Cake FTW! Sunday afternoon concerts! ($7 extra per drink for musicians ♥️)"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Strong delicious Italian espresso! Feels like a time machine when you step in the door. Low key, humble ambiance inside and some outdoor tables as well. Got to people watch some older, cigar- smoking, Italians that made it all the more authentic experience! Just next door is a little shop to buy beans as well! We had a breakfast burrito here for $5 that was delicious, too. My husband enjoyed an indulgent pecan dessert bar. It is cash only and they have an ATM inside."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,This place is like a time machine. It transports you to Italy! The coffee is strong. Also got a breakfast sandwich which is good.  They only accept cash so be sure to have some on you or you can also use the ATM inside.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Awesome atmosphere and service! The quality of the coffee is excellent. The tiramisu was great as well.  If ever I am back in SF, I know where I will be getting my cappuccino."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Great coffee. Got a cappuccino and a cafe au Lait. The pastries were good too. Couldn't find parking outside on a Sunday after 6, so had to take away. but the cafe looked nice inside. Would go here again."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Authentic Italian bar, a trip back in time to Italy in the 60s. Great coffee!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Very busy coffee shop that only accepts cash. The line moved slowly and the coffee was nothing different or memorable. And expensive too. The area behind the counter was messy as well.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Lovely coffee tucked in the Italian neighbourhood. We stopped by for coffee after lunch.  Loved the old quaint decor of the place and how comfy it was. Too comfy, in fact as we struggled to get a table :P . Didn't try their desserts but coffee was good. Want to to come back for a longer better experience and to try out more of their stuff!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Just outside of China town this cafe must be one of the oldest in the city. Cash only, but the pastries and espresso are worth it"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Of all the cafes in SF, it's easy to tell what's a tourist traps, what's to sell the vibes, and what is a true gem that locals and ""regulars"" frequent.  This place falls in the last category. The breakfast burrito was really good but the Mocha and latte are unreal! There's a real sense of neighborship and the staff seeing strangers as friends. Being tourists in SF, Paul took the time to sit with us and gave us food and sightsee advises. He had even left us with his contact info to text him in case we had any questions.  Would not hesitate to go back to say hi to a new friend of ours when we visit again, maybe we will end up going back before our trip ends."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Just wow! So amazing beverages. I ordered fantasia hot chocolate and guess what? The best! I like the sense of this coffee shop and the art they post all across the walls. Of course it's in the heart of downtown so you will try to find a parking but it's worth it.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,It can get really crowded. You can wait up to 15 min to order. Anyways is a must visit Wifi password(July 2022): holiday2021 Coffee + pastry or sandwich: ≈ $12 per person
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"It is a small but very nice boutique Café in San Fransisco.There are both indoor and outdoor tables in the Café. If you like some Italian coffee and pastry, you can visit the Cafe Trieste. However, you can find something more than a Café but some memories related with some celebrities. I did enjoy the paintings on the wall."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,An older man recommended this place to me as I was visiting for fleet week in the navy. I must say that I am glad he did. The espresso drinks here are very good and exactly what I expect when I think of a caffe with this much history. I recommend it to all who enjoy espresso and lattes. Way better than big chain coffee shops.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The hot drinks were great ☕️ 🫖 .. and so we’re pastries 🥮 🥐 .. great breakfast overall (a bit pricey) One of the members of staff comes across a bit cold.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I love it , it’s old classic place 🤍"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Long time customer at the San Francisco Cafe.  Cool people.  Cool locals.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Cash only. Cute cafe for a quick pick me up. Not much in the way of fat free or sugar free options. I had iced tea.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,A classic spot in the heart of North Beach. Good cappuccinos at a pretty regular price. The service was super fast. Cash only
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Historical, Italian coffee shop. Famous for people writing screenplays and books there. Neat spot to spark up a discussion about history and art. Latte very watery and bitter."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Please do not order iced coffee here! It taste like water downed coffee without any flavor. But i enjoyed their Cappuccino! Also, cash only."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"8oz burnt, stale drip coffee for $2.75 and then they don’t give me change and charge me $3? I asked for cream and sugar and they only gave me a little milk. It’s cash only and the atm has a $3 charge to withdraw. The tables were all dirty. Don’t waste your money."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is a classic, Italian style coffee shop in North Beach. It's not your typical modern coffee shop with fancy lattes and capuccino, but it's like taking a step into Italy and enjoying a good coffee amongst great ambiance."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great atmosphere laid back  . Barrista was awesome great service.  Great coffee ☕️
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"A hidden gem in the maze of San Francisco. Authentic Italian cafe, where the owner and clients speak Italian. Beautiful fresque on the wall. The expresso and Italian sodas are delicious."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Loved the old school atmosphere here. We had coffee and tiramisu. Coffee was strong and good!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Very good coffee selection and taste. Expect Italian standard and quality which is not given for granted in the US. Café has an authentic charme. Large selection of pastries.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Awesome location, small coffee shop with great and authentic coffees"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Classic Italian coffee shop. You can't pass up this shops cozy atmosphere set in a friendly  neighborhood, this place reminds me of Grandma's house during the holidays. Very busy on the weekend."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Historic vibe and great location. The cappuccino was tasty but a little bitter
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Wonderful coffee and fabulous ambience of legendary SF cafe! Francis Ford Coppola actually wrote some of the screenplay of The Godfather here.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I walk into the Cafe, the line is long, I wait, get a coffee with milk, debate on a breakfast burrito or a almond crossiant, get a burrito. Wait awhile for the burrito, sipping the coffee and it isn't great or close to good. I've gotten more excitement out of instant coffee. I wait 10 minutes no yell for the burrito. I looked at the counter and see a bag wrapped but there jam on the wrapper. I open it up, it's the burrito. ""Thanks??"" I said no response. I bite into it and got 2 bites before my stomach flipped, it tastes nothing close to food. Awful. I see the appeal for low prices, and the landmark of the city but it doesnt carry its weight it gold."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Great espresso! Good cakes, a little too sweet though. Overall great place for a quick coffee!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,It is uncomfortable to get only cash but Coffee was great !!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Overrated coffee, too strong latte 😕"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"We live in 2023, respect humanity! Racism Cafe Dirty! Educate your family about cultures and respect others colors"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,While it was ok.  I ordered a hot chocolate if some sort that didn’t taste at all like hot chocolate it tasted like it had espresso powder in it.  No thanks.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Oh my dear goodness that baklava!! 😍 Live music was great too!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"What a cool coffee shop. I was exploring Little Italy when I stumbled upon this little gem. I went on a Sunday and they had live music as you can see in the photo posted.  I had a Caffe Latte and it was super good and strong, very typical Italian Ristretto. I did not try the pastries but they looked pretty good too. The atmosphere is chill, but an older crowd. Recommend."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The coffee is the strongest in the area. Best cookies in town. Not recommended for people with cleanliness OCD.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Really good tea and coffee spot, open late, nice vibe and staff. Very reasonable prices, good loose leaf tea.  Had the apricot jam biscuit and the baklava, both pretty good."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Dirty! Horrible customer service and not pleasant at all, besides one worker who explained what they had. Cappuccino is way too burnt, and tea was not good at all. Take your business elsewhere, there are plenty of better coffee/cafes around SF."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Amazing experience! Good food within a historic place. The attendance better than everything, very kind to me as a foreign coming from Brazil. Thank Mr!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Delightful expresso doble, mocha bianco, rugelach chocolate, and a sprinkled sugar cookie. We didn't know we were sitting in such a historic place... Watched champions league soccer and enjoyed the ambience"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Surprisingly good coffee and some of the bakeries are fairly priced and delicious. Only downside is that this place is cash only.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,A personal favourite of mine despite not being a local. The North Beach neighbourhood is full of charm and this place embodies this feel. Go here for a good coffee and a pastry and read a local paper. At night you might occasionally find a number of guests outside on the corner listening to music and enjoying the evening.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Vibe and history of the place is enchanting. It’s cool to sit and sip in this cafe.  Coffee is good! I didn’t get anything to snack on but also looks good.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Nice caffe latte and the service is lovely.  They have an assortment of pastries if you like sweet stuff and the outdoor seating is relaxing.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Good (italian, strong) coffee and good bakeries. It's a little bit of Italy in SF."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Came here a few years ago and it was great. Unfortunately the barista was incredibly grumpy this morning, complaining that I had taken a photo of the facade before I came in. Her concern was that I was photographing patrons without asking (not the case, and obviously so - the place was almost empty at 6:45am), but there’s a wrong way to give customers (or anyone) feedback, and this was it."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Absolutely loved the double jolt espresso here. It's a double shot with Bailey's along with homemade whipped cream. The combination was out of this world, and the price was reasonable as well (maybe even cheap for San Francisco).  The staff was also friendly and welcoming which added to the experience."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Read that this coffeehouse offered wifi and lots of charging stations so I may work on my laptop. Showed up and immediately noticed a shabby, rundown cafe. Nevertheless, I wanted to give it a chance.  I ordered a decaf with milk and it was quickly made, very delicious. However, customer service leaves a lot to he desired. Although the man who prepared my coffee was nice enough,  he was like a robot - trying to get people to order quickly.  But don't get me started on the Asian woman! She was horrible. She had this look on her face like she hated everyone. She cleaned the tables with attitude, and when I asked if there was an outlet I could use where I was sitting, she said she didn't know! And then pointed to 2 outlets that there was no way I could reach from where I was sitting and mumbled something as of she didn't speak English. After a while, I got up to get a cookie and she was behind the counter. She wasn't friendly or courteous, just looked like she had to be there. I believe she would have thrown the cookie at me if she had a chance. After a while I could hear her speaking English without an issue when she took other people's orders, but still not friendly.  Since I couldn't charge my laptop because other patrons were using the tables, I just waited until the battery drained and left. Not sure if I should have given 2 stars. Bummed out because the cookies were good, but I may not return."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"A classic cafe in North Beach. It feels like a trip back in time. Make sure to check out the celebrity pictures on the walls, and see what's available in the jukebox. I like getting a pot of loose leaf tea. The cappuccino is also very good, and many of the pastries can feed two.  A word to the wise: it's cash only here."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,An SF Classic in North Beach.  Truly delicious late afternoon latte.   Plenty of outdoor seating.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Not a lot of places have ring pastry, but caffe Trieste does.  Almond and Raspberry!  Sometimes you have to ask for them because out on display.  It’s a cash only establishment but it has an ATM inside.  The coffee is definitely old school style.  Not sure how to explain that other than it isn’t like at a modern coffee shop.  They do things their own way and are not trying to be like anyone else.  I recommend watching other people order and observing what they get before you approach the register because things move fast once you’re in line.  This place can get crowded so I wouldn’t bet on being able to sit down at a table during busy hours.  They do have free WiFi."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Inaccurate business hours, I wanted to make the bookend for my trip and showed up at 6:04pm. Posted hours were closing at 9:00pm. It was clearly closed for some time before I got here as no one was in the shop cleaning it.  After receiving high praise from Coffee Gurus back home I can't give this establishment a higher rating until they start posting more accurate hours and wasting people's time. If this was a COVID change, it's been three years, I feel like everyone should have updated this by now."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Best coffee we had in 10 days! Typical place, original juke box, excellent coffee, obviously the best place in the area if we consider the line up at 9 am!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Sunday afternoon I actually found a legit parking spot, Caffe Trieste is the best coffee shop in SF:"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Caffe Trieste is my go-to spot in San Fran. It's authentically Italian beverages and pastries make it indispensable. It was founded in 1958, so time has tested it's worth. This morning at 10 AM they played live music - mandolins, etc. They also have a juke box and you can chat up the cashier."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Old San Francisco can be found here.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Ask for whipped cream, this place makes their own and it's delicious. Love the outdoor seating."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Nice selection of coffee drinks. OK house blend, lots of seating. Key Lime pie was amazing👍"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,A lively spot with people hanging out enjoying the sun. Nice for a beer
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Unprofessional and slow staff/barista, baklava wasn’t fresh, charged more than in the menu, cash only.."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Good coffee, good sweets, excellent people watching. It is what it is….just go."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,If you like crabby old man actually reading and protecting their newspapers this is your place.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Classic San Francisco little Italy that only Cafe Trieste can bring. Delicious desserts and cappuccino. Live music at times that sounds great.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"A great place for coffee and desserts, it's cash only so be prepared"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Not recommended.  Rude staff. If he wants to work at the sale shop, at least he should look at customer and say hello instead of looking at his phone. I wanted to buy beans but turn around right after saw his attitude.  ATM charges $3 fee. There's no explanation why they accept cash only. Barista was suprised when I give him credit card. Even after pandmic they touch bills and make coffee with same hands. Is it safe? hmm.  Coffee and atmosphere were acceptable but overall, uncomfortable experience."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,First espresso location in 1956 on West Coast. Great neighborhood spot with Italian opera and exquisite good and drinks
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Great caffe. Fun scene, outdoor seating during COVID. Love their cappuccini and cornetti al mandorle. Highly recommend."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"A place with lots of history and memories for older people! The whole area is a lot more tourist oriented than I had experienced in the 1980's. Doesn't feel as original as it was then. Probably need to visit the cafe during the evening and it being in a weekend in order to compare. Time changes everything inevitably. Anyway, the coffee is still great and the people are very friendly as always. A Must visit place."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Just around the corner near Chinatown… great coffee and sweets ☕️❤️ enjoying SFS
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Fantastic spot to enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend. The staff is friendly and the coffee is inexpensive. Especially compared to chain coffee shops! Try the spiked coffee with Irish cream alcohol. It's great for a hangover. 😂 …
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,5 star coffee great food great entertainment you don't taste it love the place you and my grandma took me there too that's how many generations we're going there 5 now
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Coffee and live music on the street, for real Italian taste! The espresso si delicious"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Love Caffe Trieste's mocha, $5.5. It's one of the best tasting mocha because of their strong espresso, semi-sweet Guittard cocoa, Glover milk and homemade whipped cream. 👍  Cash only."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Cash only and incredible old school Italian vibes all day long. I had a vanilla latte and biscotti, super enjoyable while sitting on their street patio"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Got the baklava and a cappuccino, and I was disappointed with both.  Maybe i ordered the wrong thing, the tables weren't too clean, and service was lousy.  I had high expectations since it seems to be a SF institution, but don't think it's worth going again."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great old school coffee. Deep and nutty. Wonderful place to sit down and spend a bit of time. The chocolate on the eclair was very flavorful-the rest of the eclair was not bad-excited to try other food next time. Would love to come again. Cash only.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,More of a tourist trap the place to catch the creative writers vibe but it's worth the look anyway
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is place reminds of olden times. You might find novelists, authors, poets sipping a cup of coffee. Their espressos and cappuccinos are worth trying. Plus, it’s less than 5 mins walking from Chinatown."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Super cool cafe. The decor is awesome and the overall vibe is relaxed and fun. Lots of seating, hung out with 10 people in the back. Lines do get a bit long and it's cash only, but that's the only downsides."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"We ordered an double shot espresso and cappuccino which were made quite quickly. Sat outside and enjoyed our drinks in their glassware instead of paper to-go cups, which was a plus. No complaints, both tasted delicious and gave us the caffeine boost we needed to walk the last bit back to our hotel in downtown."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Great coffee, delicious croissant and cake. The atmosphere is calm and very pleasant. You feel relaxed and calm in this place."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I’ve been going here since I was 17. Great coffee, excellent people watching and love the house made desserts…at least they taste in house."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"By far my favorite coffee shop here. The staff is so polite and on top of every order. their coffee is exceptional. Plus, a delicious selection of desserts."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"You have my full and unequivocal support! I am a client of yours, and I am very satisfied with the services you have. Your coworkers were very polite and considerate. They were both capable of promptly carrying out customer orders. It's a calming and fun sensation. This coffee shop is ideal for those looking for solitude."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"You have my unequivocal and passionate blessing! I am a customer of yours, and I am very happy with the services you have. Your colleagues were very courteous and thoughtful. They were both capable of easily completing the orders placed by the customers. It's a relaxing and pleasurable sensation. This coffee shop is suitable for those wanting peace and calm."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Our favorite Coffee house in San Francisco. We always make a point to visit when we are in town.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"What a cool spot.  The vibe of the shop was cool, perfect espresso and great location.  Had coffee outside and enjoyed the atmosphere."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is the coffee shop you always want but never get. Friendly locals, authentic atmosphere, great espresso. Makes me want to move here and make this my morning stop!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Best espresso in town so far! This café has a really nice italian flair and the service is very friendly! Definitely coming back to this place!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Had a great vanilla latte there. Came out the perfect temperature and was happy that I went here. Definitely worth your tone.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"First and foremost, I'd want to thank my wonderful buddy for introducing me to this coffee shop! You are very outstanding! When I found out about this excellent coffee store, I was overjoyed! You can't blame me for being a coffee connoisseur! Everything on their menus looked delicious! Thank you very much, gentlemen, for your wonderful service!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Beautiful cafe, very busy but on top of it staff. I wish it wasn’t just cash only but eh. The caffe latte was pretty good, along with the cannolis, tiramisu, and eclair. I wouldn’t say everything was perfect but it was pretty good for the price range."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I came here with my friend and I tried ravioli. It was delicious. The place is small but enough for people coming, the service was good. You have tables outside. They close early so try to go before 8pm to dinner."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,**they are cash only**  great selection of coffee and a great place to unwind. really good pastries as well! i will definitely be coming back!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Lovely caffe!! Really recomend service and deliciuos caffe. Live italian music during afternoon. A must go in San francisco
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Trieste is a place where you can go to spend an hour getting lost in a good cup of coffee, often accompanied by the serenading voice of some musician or other. A San Francisco staple."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"A great espresso, neighborly and the humble chocolate rugala are the best I’ve ever had"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Had a wonderful latte! Delicious, beautiful latte art (could not photograph it, as I took the first sip and it wasn't as pretty). Lots of great coffee / espresso options along with pastry choices of all nationalities.  Great Deco with nostalgic photos of yester year. A great place to enjoy some morning Joe, feel like a North Beach local and begin the day. Filled with locals, tourist and happy people."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"For me, this is the best place to have some coffee. The ambiance is really great, the customer service is top-notch, and all the staff was very accommodating. The coffee and cookies were a little bit pricey but once you taste it, you will understand why. I would definitely come back here soon with all my friends and workmates. Highly recommended!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I like the espresso, they have a few pastries but nothing temping."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I strolled in here after stopping at Molinari's Deli. As a coffee lover and home brewer/geek I find it's always helpful to taste a coffee or espresso by a daily craftsman's hand. Without criticizing the 'new coffee' world, where they talk more about their nitrogen this or their sustainably-sourced that, Caffe Trieste walks the walk and produces a helluva great espresso! I've not had a dopio this good in many years. It was bold, it was sweet like espresso should be (without sugar), it was thick with crema and just so satisfying. The place also has plenty of charm and atmosphere for kicking back and people watching. It will be on my list every time I visit the city."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Landmark coffee shop and a great people watching spot.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Excellent coffee and friendly staff, great place to chill and enjoy it. Cash only and have an ATM if needed"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The granddaddy of them all! Claims to be the home of the first espresso machine on the west coast of California. It's an iconic bohemian coffee shop of the Beat and pre-Hippie era. I was lucky enough to attend the live concerts on occasion. A great place to sit and people watch and savor the rich history of the location! There is a lot of outside seating now. It makes for a very festive weekend location
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Wonderful espresso and what a historic spot! Was so excited to visit.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,very good coffee. cash only which is a bit annoying.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Sweet spot, BUT will not steam breve milk (half n half). I've traveled throughout the USA, and it's a first in the heart of North Beach in SF?! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,It's historic. That alone says it all. Great feel to just being there to relax and feel the 1950s+ vibes. Of course the coffee is impeccable. And I am quite satisfied with the square pizza slice I had for my light lunch. Bonus is that the jukebox has Italian opera available.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Wonderful coffee shop with a lot of history! This is where all the poets and musicians came back in the day when North Beach was the artist place and it shows in the mural of pictures on the wall. Their lattes, mochas, and coffee are incredibly flavorful and they have a variety of dessert items available in the evenings (the time of day I have ever come). This is a great place to people watch, write, or sketch while you enjoy your drink."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Coffee is nowhere up to Italian standards. Hi acidity and no joy. Nobody at the counter speaks Italian. I do not get all the hype. And that is on the heart of the Italian district!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Such a fabulous place for excellent caffe as well as great place to read and talk to neighborhors or interesting tourists . I buy my espresso beans here--have for years. My father introduced me to this great place. There are great monthly small musical presentations. Favoloso. Also impressive 👍 is that there's a wonderful city in north west Italy where the Great espresso originated!!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"The waiter was a bit rough on the edges but helpful overall. The chocolate bread was not crispy and tasted bland. The almond croissant tasted a bit better. The chai latte and coffee were good. I liked the old jukebox, the music and pictures on the wall."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"An iconic San Francisco cultural landmark. I reccomend anyone visiting the city who wants to experience the timeless feeling of San Francisco cafe culture to pop in for a cappuccino and a pastry. Take your time and have a seat. Write in your journal or read a novel and lose yourself in reverie. My personal history in this place dates back over 40 years to when I was a knee high waif with wild bright red hair, beginning to read the funnies on my own and getting doted on by the smiling sweet Italian lady who owned the place. Recently I have visited once or twice and found the coffee to be delightful and found solace at the sight of regulars reading, writing and conversing with one another. If you find yourself in North Beach or you're showing people around this stop is a must. Here the spirit that existed before the advent of the soulless pyramid at the foot of Columbus still exists. The spirit of intellectual curiosity and discourse that existed in the restaurants of the Montgomery Block which was personified by the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson, Ambrose Bierce, Brett Harte, Samuel Clemens, and Oscar Wilde, to name a few. The sad part is that this cafe has become so unique in the City. There was a time not long ago where every neighborhood had many independent cafes and bookstores feeding the minds of the citizens. But, if you want a taste of what it was like here 20 years or more ago, step in and don't take out."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Dealing with an 8 hour time adjustment following our previous days flight found us out and about exploring the streets of San Francisco at 5.45am. Around 7am and a few miles later we were ready for a coffee and some breakfast and fortunately we stumbled across Caffe Trieste... this was a great find.  Not the most attractive looking from the outside nor a natural draw for tourists however once inside we were very pleased.  Seemingly a place for the locals it was peaceful and full of character and characters!!  Prompt welcoming service, great coffee and food.  If you want simple but great, and away from the tourist traps go here. We would love to go back."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Finally I got the chance to visit this historic cafe. The environment is so nice and friendly. You can tell right away it's frecuented by locals, mostly artists and poets, besides tourists. It really has bohemian and beat vibes all around. Coffee is really good but pastries are amazing. Either you want to have a nice italian breakfast or are following the steps of the Beat Generation in Frisco this tiny spot is a must see. No take out coffee, just grab a table and enjoy.  Edit: I went again. I liked it even more."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"My favorite cafe in San Francisco. It is full of characters - the most creative and odd ""freaks"" of North Beach can be found here.  The espresso is thick, dark and creamy. The furniture and walls ooze with history. I've had many of my most inspired moments here in this cafe and met many beautiful people there.  I've been coming here for about 20 years, and still set aside time for Trieste whenever I'm back in SF."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Went without any prior knowledge of the cafe, it was just what was closest to us on google maps.  We were extremly impressed, the interior is cozy and unique.  The guy behind the counter explained different menu items to us and gave us his recommendations without making us feel rushed.  While he made our drinks he joked around with us and was very friendly.  The lattes were AMAZING, best we had in San Francisco.  Our whole group was very impressed with our experience here."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,a San Francisco mainstay we waited for a very long time in line in order to get our treats and sit outside in the beautiful sunshine the pastries are always good and my cherry Italian soda very very yummy. The cappuccino here was delicious as well we also had some poetry that was being read outside on the corner which was a special treat.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Best coffee we had in San Francisco!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Best coffeehouse in SF or Bay Area.  Don’t miss it.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Great Cappuccino and tasty Tiramisu. Make sure to bring cash, as they dont accept card. There is an ATM machine available there."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The latte I had at this place was incredible! I highly recommend! Enjoy.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Rude service.  Smelled of cigarettes (inside).  Dirty.  Left before tasting the coffee. Plenty of great coffee shops in SF to waste your $ here.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,This is a classic Italian cafe. My brothers father in-law has been coming here since the seventies and introduced me to the place. It's a very cool vibe and occasionally they'll have a band playing classic Italian music. Everything about this place is authentic. It's cash only.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I don’t think the coffee here is good, but this place is worth a visit once because of its history."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Just love this local favourite. Great atmosphere and the best coffee!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Nice cafe with good espresso. Hasb both indoor and outdoor seating.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Where Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for The Godfather!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Many famous writers spent their time here in North beach. The moment I walked inside, I felt totally immersed in into down to earth vibe and nice smell / sound of Italian coffee. You can see a mix of locals and tourists both young and old."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Nice quaint place to have coffee. Nothing fancy about it. It seems Francis Ford Coppolla sat here a couple of times while he wrote Godfather
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Racism shows in all kinds of ways. The two guys at the front couldn't resist, singing ""roly poly"" as code, slamming our drinks around, giving us puny water cups. We've been here once before and it was an excellent experience. This last time tells us not only to not go, but to warn others that they only look skin deep here. When we walked in, they ignored us as long as possible, talking to another gentlemen who didn't even bother ordering coffee. It was dead slow. Not until we approached the counter did they song their code and barely serve us. They barely made eye contact as they gave us the bare minimum interaction, smirking and joking under there breath. It was unprofessional, insulting, and absolutely disgusting.  Look at the other reviews pointing out the racism. They were right."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,great spot for chat...hello fanny/loni/maryanne...jim from galway
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Awesome place! The sweet treats were amazing.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great experience! So old school and not bad in terms of quality. I think it’s not the place to find good food but to feel the vibe of Coppola writing The Godfather
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"If you want more than just a cappuccino or caffe latte at Starbucks, then come visit the 1st Italian coffeehouse west of the Rockies! Been coming here for 50 yrs and I been drinking their fresh brewed lattes or cafe au laits ever since. It's one of the best places to meet poets, writers, musicians,film makers & artists both famous or soon to be, in North Beach!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is local which has very unique atmosphere. Very tasty coffee and delicious pastries. Be careful, crazy Asian service, he can yeall on you for no reason and he can get mad. That is why only 4 stars. I live this place but that guy..."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Iconic Italian cafe. You can't ignore this store's inviting ambiance just because it's located in a nice area.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,This is one of the old-school tried-and-true places in North Beach. It has lasted through out the years with it's family vibe and neighborhood feel. I love the fact that the touristy part of North Beach has never taken it over even with it's prime location.  The coffee here is top notch! And it's cash only.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Loved Café Trieste and I do hope that it does not have to close down (saw a couple of press reports about this possibility). The cappuccino tasted like it does in Rome, the carrot cake was delicious (may be it should be less sweet).  I will definitely be back :)"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"OK quality drinks and snacks, cash only, stressed out baristas.  The place is in a kind of identity crisis. It had been linked to the beat generation and underground art. So they kept the old school, not so tidy decoration, but there isn't any cultural life left in the place!  But anyway, I can tolerate all that for the love of the good old days..."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Amazing! This is a must for tourists. It was great to find a local place that was also tourist friendly with great service and atmosphere. I would definitely recommend a pastry (after the first bite, it will quickly disappear) and remember it’s cash only (100% worth it)."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"One of my wife's favorite coffee houses in the City (and mine). Feels very authentic and local. Opposite of pretentious. People in here are sometimes seen actually reading (don't overreact ) newspapers! (I know, I know, it's very shabby-chic to read printed materials made from dead trees - maybe it's pretentious after all ;) ). Lots of photos of famous visitors from eras long ago hang on the walls. Delicious coffee, wonderful pastries and even an assortment of ales."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The coffee was pretty good. The atmosphere was excellent. This seems like a nice place to visit frequently and hangout if you are staying long term or living in the area. I enjoyed the atmosphere here more than any of the other coffee shops we visited.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"What quirky place, feels like you have stepped back in time and you are drinking coffee with the locals. Check out the live music as well. The coffee was very good, cakes are great but the service can be a little surly - all part of the San Francisco charm in my view..."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Terrible racism cafe. When I walked in the cafe, the woman in the counter looked at me and gathered her brows. I thought it might be her habit(but she didn't even say hello to us.) However, it was not true. when other people came in(they were white people, of course), suddenly she smiled at them and talked so brightly, still ignoring us. We never saw her smile until we went outside after taking the coffee we ordered. When she talked to us, she used the words as little as possible. Needless to say, she didn't say goodbye to us, too. I knew her attitude like that only went to us. After I step out of there, I felt terrible at my hand grabbing the cup of coffee she made. That was the worst coffee in the world."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is an Italian American cafe; complete with Italian American baristas and customers.  If you do not like Italian Americans, real coffee, and pastries, perhaps this is not for you.  But... If you like all people, and can respect the cultures and subcultures reflected within the glorious city of San Francisco; then this cafe becomes so much more than just coffee.  It can transport you back to a time and a place, one that many of us have forgotten and one that even more have never experienced.  This has become my personal favorite cafe; my guide with which I judge all others.  Thank you to the baristas, the customers, the family, and thank you to Pappa Gianni."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"It happened to be a Saturday music night, just a few wonderful musicians played pieces for guitar and accordion and guitar and trumpet. It wasn't crowded, the deserts were very good and so was coffee. Loved the ambiance."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Cash only spot with an ATM inside. Cute spot right in the heart of North Beach for a coffee and a chat. Ordered a mocha, but probably should have said Cafe Mocha because what I got instead was a hot chocolate type drink in a burning hot glass. Next time I will sit outside and sip wine. My chocolate cookie (I was told the Italian name but didn't catch it): it was just so-so honestly. However, this place has character and personality. I'll stop by if I'm in the area for a glass of wine in the sun. Lots of other pastries and delicious looking cakes make this worth a second look."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"An original classic. Coffee and espresso are great. Cakes, cookies and wine! Durring the pandemic everything is seating on the sidewalk! It's the same great neighborhood just outside."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Barista seemed to not want to be there.  Americana was mediocre. Hot cocoa was good.  HITW Coffee nearby is much better if you're not looking for espresso.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Old school Italian coffee at its best. Come here for the ambiance; Don’t expect lavish service.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Best espresso, cold chocolate and sooo nice  people. Also very confortable to sit!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Classic SF café. I first went here in the late 1970s when espresso and cappuccino were exotic specialties, not like now when they are household words thanks to Starbucks et al. This was a favorite hangout for beat generation poets and artists. They used to have live opera every Sunday. Gone downhill a little but the coffee and vibe is still great and no other café has so much history or evokes so many memories."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Caffe Trieste is THE greatest coffee in the entire Bay Area. Full bodied, rich, bursting with flavor. Trieste puts all the trendy coffee companies to shame, absolutely no comparison when it comes to excellent flavor. Be sure to stop at the Retail Annex to buy whole beans for home. My favorite is the Dark French Supreme, half dark roast French and half medium roast Italian. Make at home with a French press and you will attain COFFEE NIRVANA on the pinnacle of coffee bliss."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Cash only. Good selection of pastries and treats. They also offer pizza and sandwiches. A good place for locals top meet up, sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine. Staff is a little aloof, but they get the job done. You have to grab your own pastries off the plate, which is weird."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"4$ for coffee and 3$ to the ATM machine, no card excepted, desperate Italians can not stand American coffee and still believe that Triestle will give them the taste like back home. Guys don’t know how to maintain their coffee machine properly so the coffee comes out bitter and not tasty."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Any place that is cash only gets off to a bad start (-1). I had to go use their sketchy ATM (-1). Anyways. I ordered a cappuccino and the barista simply scooped the milk and foam into my cup (-1). I was shocked at how blatantly he failed to make the slightest effort. The milk tasted burned (-1). It had that distinct smell to it. On a bright side, there were a few people playing live instruments which was very uplifting and I enjoyed that very much. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Respect to my fratellino caffe trieste, best espresso i ever had in the us. The eclair was a bit of an americanat very big. Meluzzo still enjoyed it."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"One of the employees (owner?) was making borderline racist remarks. We walked in, was checking out the menu, then he said ""line up along the counter, don't block the entrance"". Which was totally fine until then but he went on ""American dollars only, backed by American military strength."" Not sure if my Asian appearance prompted him to say that, but what the actual f"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great coffee shop. I love that everyone know each other
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Caffè Trieste was a favorite haunt of my guy's when he lived not far from North Beach in the late '60s, and he tries to visit it whenever he's in SF.  My first visit was just shy of five years ago, when we came just for coffee and the ambience.  The coffee is great and I was given reason to expect equally good quiche.  Unfortunately there was no quiche when we arrived, so I ""settled"" for the delicious-looking cheesecake in the pastry case.  I'm very happy to say that I couldn't have made a better choice!  My guy had an apricot turnover, which he said was excellent.  The cappucino was predictably excellent.  We had more time this visit, so I was able to take in the history reflected in the photos and other memorabilia displayed (there's a lovely tribute to the founder, Giovanni ""Papa Gianni"" Giotta, who died a year-and-a-half ago at age 96).  In addition, we were joined at our communal table by a party of four, an American, a Swiss expat, and a Swiss/Italian couple, who were great company -- no smartphones at our table, just great conversation.  Our visit was lovely but I would be remiss not to mention that finding parking is extremely challenging (be prepared to walk, uphill and down) and Trieste is cash-only (so plan ahead)."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Best coffee in San Francisco! Amazing interior and prices (except wine)
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,What can I say? It's the real deal with a mural of an Italian fishing village. Look for the nude toddler holding onto mommy's hand. Some of the patrons are really full of themselves. Baristas get cynical swiftly. All I ever order is cappuccino grande and an occasional biscotti. Only went to the Saturday concert once. I've been a patron since 1965 when they had a bottomless cup. The heart of San Francisco.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Good espresso. Polite staff, they also take credit cards now. I used to go to Cafe Greco when i was in the area but think i will switch over to here for a couple more times."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"The history and energy is literally dripping from the walls. The art work, the furniture, the coffee and pastries, sensational!!!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,This is THE place for coffee in San Francisco. It is literally a legendary place. It is inhabited by the by the spirits of the past and brightened by the promise of a post-Covid future.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Popped by on a Saturday afternoon, had a lovely and very cheap ($3.30!) proper pot of tea, and enjoyed some great live music of the old school (guitar and accordion). A super little spot."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This popular coffee shop serves Café Latte that reminds me of Blue Bottle coffee with a strong, bitter taste, yet completely smooth. It has an interesting wall mural with a shop next door to purchase fresh whole or ground beans. It has the feel of a family-run neighborhood coffee shop."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Fun and cheerful guys serving up the coffee. Nice Italian opera playing on the jukebox. And they took good care of my backpack after I left it on the back of my chair and only remembered it hours later.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This place is a gem. I met a real life poet here! I bought his poem book and everything. The atmosphere AND the espresso are to die for. If you came to San Francisco and missed this place, I feel sorry for you."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Iconic, real Italian business, they do not accept card payments, but have ATM inside so they can rather cash on you, than lose on credit card fees! Good coffee, place with the right spirit!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Above average latte. Also tried butter croissant, almond croissant, tiramisu and cinnamon something.  All of those were really bad qualities.  Seems like they don't care for business anymore."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great coffee! It's obviously a local destination.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Just the right about of grime makes this popular local haunt one of my fave places in North Beach. Sit outside in the sun with a glass of wine or coffee or snack on pastries while you delve into a newspaper or clack away on your laptop in the surprisingly large interior. Family style seating and small tables mean the old men nearby might drop into your conversation and regale you with tales from their youth or back when the neighborhood at least was younger. I would hang out here every day if I lived closer. Cash only but there is an ATM on premises.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Good atmosphere a bit on the dirty side
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Didn't buy the coffee. Waited in line while checking out the menu. An old lady cut me off. Cashier asked me if I was with her. I realized what just happened and said NO. Was going to let the old lady place her order. She passed racist rude comment. Didn't say another word and left. End of story.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Best coffee I have ever had. The cream that they use is amazing. I wish I could go there everyday!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Really good coffee! The ambiance is awesome throughout the week. The time I went they had a wonderful guitar player. 🤙🏻 …
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great cup of coffee and a cannoli to end the day.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great coffee shop! They have the best cappuccinos!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Absolutely THE B E S T coffee and people in T H E CITY...Ahhhh ....if only the walls could talk. As I sit across the street now at THE SALOON,as I have been for over 50 years,watching the masses parade by, now so self involved in their electronic leash world ,completely lacking in ALL social interaction, it’s nice to still see that little bit of the city 🌃 I grew up in ,THE TRIESTE, exist. Carry on friends ,wave laugh and smile....😁🤪🥰🥳☘️"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"First. I've never written a food/coffee/restaurant review in my entire life, but this one got me. I'll begin by saying it is the best coffee I've had in SF, and I enjoy the old school vibe of the place. However, when I asked for extra cream in my coffee, I apologized for being a ""Pain in the ass"". As I fumbled through looking for four quarters to leave a dollar tip. The blonde barista said ""You're cheap too"". First off, no one owes any tip as a requisite condition for reasonable customer service. Second, a $1 tip on $5 coffee is fine.  I have a really tolerant personality for this kind of thing as I understand that some people have bad days, and that's fine - But in any industry this is very close, if not a fireable offense. If she has several of these complaints, the cafe should fire her ass. That kind of service is comically bad.  I love the coffee, but i'm done giving them business."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Don’t bother coming here  Cash only  They make everyone show ID & vaccine certificate (just for coffee). Woman was shouting at a man sat by himself in a corner to put his mask on. Awful service. Walked out because of the stress
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Terrible experience overall. Overpriced everything and music so loud you can't even talk. Homeless yelling at people on patio but staff do nothing, then the unfriendly staff make you feel rushed to leave. Not recommended. Won't be back."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Gets 5 stars only because of its historical value. This is the heart of many movement's such as the Beats, Hippies, Art, Poet's, etc. But if a tourist came in here once, I don't think they'd ""get"" it, but who knows? I've been coming in here so long that maybe I'm part of the landscape, but maybe not because I don't think that the regulars consider me a regular partly because I live in Sausalito and only can come in 3 to 5 times a month.  I really like to come here because of the people I know and the people that I meet. If I lived closer I'd probably make it a daily habit.  Usually a line here but the baristas are super quick with wonderful pastries, descent coffee and sandwiches.  It probably took me coming here for 4 or more years for regulars to classify me as an artist but that was something I never tried to be. It's enough in this world to try to be yourself as its very easy for a person to be inauthentic because all of us are influenced mightily by what the world expects us to be. It's a hard trap to get out of because we are all so influenced by what we perceive others to expect of us. This Trap is so mind bendedly that we hardly even see it. It takes courage and years to escape from what we perceive is expected of us in society. At least that's how I currently see it and maybe I'm wrng so check it out for yourself."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I love the pictures on the wall, it really brings the place together. The music is also amazing."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Stopped here for coffee while enjoying the sights of San Francisco. Enjoyed a performance with traditional Italian music (accordian, ""O Solo Mio"" etc.) Was unpleasantly surprised to find out that during the concert coffee drinks literally double in price. Paid $15 for two cappuccinos but I suppose thems the breaks. Kept a positive attitude and enjoyed the coffee. Was a little irritated by other patrons cheerfully seating themselves at my table but the place was packed so we just rolled with it. It's okay. Been to much cozier spots but the place has lots of history."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"[COCKROACH ALERT] I went because of a friend's recommendation but felt not just underwhelmed but profoundly disappointed. The people working there were weird and rude. The wifi system definitely needs an upgrade, and so does the sanitary situation. We saw a COCKROACH crawling on the wall right next to us. Just take a look at the photos attached. How adorable!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great coffee quaint joint rich with history
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Caffe Trieste is what you'd get if you drunkenly tried to explain Starbucks to a suave Italian gentleman.  He then goes, gets a shop, and starts making delicious Italian style coffee drinks, simple sandwiches, in a bar-style place that occasionally has live music. He opens a few more locations and suddenly you can get this same, wonderful experience in various places around the city. And you're so happy, even if you're a bit hungover.  This location is cash-only.  Try the chai latte."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,I love this place glad it survived pandemic.  I highly recommend it.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,It's fine? There are definitely better coffee options in SF but if you're in the area it will do. Pastries looked really good.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"The shop had an aura of authenticity and warmth that could make any passerby truly feel at home. The staff was kind and generous, and the coffee was fantastic! I look forward to returning one day 🤞 …"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Really great coffee. Singer/guitarist busking good music out front. Inside and outside seating.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This place is awesome! Can't recommend it enough. Good coffee, great pastries, awesome atmosphere. The people you'll meet and talk to here are one of a kind"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Place was busy and crowded, which is not a complaint, however the staff seemed cranky to me. I went because it's a historically relevant café, but I wouldn't particularly reccomend it for any other reason.  Nice atmosphere, aside from what seemed to me like a negative attitude."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,THE gathering place for beat poets when I was a lad. They're a little grayer. The coffee goes down like a slalom racer. Eavesdropping on conversations is a  grad course. We all wish Giovanni “Papa Gianni” Giotta a pleasant voyage among the stars. He was good to us.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Great cannoli but the guy that took my order was extremely rude! I found that weird because most reviews comment on how friendly they are.  The guy acted like I was bothering him before I said hello.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Lovely Café with great coffee and cakes.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Very nice and well presented espresso drinks. Great vibe. Best espresso in North Beach.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is an old classic,  a coffeehouse thats been going since the Bohemian era. They get an eclectic mix of customers. Oh and they also make fine espresso drinks! They sure know how to make foam!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Great atmosphere: this cafe is comfortable for regulars and newcomers alike. They have especially great latte, espresso, and biscotti. Great for working, relaxing, or a quick bite."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,One of my favorite coffee shops in all of San Francisco! So much history associated with the place. A wonderful San Francisco landmark!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,LOVE the coffee and pastries here. Excellent eclair and Cafe Mocha.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Delicious espresso drinks and pastries. Try the almond croissants. Local lore says Francis Ford Coppola kept a typewriter there and would sit drink espresso while he wrote the original screenplay for The Godfather.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Classic San Francisco coffee shop.  Funky cafe in an iconic Italian Neighborhood.  Not the best coffee you have ever had but better than any national chain.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Went there yesterday July 20th 2019 with my girlfriend. Ordered 2 Americano 2 dine in.  My girlfriend changed her mind and want to get it to go. One of the two guys became upset and told us it was too late  He already poured it in the glass.   I did ask them if he was to pour it in a cup will affect the taste.  He said no  It just means they have to wash those 2 glasses. I ask what about the customer he said it depends on who the customer is. my girlfriend became very upset refused to pay and left. They said in a rude way who's next. I realize those 2 guys were very racist they were very unprofessional and they were very rude. I told  them that a little etiquette goes a long way. I was hoping for a apology or excuse  Like Hey man it's been a busy day sorry for being impolite that would have did it for me. Instead they became more rude and hateful.   After that we swore at each other in front of the other customers I left in anger. I will never go back to that racist environment and I will tell others about it.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is a fantastic place, the food and service was amazing. The corned beef hash and the hangover special are must haves. We walked and missed the parking issue and late morning only waited 5 minutes."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Classic SF Italian Coffee shop that has been open since the 1950's.  Among the best coffee in the city!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,I first started going to Caffee Trieste in 1979 when I ived in the Mission District and later the Tenderloin. Caffee Trieste was a haven of interesting people and culture.  Since then I've been back every few years and little has changed.  Still the best coffee and coffee drinks and some of the best people watching around.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Today, the Dude with beard behind counter was talking to his guy friend while 6 people are waiting in line... Then when I confronted him about why the lines not moving he said ""You're going to be disrespectful to me? Then I can be disrespectful to you!"" Which I replied ""Your the one being disrespectful to all of us, by talking to your friend while you should be working"". Place needs new workers they seem so relaxed and lazy, well to be honest, just the one talking to his significant other obviously."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Historic certainly, but nice...maybe. The old barista was a sullen and brusk, though the young one was ok. I asked for a cafe mocha with little or no foam. I got nothing but foam. I have to assume he was disgusted with a presumed tourist, or maybe with the fact that I asked for something specific that I was paying for, either way F off customer. Meh. Also: EXPENSIVE as all get out. Meh. Meh I say."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Pretty iconic cafe in Little Italy. Nice tasting espresso. I picked up a $10 mug for coffee at home.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I was born in the caffe Trieste. I live there too. Well, actually I met my husband there and have spent hundreds of hours inside of it's charming edifice. It's a place to live, to be born and inspired. While it's all delicious, the tea, the antipasti, the drinks, you come here to write in your notebook, so, do it. Join Francis Coppola, Eartha Kitt, and the now defamed Bill Cosby and write a masterwork, then join the poet's table and read it to someone. You may see poet laureate Jack hirschmann there too. I come there now with my daughter and pass a couple of hours in timeless happiness doing very little."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Cool place no doubt but they sell a coffee for 4 bucks and don’t even bother accepting cards. (I will leave it to your imagination why). Nice place tho, good coffee."
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Honestly 1 star for coffee taste. Reminded me of expired Starbucks.

Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The best coffee in the entire San Francisco and the service and decor that will make you feel as if you really were in Italy. Definitely in the top five destinations in town!
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Very authentic place to have a coffee listen to some folksy music and sit amongst the San Fran modern literati (?).  Enjoyed my coffee and the atmosphere during my quick visit to this special neighborhood.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,Gets very hot here on a hot day. Little dark inside. Cold coffee was fine. Little bitter but OK if you are looking for the caffeine kick. Not a great crowd too.

Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,The vibe seems very 'local'. The coffee is good and on a strong side. I wish they accepted cards but on the other hand there's something about paying with cash that adds to the vibe.
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"This is one of the old beatnik bar/ coffee houses in North Beach. Spent several hours hete tonight where I met smart, involved individuals and had wonderful conversations with them. Enjoyed myself immensely."

Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"I've been coming here for years ever since I move from Sunset to Nob Hill. With a rich family history no matter which end of Broadway tunnel I drive out, it's either Chinatown to your right or Little Italy on your left, or vice versa. Anyway, I'm known as Albie to some and Bambino to others. Here they called me bambino because of my smooth flamboyant babyish face. The people here are always nice to me and make my beverage before even stepping in as my drink is always the same unless indicated. CT is a old school SF cafe that specializes in Italian roast, and its roasted themselves. Next door is a souvenir merchandise shop that sells everything coffee bean related. Ora andare a bere un caffè!"
Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Really oldschool caffee shop. It is famis because the God fathers movie's script was written here. The staff was not very kind but place is really unique.

Caffe Trieste,601 Vallejo St.,"Food was fine, but not worth the 20 minutes we waited in line to order"
