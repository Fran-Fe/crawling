Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,We got Vanilla paste lattes which tasted good. We also got their pastries and avocado toast. They just tasted okay mainly because they were not warmed up in spite of asking. The service was not really good - the guy at the counter was very rude. Atmosphere of the cafe itself is unique and nice. Wish the service was better.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Lovely baristas, great environment to work at but no wifi i think. Has two floors, plenty of seating options. Great coffee! I had the everything croissant with cheese filling. Lovely. Definitely will go back."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Good coffee, but the waiter at the register was not helpful at all. My coffee was cold last time, I asked it hotter. She was arrogant and told me that's how they do it as the water kettle can only boil the water to certain temperature (really!) without even considering a barista could have made a mistake, like using little older water. Anyways, coffee is good and different coffee options are available as pour over."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Immaculate vibes, great coffee. Whole place has a minimalistic rustic farmhouse feel. Coffee is freshly brewed all the time and taste great.  Good place for working/homework/chilling. But they don’t have Wi-Fi so be prepared to use your own hotspot if you need it."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"3.5 stars. super cute industrial vibe, great for studying, and would come here to get some work done. personally the coffee was too sour/strong for me but my mom loved it. it was also pretty pricey and they don’t warm up pastries (mini chocolate croissant was disappointing) very clean bathrooms!"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,The coffee is okay and the pastries are from neighbor bakehouse. Don’t think they bake anything in-house. Avo toasts aren’t available Monday-Thursday.  Def come here for the vibe more than anything else! Wish they had wifi though.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"My favorite location in the city. This is where they roast their beans. The inside is huge, plenty of seating downstairs and upstairs.  We were pleasantly greeted with a display case overflowing with pastries. Pastries are from Neighbor Bakehouse and another bakery (not listed).  We enjoyed perfectly made flat white and latte.  Plus they were one of the only cafes opened at 7am."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Sightglass Coffee is truly a coffee lover's paradise. I visited this place with high expectations, and it did not disappoint. I ordered a latte, and the barista who made it was truly amazing. He was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about coffee. I could tell that he was passionate about what he does, and it showed in the quality of his work.  The latte itself was fantastic. The coffee was rich, smooth, and had a delicious nutty flavor that was perfectly balanced by the creamy milk. But what really made it stand out was the latte art. The barista made a special design, and it was truly a work of art. The attention to detail was incredible, and it was clear that he put a lot of care and thought into his craft.  The atmosphere of the cafe was also fantastic. It was cozy, comfortable, and had a great vibe that made me feel right at home. The interior was beautifully designed, with lots of natural light and warm wood accents that gave it a rustic feel. The seating was comfortable, and there was plenty of space to relax and enjoy your coffee.  Overall, I would highly recommend Sightglass Coffee to anyone who loves coffee. The baristas are friendly and talented, the coffee is top-notch, and the atmosphere is unbeatable. It's the perfect place to relax and unwind, and I can't wait to go back again soon."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Open Café which is incorporated in their own coffee roastery. You can sit and enjoy your coffee on the upper floor while looking at the cafe and the working roastery. The architecture is very open in inviting. Found this place by chance, worth the stop! You can also get cookies and little pastries besides your coffee. Coffee is on the pricy side though even for San Francisco."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Great coffee with a nice seating area. Enjoyed the Vanilla Paste Latte and the latte art was on point with my latte. We also got the Masala Chai but felt it was a bit muted and without a really strong flavor.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Amazing. The building is gorgeous. Very unique coffee shop. Awesome seeing the live coffee roasting take place.  I ordered a cappuccino and I enjoyed. Very rich coffee flavor. Didn’t taste like pure milk as other coffee shops tend to make. 👍🏽
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Excellent service…very kind and patient staff…and wonder espresso. Was told by many espresso enthusiasts that they’re great. I’m in complete agreement!
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Super disappointed with the service at Sightglass. I asked about the Vanilla Paste Latte and the guy with the “merp” attitude said “it’s just vanilla.” So I’m being fooled into paying 75 cents extra for vanilla syrup I suppose? The spot was also out of matcha which was unfortunate. I tried the “Vanilla Paste” latte from my hubby and it was excessively sweet. Pass for me.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,This coffee shop is stylish and spacious and that’s what makes it go to spot for me. Love it because it never gets crowded so you always can find a quiet spot for work or couple of seats to chat with a friend. The coffee choice is great and you can buy ground coffee there as well. Their bakery is pretty good too. Highly recommend to check this place if you are near SOMA!
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Spacious and calming spot for coffee with beautiful sunlight exposure. Sat down for a morning coffee and bite while also doing some light work. The vibes here are top notch. Also, the curry potato puff is a must-try. Honestly, a strong recommend for cafe lovers."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"No outlets, no wifi, no air-conditioning. The exposed wood loft ceiling is cool looking, but if you're gonna have seating up there you'd probably want to have some A/C going on a warm day. The stars are for the good coffee and the friendly service --  (especially the person who helped me clean some grime from the subway off my bag)."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,I was here for a couple of hours on a Friday  morning. The pour over is fantastic I heard. And there's huge fan base for their coffee beans. Service was great! I got Ethiopia for my husband and he loves it! I ordered a mocha(not the best I've had) with a bite and worked out of this place. Loved the vibe. Ample space to sit and work. Will definitely visit again and not order mocha next time! :P
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Slow and average. Two baristas working very inefficiently. It was not busy and I waited 10 mins for my cortado which I’d give a 3/10 - milk was over steamed (too hot and dry) and poured poorly. Barista seemed to be very inexperienced. Only redeeming quality was the nice cashiers at the front. I thought Sightglass was one of the better coffee co’s in the bay but it seems they’ve slipped.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,This place is a great surprise. Great espresso and a great selection of pastries.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"The place is amazingly beautiful, but the coffee is SO bad. My dripped coffee looked like tea and tasted terrible. That's a shame for a place whose main business is to sell coffee. Everything else tho is perfect"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Best Latte in the city🫶 You can enjoy the whole cafe view from upper level and park your bicycle on the bicycle rack!🚲
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Loved the layout of the coffee shop. The music is slightly loud when you’re sitting by the second floor, but I generally love high ceilings so it was worth the trade. The morning bun was good, and I appreciated that there were so many open seats even on a Saturday afternoon."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"I’ve lived in SF, tried all the coffee shops, but this physical location to get coffee is superior in my opinion. The black coffee (for those who are into 3rd wave style) is phenomenal on drip, but the single origin espresso is pulled so well. Solid shots. A couple things to make note: huge pastry selection from local bakeries, and also they are dog friendly. Two dogs on leash with their owners, as a dog person I appreciate that. My favorite aspect is the design of their space. The Sightglass team really maximized a beautiful space and the natural lighting, the upstairs, and the classic coffee playlist is ideal for a productive workday/study day. Overall best coffee shop in SF if you’re into real coffee. If you get in earlier in the weekdays, you can smell and watch the coffee being roasted by their roaster. Cheers mate."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Sightglass Coffee is one of the first cafes I visited after moving to SF several years ago. To this day, it's still one of my favorite places to get coffee, or lattes, to be exact. Their pastries are quite good and they do offer a wide selection, from sweet to savory options (e.g., croissants, scones, pastelitos, empanadas,...).  If you are thinking of ordering some pastries and need a recommendation, I would go for any one of their croissants which are outsourced from Neighbor Bakehouse, a well-known bakery in the city. Just looking at them, you can tell they will be good. I personally think you could skip out on the gluten-free donuts, which are decent but not particularly noteworthy in comparison to some of the other GF donuts I have had before. I have tried the strawberry lemon donut which is apparently one of there more popular flavors, which tastes lightly of strawberry, and chocolate espresso donut, which tastes of chocolate.  This particular location, in SOMA, is unique because they have a gas coffee roaster which they use to roast their coffee beans throughout the day. It's also probably one of the more spacious cafes in the city, with two stories available to the public.  Note: The first floor of Sightglass is typically cool and shaded and has a number of seats surrounding the roaster. If you are interested in taking a look at the coffee roasting process, I would definitely recommend grabbing a seat there. The second floor also has a number of seats, as well as a private space for Sightglass employees. On sunnier days, this floor does get pretty hot. I felt using ""warm"" would be an understatement. Also, there is no wifi at this location. However, do not let that stop you from enjoying yourself. Bring a book or a friend.  I would definitely recommend checking Sightglass Coffee out sometime or another."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Bright large space to enjoy your coffee at, with a lower and upper level to sit at! I enjoy their espresso drinks and have gotten affogato here in the past. They also have pastries. It's mostly metered street parking nearby. Would recommend stopping by if you're in need of some caffeine."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Plenty of seating, really friendly staff, and great coffee! Super glad I tried this place"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"good coffee n pastries, nice atmosphere/good seating, but no WiFi."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Coffee was great and the shop had a very cool vibe.  Felt like we were inconveniencing the employees by ordering.  Not a friendly vibe and wouldn’t return. Bummed as this was a recommendation.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,The ambience is above and beyond. Having the roaster inside the store elevates the coffee experience. The coffee itself I would rate (6/10) it was not prepared properly.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,I really loved the space but it was so warm I started to sweat within moments.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Latte is my favorite drink. Every where I go I order a latte I’ve been many many places, and I never experienced this taste of latte. And the way I order is super simple plain and regular milk.Love the latte!! Best ever try !! Customer service nice!! Okay area around."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"If you want to have a special coffee, this place would be the best choice. :) I’ve tried  cortado, 1 shot of espresso with a equal amount of steamed milk, it was very nice!"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Dog loves it here.  Don't order the cortado, they gave me a latte instead when I ordered one. 🤯"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Great place to work and study. The second floor is huge! Came here to network with someone I met through LinkedIn and we were able to hear each other talk. I recommend the ube cookie and matcha latte.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"love this coffee shop - beautiful natural light, tasty coffees to choose from, and knowledgable kind baristas make this a stop anytime i’m in sf. ordered a pour over of the honduras and enjoyed the atmosphere. thanks for the hospitality!"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Served a delicious, jammy Mexican coffee. Baked goods were on point and space is dope."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Awesome shop. Great care is taken in preparing drinks. My cappuccino was masterfully crafted, albeit I personally don't love the taste of their espresso. It seemed like a darker roast than is necessary, though it full well could have been a bad shot. C'est la vie, c'est le café."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,High end coffee roasters with beautifully developed great sourced beans. If you want to see the whole process from roasting to packing to the espresso bar of the hand brew you can definitely see it here. Come take a look and enjoy your experience :-)
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Great,  great coffee spot in downtown San Francisco.  Staff was great,  coffee was excellent, with a large inside area. A tad over-priced but definitely delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"We had tea and cappuccino, and they were great. My main issue is that there is no wi-fi or plugs, so how is it supposed to be a workspace? The only explanation is that it limits the users to the limit of their batteries, then they need to go to another coffee shop or something."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Ambience and vibe 5 🌟 The ambience is perfect for reading or for work! I really hoped the mocha would've tasted better 😪
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Nice space, very light and airy with the skylights and upstairs sitting area. I felt the staff is a little blase and short, but maybe that's part of the boheme cafe thing ;) Coffee quality was great, for the naturally steep SF price which is fine"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Sight glass proudly display their coffee roasters which have a industrial beauty to them and if you know how to appreciate excellent coffee and how it’s made then come here. So sit and enjoy the magic.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"One of the best 'coffee and work' joints in San Francisco! Amazing selection of coffee, great open space to work & collab. The staff is very welcoming and cool! An inclusive space despite the neighborhood they are in. Sightglass now has AvoToasty acai bowls and avocado toast on Fridays and Saturdays"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Prefect latte. My latte had the right temperature, and tasted fresh. My first time getting coffee here. I was impressed by the vast space available to sit and they had the coffee roasting in the process. I understand the line was long, but as a first timer, the lady could have told me more about the location.  There is another coffee shop Sextant, and they are nothing compared to Sightglass. Don’t get mixed up of where to go just because these locations aren’t far away from each other."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"You will get a delicious coffee without fail at Sightglass. I try shops all over San Francisco, and while the competition is tight, Sightglass holds the lead for consistency and a great venue.  I roast my own coffee, so it's always fun to watch the roaster do their work while appreciating some of their output!"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Very nice espresso bar! I'm a nerd about coffee, and they blow my nerdiness out of the water. Every grind is weighed. Every pour is weighed!! Upstairs there's 2 other separate espresso machines, smaller than the main. Leads me to believe their morning rush is insane. I came around 4 pm and it was mellow. Usual is a plain double shot. The body was rich and flavor nice. I wish I had a bag to take home a bag of beans. It was cool to see a side wall bike rack, that's SF for you. Everyone bikes lol! So happy to stumble upon this coffee haven."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"An ode to the beans. This place roasts, serves, and sells some of the best coffee around. They have a a great open space, 2 levels where you can enjoy or even work a bit. They have a cool industrial aesthetic going on."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"5 - Coffee..light and perfect 3 - no charging ports 3 - Gets hot in summer no AC 5 - Atmosphere is good 5 - Music is perfect, not loud (not audible) 5 - Plenty of seating...i prefer upstairs 5 - Desk height- perfect for arms reach to work on laptop or read book 3 - Noisy but it cancels out so you can still have good conversations  Waiting for winter or a foggy day to visit again"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Sight glass is located on 7th Street and Folsom St. In my opinion, Sightglass coffee  is the best roastery in the SOMA area. The Muni bus lines12, 27, and 8 stop a block away. The Sightglass roasterie has drip coffee and premade coffee. The coffee is definitely top in SF and if you also like to people watch while drinking coffee then the split level balcony is ideal. I really like the interior design of wood, soft lighting, and granite. The building interior is original and the big beam roof rafters are a beautiful feature. This Cafe is a must visit if you are in SF as a tourist."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Excellent coffee! We ordered a cappuccino and vanilla latte. Both were amazing! Well balanced flavors!  Coffee is roasted and ground freshly in house. You can even watch the process of roasting in the cafeteria.  The decor of the store is impeccable and the environment is excellent!
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,There's always a line but it moves pretty quickly. The pastries are so good! I've been enjoying there coffee!😉..☕freshly roasted and brewed 🥐 Mushrooms & cheese yummy goodness! If you're in the area you should check it out. …
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Really enjoyed the vibe of the place as well as the matcha lattes I ordered plus a pastry. Prices are a bit steep, I paid $15 for the two items. To be fair the matcha latte and pastry were delicious. I was hoping to sit down and get work done on my computer here... Despite being a two story coffee shop they did not have any charging outlets and they do not have wifi. So my studying was short-lived."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"The carrot cake donut is delicious! I also had the masala chat latte, which is well balanced. The space is spacious and ideal for working remotely."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Great industrial space, vertigo smell of roasting, and great espresso - not too hot, nor too bitter. The raspberry hazelnut croissant tastes every bit as good it looks.  The lack of WiFi is somewhat inconvenient, but the lack of power outlets more so - you need to be organised if you want to do some work here.  Pleasantly quiet at 830am on the Sunday of the #pride march, but got busy quickly."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"I love this place and always try to hit it up when I'm in SF. The new thing is on Fri -Sun they have an avocado toast pop-up and that's what is in the picture, along with a cup of Summer Solstice pour over."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"I went here because I heard about the hype- one of the best in San Francisco. I was not let down. The smell of coffee wafted through the industrial chic building. I could ask questions without looking stupid, and I could get great coffee. I wish I could stay longer or go back, worth a stop if you’re in the area."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,My cappuccino was great as well as my hub’s vanilla latte. Really liked interior designed like industrial and loft vibe with cool stereo system. Pastry was great as well. Awesome service
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"High quality, lots of space and friendly, knowledgeable baristas. On Fridays they have a free public cupping to showcase their coffee. They are great about answering questions and helping pick out what you might want."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Fancy looking cafeteria with impressive roasting equipment running in the entrance. However, nonchalance and ignorance maximal followed when I asked if I could have my macchiato in a normal ceramic cup instead of paper cup. Understandably, it won't be much more pretty than this when you just pour it over from one to the other and then smack it down the table so that the foamed milk runs over the edge 😂. I had to ask the guy in the register if this is how they normally serve macchiato and tall guy said yes! So now you know, take a look at the photos."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Super cool interior/ well preserved warehouse to work, drink coffee, converse in…. However 10-15 min wait when it’s busy to get a latte is a bit rough. Top notch product despite being sourced directly from the epicenter of the sf hipster barista movement."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Had heard a lot about this place before visiting. Coffee was very average and got a takeout cup when I was dining in. Pain Chocolat was also not that good, with the location and ambience they can definitely do much better than this"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"My girlfriend and I both loved our coffee. However, the music they were playing.. Sandstorm-esque trance music, Deadmau5.. at 8:30 on a Sunday morning. C'mon."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Great coffee and pastries. No outlets nor wifi at this location. Staff is not super friendly for a nice looking place like this.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Good coffee. Quick service. Nice vibes. There's no wifi, so it's not the best place to study unless you have a hotspot."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"I messed up an online order this morning and ordered from the Potrero Hill neighborhood location of Sightglass by accident instead of this location. When I showed up asking for my online order, the very kind barista here at the SOMA location tried to find my order and when he realized my mistake, he immediately offered to make my same order free of charge. It was extremely comforting because I was running late, stressed, and needed my coffee and he could have easily not helped me because it was totally my fault for the error. Very grateful."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"I'm usually not left feeling with a good impression of coffee storefronts. But this store blew all my expectations. The coffee is fantastic. I was beginning to think good quality coffee wasn't a thing anymore in San Francisco. The pastry selection is fantastic. The staff obviously love their job and my personal favorite about the business is the building itself. I came here on a coffee outing with my boyfriend, but this is a space that can also be used for groups, meetings or if you want a relaxing, safe and comfortable environment to sip your coffee in. I will absolutely be returning and will be recommending this to everyone I know who can appreciate a good cup of coffee ☕"
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Staff were not very friendly, but the coffee made up for it. Baristas are definitely quite skilled; Honduras V60 pour over was fantastic."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Exotic coffee spot No Wi-Fi no electric outlets just talk to each other.  Their pastries are next level Get ice Vanilla latte with regular milk you will thank me forever
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Sightglass was just a great experience.  Coffee was good and the overall vibe was super chill.  It was my morning stop everyday while visiting San Fran.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Amazing place to sit and unwind. Lots of seating, and the coffee is delicious."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Great place to chill and have coffee, plenty of seats, bright and high ceiling space. There’s a wall of bike racks for those who wanna park their bike at the shop. This place brew coffee from scratch. It’s like a cute little coffee factory! The bakery is also nice. Get the ham and cheese croissant or the seasonal fruit scone. My go to coffee is cafe latte. The staff were a bit unfriendly but if you don’t really care for that then it’s ok."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Delicious coffee with the perfect temperature!
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Very nice and spacious place. It is one of my favorite coffee shops in the neighborhood. Having that said, they don't have WiFi, which is quite unbelievable for 2020. They do have quite a few very nice, large tables. It truly is a great place to get work done, as long as it's offline or you don't mind sharing your mobile data to your laptop.  Would've given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the no-wifi situation."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Excellent espresso-based beverages made with care. Location is kind out of the way. Staff friendly and professional. Prices are a little exxy... but that's SF for you. 🤨 …
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"Got to be one of my favourite coffee spots. Not only is the service good and the ambience nice but the coffee is great. The house blend, Owl's Howl is great."
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,Loved Sightglass.  Waited for an hr to get in. I bought the Winter Soltice (most popular beans per Cafe employee) beans and it was delicious with a caramel hint. I also got the pistachio croissant for about $5 or $6. I got their iced house vanilla latte...which was good and creamy.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,The best coffee shop in San Francisco. I always order their hot latte and it is just PERFECT! I will for sure visit again! Staffs are also very friendly. Thank you for opening and staying with us during the pandemic.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,A fantastic spot to get coffee. Interesting aesthetic and cool people. The coffee quality is top shelf. I subscribe to their coffee subscription and it offers some great beans. I highly suggest trying their seasonal holiday offering - fruity and roasted at the same time.  The folk there are knowledgeable and helped my fiance learn more about coffee and what she would like.
Sightglass Coffee,270 7th St,"I really enjoy the coffee from Sightglass, from a pour over or latte to an iced latte with oat milk. The pastries are delicious and they have open seating upstairs. I am from out of town so I make it a point to stop buy and buy a bag to take home. I first enjoyed their coffee at the Tuesday farmers market at the Ferry Building."
