La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"We wandered around the area after visiting painted ladies.  The place is amazingly decorated and very warm and inviting.  In addition, the amount of people who were there and the line that stretched outside showed that it was probably something good.  We waited patiently for our turn.  Everything looked delicious so we asked one of the employees for recommendations and he did not disappoint.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Sit at the tables outside and take in the atmosphere of the area."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"I really love this place for its delicious and healthy salads, plus they have very testy bakery and good coffee, match with almond milk and hot tea😍  Staff is very helpful and friendly.  There are a lot of places to work with laptop, WiFi, chargers. Definitely one of the best places for meeting people and also for freelancers who want to work in the cafe.  Thank you, guys! 💙💛"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"The Hayes area was my old stomping grounds and wanted to have breakfast before heading home.  La Boulangerie is a hidden gem. They have an extensive breakfast and pastry menu and drinks. I had the chorizo croissant and it was so tasty, delicious and filling. Top it off with a guava tea beverage. Two thumbs up! 👍🏽 👍🏽"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Have you ever wondered what the little cafe ☕️ shop around the corner would look or feel like? Yeah, I know the feeling. Well, look no further. This is your perfect coffee shop and guess what? It’s literally around a corner. It sits on a busy little street here in San Francisco but not so busy that you feel lost in the crowd. You can order your breakfast delicacy or not and then your coffee. And let me tell you, it’s delicious, definitely worth the calories. Come over with a friend and soak in the pleasant scenery with the music 🎼 in the background. You can even come alone, sit outside like I did and take in the beauty of being in a spot where only you and your thoughts matter. It’s a beautiful day and only getting better! #enjoy"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Service is fast (you can get your breakfast in under 5 minutes), employees are friendly and opens early. The baked goods are light but still flavorful. Great for busy mornings."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"I come here often for the baked goods, they're really good, so I thought to come in one morning for their croque madame, but I was a bit disappointed it didn't have any bechamel sauce. Stick with the Kouign-Amann, that's my favorite."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Cool little bakery to stop at for a quick snack. I had the Croque Mansour. It was great
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Their croissants and other pastries are awesome. Therefore, if you want to buy them, I recommend this place. They are the fancy price range, but delicious. Especially, butter croissant is my favorite. However, biscuits are not good. It's expensive compared to that quality. Inside the restaurant is cozy and spacious. You usually can find a seat when you're alone. In addition, if you want to use Wi-Fi here, I don't recommend here because their Wi-Fi is so slow. The shop staff members are okay level. Not rude, but not so helpful to choose products."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Amazing place for coffee and breakfast. Croissants are great, big variety of other options too."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Lovely place, the omelettes are of  good size. The pastries are delicious. I highly recommend the almond croissants warmed. The coffee is also good."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Get the almond croissant. It's worth the three day diet you'll have to endure afterwards, but it's sheer French deliciousness. Lovely service at the counter."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"The person in charge, fat man with glasses, is super rude on multiple separate occasions which infuriated me enough to write this review. First time I needed to quickly use the restroom and the place was still open for another 20 minutes and he refused to let me use it even though I already bought $15 worth of B grade french pastries and coffee at best. No biggie, whatever guy was just being an a-hole. Next time I came to grab a sand-which there and they didn't have it and I didn't really want anything else there. I settled down and was in the middle of working and the guy said I either had to purchase something I didn't want or leave. For all the times a had spent money this seemed like a super cheap, stingy thing to do. If the place was packed I would understand this was just for space management but there were at least 10 other seats in the place. Will never go back here for overpriced food and rude management."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Don’t let the pretentious name fool you; this place sucks. Horrible service. Walked in and for some unexplained reason I was actively ignored and had to specifically call out to place my order. Got a croissant. Wasn’t special. Safeway croissants are cheaper and you don’t have to deal with lousy customer service either. Never going back.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Excellent pastries of course. Very good coffee too, much better than you would get in France! I'll be back, for sure."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,What a charming bakery. What a wonderful selection of pasteries. What a friendly staff. This place is popular and he constant line is a tertimonie to their quality. The menu changes and all things are mot vailable all the time. they have very fresh pre-made salads that are fresh fresh and good good I kept going back for one more pastry and we kept chatting and eating and enjoying each other and the food and we will definitely be back!!!!
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Loved the chocolate croissant and cappuccino I got from here! A perfect snack to grab before walking around and exploring the shops in Hayes. Great place to study/ get some work done as well if you don’t mind a busier environment.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Overpriced coffee and food. They charge an extra $1 for any type of non dairy milk (oat, almond, soy). Very places charge any amount for non dairy milk and when they do it’s never that high. Their coffees is so expensive, if you ask for an ice coffee you get upgraded to a large cup and pay even more for the cup to be filled with ice cubes up to the half. Our coffees were so sweet we complained and they laughed us off. Croque monsieur is $8.50 for a dry toast they just warm up. I’m from Europe and calling themselves by a French name doesn’t grant you the quality automatically."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,This chain is one of the best French bakery in SF in my opinion. The buttery croissants are wonderful. I love the fact you can get some free cornichons too.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Great breakfast Cafe with friendly staff and outdoor seating.. would definitely come back often
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"A nice cafe to chill and have a coffee & nice snack. The service was great and quick. The food was was great, and I got a coconut cold brew."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"I did not go in or have anything to do with their services. I give them 5 stars for location; right in the heart of Hayes Valley and right next to a park. I was right outside the establishment enjoying the Bay to Breakers race on May 15, 2022."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Fun, authentic feeling bakery. I had a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich that was really good. It was a bit small for the price."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Delicious croissants (I tried the hazelnut chocolate croissant) and very good hot drink.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Best breakfast in town. Incredible Croissants, wonderful coffee, very nice service. Great to sit there in the morning. Goods sandwiches during the day as well."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,It would get a 5 if they served the lattes in the beautiful Parisian style bowl mugs like they used to. Pastries are always splendid.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Stopped by this place for a quick snack and was excited to try the croissants. They at first looked very appetizing and high quality, but we soon discovered the disappointment. The croissants tasted old and flavorless. They told us they heated them up and they tasted cold. Bathroom line was longer than the line to buy food... overall very disappointing experience."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Horrible customer experience, walking in and the initial interaction with the behind the counter/sandwich display was getting screamed at without an explanation.  She kept on going on and on about this is not the way to do it and at no point did she care to calm down. This was my second visit, the first was amazing but this worker thought she knew it all and took a defensive stance immediately.  Never coming again."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Love the pastries here especially the almond and chocolate croissant.  I usually get these to go but today I was able to get them warmed and eat in.  Great quality and service!  If you see a line, that normal but it moves fast."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,I've been here a few times before and they have really delicious food but this morning the customer in the back row!!! was able to get her ham and cheese croissant but when I order she said they can't serve a sandwich which is egg and cheese croissant  that is on the menu(all day menu) at the moment I guess they can't make 2 croissant sandwiches at the same time while working and talking on the phone thank you your insulting gesture Thank you also for a great start to the day.  and I suggest you fix your working hours
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Croissants 3. Atmosphere 4. Ruben sandwich 4. Service 3. Value 4. Nice place would return, croissants not the best in town (Hearth?).  Coffee looked OK, but Blue Bottle just down the road :)"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Good place for coffee and breakfast.  Pricey, but then again what isn't pricey in SF.  Friendly staff.  Good amount of people just taking in a good read, catching up on work, or simply enjoying the views while they have a cup of coffee or one of their many pastry options."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Get the pistachio raspberry croissant, and make sure they heat em up! It’s delicious!"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Good coffee, and really good pastries and sandwiches! Lovely vibe. Friendly service too. The drinks came out a little slow but other than that loved this place. Would highly recommend for anyone local or out of town"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Pretty bad customer service. Food and coffee is mediocre at best. Nice seating outside.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Pre covid, this was a great place to eat. The inside colors made you think your were in a French vineyard. Real plates, bowls, cups, and silverware. Under the new owners, it lost its  ambiance.  Now it has all ware in paper and plastic. The inside walls are all white. The food is instant (oatmeal) or microwaved. I will have to find a new place to eat when I'm  in town."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"I love the baguette here. It's crunchy on the outsider, soft in the insider. The sour and buttery favors makes excellent balance."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Good but quite expensive for what it is. When you pay $18 for a sandwich and a drink and don't even feel full at the end, it's because something isn't quite right."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Love that place. Butter croissants are amazing especially with latte.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Very nice bakery. I had croissant with eggs, cheese and tomatoes. It was delicious. Coffee was ok. We had it to go and had a breakfast near Painted Ladies. It was a great choice"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Extremely good. Definitely a more American version of French pastries but executed really well. They also have equator coffee (not sure if they rotate roasters) which is one of the better roasters in the area.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Horrible girl at the cashier : the coffee was scolding hot, and I burned my mouth with it. The girl laughed at me and didn't care at all. Avoid this place (or this girl : she has a problem) Hope the boss will take this comment into account...."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Friendly coffee shop in a central location. Good pastries, good wifi and very laptop friendly. 5 stars in my book!"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"You get your latte in a bowl, that's pretty unique?"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Amazing food, amazing bread, nice large space to sit."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Love this spot. Good service. The pastries are damn good and always seem fresh. Cold brew coffee is solid as well. Liked this place so much that I made a habit of stopping by nearly every weekend when I lived nearby. They have some outdoor seating which makes it a nice place for a weekend café excursion. Recommend to anyone in the area looking for a nice café.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"La Boulangerie is a San Francisco classic. I came on a Saturday afternoon and they had a large selection of breads and pastries, as well as savory items like sandwiches and salads. They mostly feature breakfast pastries, breads, and cookies in the bakery. Their items are creative and well made. They don’t have cakes.  I did notice that since the last time I was in a couple years ago their selection changed. Fewer cold pastries and fewer rustic breads.  This time I tried the quiche which was amazing! Served warm. It was rich, flavorful, and light. I’d highly recommend it."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Great croissants, even the cappuccino was Italian quality!"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"I ordered a matcha latte, the cashier was super friendly and nice, got my drink and only tasted like oat milk, I decide to ask politely for a new one, a girl helped me I don’t know if she was the manager she said she would do it, while she was doing it she was telling her staff behind the counter that I’ve returned the tea and just staring at me. I got the new one just for it to taste like oat milk again, by the way that cup of hot oat milk with a pinch of matcha powder was $7.95. Very disappointed."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"We were staying at the Hayes Valley Inn on Gough (1 block away) and we needed breakfast. The pastries here are rather tasty. The first day I decided to live it up and got an almond covered croissant with almond paste on the inside. So good. I got my son got a chocolate filled pastry.  The second day I picked up a couple of ham & cheese pastries. Both days I asked to have them heated up and the staff obliged. I am disappointed that we don't have a boulangerie near my house, though my belt is not."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Food is good.  I wish they would get their act together and open up a register for people who just want to pick up a few items and leave.  I don't want to stand around and listen to San Francisco's new hoi polloi make coffee orders, sandwich orders, etc.. then wait for them to pull out their wallet or phone, ""oh yeah I have to pay for this."" C'mon.  I want to pick up my purchase and leave so open up a register for ""to-go purchases only."""
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Efficient service, good pastries, great coffee! Next to a lot of little shops on Hayes, good for a nice walk. Had the Cafe au Lait (in a bowl) and a Danish Croissant"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,The pastries are fantastic and the coffees are great. Especially lovely are their blueberry kouign-amann pastries! They're situated in a gorgeous location. My only complaint is their sandwiches are pretty underwhelming and bland.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"No gluten free pastries, so -1 star. Their cold brew doesn’t have ice and warms up quickly, -1. Plus the coffee doesn’t taste as good as the ritual pop-up across the street, which costs the same.  I can’t eat the pastries, so maybe those are good, which they’d have some GF option."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Although food is usually decent, closing staff could learn a lesson in hospitality. Please don’t shout and leer at when someone cannot hear you over water as you tell them you’re closing in a rude tone. Additionally, you might want to think about keeping your coffee going until actual closing rather than forcing individuals to pay almost $2.00 more for an americano."
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Great croissants, we try the one whit Brie and turkey and we love it"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Nice atmosphere / ambience. Pretty decent food. I liked it.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,Love this spot. Great little cafe to work out of.
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"pretty good in a pinch, relatively quick food and sweet drinks"
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,What can you say about the modified setup for this cafe. Situated at the corner of what was once a bustling neighborhood with so much character.  All the boarded up businesses dominate the surroundings. But their coffee is second to none. And they have excellent ready to eat food options
La Boulangerie de San Francisco,500 Hayes St,"Great food but way too expensive. But they have great sandwiches, cookies and French pastries"
