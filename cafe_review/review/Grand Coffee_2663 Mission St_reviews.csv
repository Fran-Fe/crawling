Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out. The way they maximize such a small space really makes it a unique place. From the hand drawn paper cups on the wall to the plants hanging around, it's a beautiful little coffee shop with like 3 seats.  The cappuccino... It was perfect. I don't know how to say it besides that. My fiance was even asking for multiple sips and she isn't into caps like that.  If you're in the area, definitely give it a go."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Nice small coffeeshop! The barista is a great guy!
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Yup, it's a hole in the wall! You'll be glad you found this place though, the baristas were hilarious and cared about making the perfect drink. I had a flat white that was just the right amount of coffee forward but tbh the guy in front of me ordered a cappuccino that made me pretty jealous. Guess I'll have to come back soon!"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Easily one of my favorite coffee shops in S.F.  amazing baristas, great community hub, and of course amazing coffee!"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Coffee is so dang good here. I subscribe and it's the best coffee subscription I've had. It's on Mission so you get what you'd expect in terms of location.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Love this spot. I always get a latte and I’m never disappointed. Properly pulled espresso every single time.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,This is my favorite coffee shop in the San Francisco. I may be biased because it is my regular spot but it is always consistent and without pretense. It's a neighborhood spot and the coffee and the community here is real. Grab one of the four seats and settle in. Just don't take mine.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"You'll miss the spot if you're not looking for it, which is a shame since The coffee is awesome. The staff is also really nice and welcoming."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,very nice coffee. tried the cappuccino based on recommendations and was very pleased with my choice. reasonable prices too
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"If you are tired of blue bottle and ritual coffee, come to this unique and artisan coffee shop by a former four barrel barista. It’s tiny yet hearty with great Mexican art."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Grand coffee is a community, it is a great place to go for a delicious cup of coffee and company. Will keep coming here in the future, super friendly staff and owner, it's all about the people."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"A wonderful setting, excellent drinks, and friendly staff are a successful formula for success! Add the commitment to contribute, and this is a venture I'm going to endorse without a reservation. The drinks are priced fairly and you can surely tell the difference in quality. I will definitely come back for another delicious cup!"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Great little coffee place , great freindly service and fab coffee"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"My go-to spot for coffee and the most amazing, inspiring pastries. Service is always fast and friendly. When I go out for a treat, I like to get something that I would never make at home. The Grand Coffee team are specialists who know what they are doing, it's fun to see what they come up with, and always delicious! Hot tip: grab an outdoor seat at the nearby Gray Area and watch the world go by."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,It’s a tiny hole in the wall place. But the coffee was bomb. I ordered a cappuccino from here. One of the best I have had in the city.  Very friendly barista.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Great coffee, and pastries, and the works, you know when it’s early and your just wanting something to complement your work or desk or enthusiasm for your day this place is a good place that doesn’t disappoint. Has a welcoming vibe, right in the middle of 16th street Bart stop on mission and 24th Bart stop. Wall art and graffiti all over. And one of the best things is they accept Apple Pay. Popular place in the neighborhood. If caffeine is what your looking for, a small regular coffee is fine. Grand has potent cups. Cheers."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Such character, happiness, and great coffee at this hole-in-the-wall place. There are only a few seats, but conversation with the staff is super pleasant. It's one of my favorite places to caffeinate in the Mission <3"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Loved their soy cappuccino!
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Spent sometime looking for this place again after trying it for the first time last year, finally found it as I was driving thru Mission Man their coffee is good! The cappuccino personally is my favorite, must-try! Their coffee beans are from the little triangle country in Central America, Nicaragua."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Charming small cafe with eclectic decor and urban chic staff. Adrian & Jose provide cool service. Stopping here feels like stopping in for an espresso as Italian commuters do. The sweetest decaf espresso of my life! Nabil is quite talented coffee roaster (roasted weekly in small batches off-site).
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"I moved into the Mission and was searching for the best cup of coffee I could find.This hole in the wall place is now the new home of my morning cup of coffee. Even though it is a farther distance away than other places I could go, the quality of the coffee keeps me coming back. SO happy I found you guys!"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Nice coffee shop with a few seats at a bar / art gallery right next to the Alamo Draft House (we arrived early and had time to kill.  So hellloooo coffee.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"This quaint coffee shop is the former box office of an old Mission Street Theatre. They have about 4 seats inside - fun, hip staff (with great taste in music) who always know what's up the 'hood. They do fourbarrell and only offer whole milk. The owner makes some amazing iced coffee, and they have square - so no need for cash."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"One of my absolute favorite spots to get a cappuccino. It's a small spot with 2 tables outside and a few bar stools inside so don't expect to spend a lot of time chit chatting here. The baristas are really friendly and serve my favorite pastries (from Knead Pattisserie), as well as top tier chocolate bars. Definitely a spot to check out - and they offer Califia Almond Milk!"
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Absolutely spot on espresso drinks in this charming little shop
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Grand Coffee is the best kept secret in SF's coffee scene. Top notch coffee every time, a varied and interesting community of regulars and the music is always great. Check out this tiny gem."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Grand Coffee is a true neighborhood gem, particularly beloved by the AM commuter crowd. Their baristas are on point; the vibe is cozy and affable; the stereo is always playing something interesting; and they have delicious coffee and pastries. Plus you can pay with Square."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"This is a tasty little gym hidden on mission street. Super cozy small atmosphere, more of a grab and go type situation. They use four barrel coffee and it is just as tasty as down the street."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Cool, little, hipster coffee shop designed primarily for your grab-and-go. Staff were really friendly and they made a great brew. I'd love to have this shop as my local."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"The latte was good, hence the 3 stars, but I wish they had larger sizes, more tea options, and a low fat milk option. Tiny, hipster hole in the wall place that seems to tow the line for the area."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"If this is the little place I think it is, it's great. Outdoor seating only, but in a nice spot, and the guy makes Brooklyn egg creams, limeades, and iced coffee, fresh for each person on the spot."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Excellent coffee. Currently a take-out window, will soon open a bigger cafe."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,"Great little spot, very friendly."
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Found this little gem on a random morning while walking around in the mission. Really good coffee...but you gotta grab it to go because there is nowhere to sit. The staff was friendly and very efficient.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,barista ruined the vibes
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Delicious bespoke beverages with a price tag to match. But worth it? (Depends on your taste in beverages.) They are pretty tasty.
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,One of the quieter spots with a shorter line to grab a coffee in the Mission. Limited seating is available but this is definitely more of a grab and go place with a community feel
Grand Coffee,2663 Mission St,Not a huge coffee person but love stopping by here when I do want one — super friendly staff and great coffee with milk alternatives.
