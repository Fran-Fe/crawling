Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great place to get some work done out in the sun. This cafe is right opposite Duboce Triangle park. Good selection of beverages and free wifi. They have a nice indoor area too if you are not such a sun person.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Warm and welcoming. The food is great and well priced for its quality. The staff are extremely friendly and you can see the passion in their work. Shout out to Oscar for remembering my name everytime I come around and greeting me with a smile.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Great food and coffee. The service was really friendly as well. It was a fairly cold day and the doors stay open so if it is not a nice day be sure to bring your jacket, you will need it."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,We went there for brunch on a Saturday and lucky enough we got a table. The food arrived pretty quick and they are flavorful. Love the coffee as well. Will definitely be back for another lovely morning.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Stopped in with my son while visiting San Francisco and it was absolutely great. I ordered a mocha and a ham cheese croissant. My son ordered the breakfast burrito and a hot chocolate. The drinks and food was amazing. The staff was super friendly, polite and everything was brought out hot, fresh and within minutes. The atmosphere was great. Would definitely recommend."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,We happened upon Duboce Park Cafe on our walk-about in San Francisco today. It's a lovely little cafe tucked away in cute neighborhood across the street from a city park. We both ordered the everything breakfast bagel. It was light and delicious and promptly served. The coffee I ordered was divine. If you're in the area I would recommend stopping by the Duboce Park Cafe.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This place is the best. The lattes are amazing and I've never ordered any food I didn't like. The employees are the best part, super special. Thanks everyone, I bring my husband to SF for cancer treatments and you are my bright spot. God bless!!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This is a charming cafe, the food was excellent, the servers were wonderful and it really brought home the good old time San Francisco vibe that I have missed since I left there 24 years ago. Highly recommended."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I met some friends the other day at Duboce Park Cafe for Saturday breakfast. The menu is relatively expansive and the espresso drinks they make are pretty good. There is plenty of seating and it is very picturesque given that it sits right on the park. I thought the food was good, not great, hence the four star review. I would go back here since it is a convenient, and relatively inexpensive option."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Neighborhood Breakfast.....(ssshhhh, don't tell all the tourists, just the Kool ones ;) This great corner spot is the perfect short walk from MUNI N-Judah or MUNI F-line or K...or for that multi-block walk your puppy is begging for. Coffee is good. Staff is WONDERFUL! I tried the breakfast burrito and was Happy!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Ordered a curried chicken salad and was disappointed with the flavor profile, it was missing cranberries and the curry flavor was muted. It's a nice place to get a quick bite for lunch and get some sun."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,The cubano latte was tasty taste. Would ask for less sweet next time though. It was already sweetend. The buddha bowl was alright...not sure if the roasted veggies were supposed to be cold. Would not order it again. The pastrami sandwich was also mediocre.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,I had the Lox and Eggs. It was nice. Coffee is good. Service too was nice. I would recommend eating here.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Expensive but gas French toast. Orange juice also expensive but why not? Also dog friendly so I love it even more.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"On adorable Parkside Cafe, just like the name says.  Lots of out door seating a great place to grab coffee and breakfast."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I am living in Sacramento but Whenever I am going to sf , My first things I have to eat my breakfast in duboce park cafe ! My favorite food from this place is breakfast burritos, Simply it is Amazing!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Holding off on 5-Star review for the language they use on their menu is misleading to me. I got the vegan bahn mi and tater tots. “Bahn Mi” I think is used loosely for this.. sure it was delicious sandwich on a baguette but it ate more like a tropical pineapple slaw salad sandwich than a Bahn Mi. And when I hear “tater tots”, I think of those crispy delicious little potato pillows not potato wedges. Still delicious don’t get me wrong! It was disappointing given my expectations when I hear Bahn Mi & Tater Tots."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Love their Curry Chicken Sandwich.   Menu being changed at the moment.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Easily one of our favorite places to have randomly found. The food was fantastic, the staff was super friendly, vibey music, great atmosphere, super clean and nice bathroom, fresh breeze, great outdoor seating. Can't say enough good about this place. Prices were even reasonable (for San Francisco)."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Duboce Park Coffee is a great spot for breakfast. The atmosphere is quiet and pleasant, and the location is perfect. The staff is friendly, and the food is delicious. Overall, it's a great place to start your day."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Mediocre at best and very overpriced. $7 iced coffee. Nice location and outdoor seating though.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Today, Saturday, April 29. 2023. He described the service as terrible and bad. More than 50 minutes to deliver a breakfast. And the woman who attended to pay rude and in bad taste. Delivering the service. Dreadful"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,I go here for lunch and the food is great the people who work there are alright too l give them a thumbs up
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Such a relaxing experience. I had to try the Avocado Toast. A + for the added pumpkin seeds, C- for the not so toasted wheat bread. Overall a solid B. Lovely tranquil spot."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Iced vanilla latte was delicious. Things took awhile to be ready, but it’s cute enough that I didn’t mind!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Nice place Quite and clean people work there is nice and polite. Thank you
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"SUCH good food - a curried chicken salad with just the right amount of crunch from radishes, apples and fennel. My Americano was excellent and my companion’s almond latte was (apparently) great as well. Friendly service, pleasant ambience and excellent food. I highly recommend to coffee lovers as well as hungry folks in this area."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Good food, nice outdoor seating, but expensive and very bad coffee"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Good potatoes, but my veggie scramble needed a bit of salt. Nice view of the Duboce Park from the cafe."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Really nice little coffee shop, the outdoor sitting is so enjoyable ! Great atmosphere, good food and my coffee was amazing ! We bumped into this place during our walk around the neighborhood and I’m glad we stopped there."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,This place is great! I go here for lunch all the time. Their chai is delicious and all the sandwiches and egg dishes I've had are really good. It's a really cute place with friendly staff and you can watch the dogs play in the park. They also have a pretty extensive juice list although I've never tried them.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Pretty meh avocado toast and watery iced coffee. The salad bits on top of the toast seemed very limp and service was slow. We ordered oatmeal and they forgot about it entirely.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Food isn't very good. Friendly Staff. Photo below is the Buda Bowl without friend chickpeas and dressing on the side. I thought there'd be more wheat berries. It's $15 which is steep for plain veggies.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I appreciated the ample outdoor seating area. The coffee and cider were mediocre at best. The French toast was a pretty fair French toast, albeit a bit simple. The egg sandwich was a solid choice. The staff was nice, and the order was prepared pretty quickly. Judging by food alone, I'd probably give it 3 stars."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"The Sourdough English muffin was next level, I mean look at the picture, need I say more?"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great corner cafe.  Stopped by for coffee and breakfast.   Very tasty slightly innovative take on traditional favs.  Will be back!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I really like this place. Not only are the employees friendly & professional but they were surprisingly fast about everything. The staff here just seem well organized and it makes for a better overall customer experience. The outdoor seating is very nice with a view of Beautiful Duboce Park. The restrooms are also kept very clean which, although not the main thing I look for in a restaurant, is always nice. All of that plus delicious food make the Duboce Park Cafe one of my favorite places to eat in this part of the city!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,The food was mediocre but the service is the true reason why I'm giving this a bad review. Placed a to-go order over the phone. Got there 20min later only to find that the order was not placed. They spent 5min trying to figure out what happened and then decided to place an order right then but with no acknowledgement of the mess-up. The staff was less than interested in serving and almost acted like they were the ones who were inconvenienced.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Excellent neighborhood cafe / coffee shop. Outdoor seating with a view of a wonderful intersection of trains / bikes / people / cars. Great menu, service and value."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Probably one of the coolest cafes in SF.  It's right scross the street from Duboce Park. They have outside seating so you can watch doggos go crazy in the park while you enjoy your food and drink.  They have fresh juices, sandwiches and breakfast food options. Not to mention their coffee is good too."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Frustrating. On multiple occasions I’ve had missing ingredients from my meal. One time, both myself and friend got the same dish and it was missing tofu, the main ingredient of the dish… This time, I’m missing avocado from my wrap.  The food is good here when they actually prepare it correctly, but the odds of that are not great."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Coffee and fresh squeezed OJ 5 stars. The “cheese bread” is a 1. Your better off getting the bagel.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Incredible coffee and really cute eatery. Gets pretty busy in the morning, but it’s worth the wait for good food (we got breakfast sandwiches) and nice bench style seating outside when it’s acceptable weather."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Very cute spot & pleasant staff
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"The very best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. No exaggeration,  this was beautiful from top to bottom.  Love whatever bun it comes on, which sets the whole meal up for success. The arugula was fresh and flavorful, a beautiful bed for the rest of the aioli, the eggs, the fresh thin sliced tomatoes.  I can't want to go back and have it again"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This is a San Francisco gem. The coffee is strong and well concocted to be perfectly drinkable upon pickup. I strongly recommend the Breakfast Burrito (either with chorizo or the veggie option - both great). And for lunch a Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Swiss sandwich. It's sheer perfection. And the cherry on top is you can bring your meal to Duboce Park across the street and enjoy some sun and lots of cute dogs 🤗"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Food tastes amazing. Sea salt caramel latte was really good. But only hot. When it cooled it wasn't as good. Very affordable.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Disappointing…No bathrooms!!! The bathroom  door has a sign that prohibits patrons/customers from using the bathroom. When I asked the cashier if that applies to paying customers her response was “yeah…you could walk a block up to Safeway.” This was so inconvenient especially since I was dinning alone and my food and drink were at my table. If I would had known earlier I would have stopped somewhere else.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Went there this morning and got a coffee, French toast, and breakfast sandwich. It took a little while for the food to come out but they brought out the coffee straight away so the wait didn't feel as bad. I highly recommend the French toast - perfectly cooked and the banana and strawberries on the side were a great pairing. Breakfast sandwich was solid as well. Would recommend!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"First time ever I get a coffe, macchiato or espresso and get what I expected. I come from Europe and adapting to coffee in the US has been a nightmare"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Great sandwiches and coffee, and a nice spot to work when it's not too busy."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Coffee good and staff but the food wasn't that great
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Came here after a doctors appointment at 3 PM and it took them over 20 minutes to make my cappuccino…
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Below average over priced tasting food, but almost everything is healthy and the place is very nice."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Fast and friendly service. Excellent food! Really love this tucked-away (but not overly) location. Great selection of sandwiches and salads!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Cute cafe across from the park that serves a good cappuccino. Unfortunately I waited in line behind 5 people for 30 minutes and then waited another 20 minutes for two to-go drinks from the espresso bar. It became clear that they need to work out their flow (keep your barista at the bar and cashier at the register rather than doing multiple other tasks) so I can't recommend this cafe for a simple to-go coffee/tea order.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great food and atmosphere. Servers were rude and said we lied about ordering our two sandwiches. Had to prove it with receipts and still rolled their eyes.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"My favorite place in the neighborhood. K2 smoothie and an everything bagel is my go-to order but sometimes I’ll grab an egg sandwich or a croissant. The staff is so friendly too, and I’ve gotten to know a number of their names through chatting at the register. They have stickers on the floor for social distancing, tap to pay, and plenty of outdoor seating. I’m moving out of the neighborhood but will definitely be back!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Had a nice mocha. Nice ambiance with the muni train passing by with the outdoor seating
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Beautiful spot, nice staff, delicious fare."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great spot to stop along the way to downtown on the n line or if ur taking a break from the dog park across the street.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Yummy sandwich. Nice spot. Clean and friendly.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I stumbled across this location by accident on my way to the Harvey Milk Center. I'm SO happy I did! The food is fantastic! The atmosphere is simply charming and the staff are super friendly! The prices are very reasonable, so much so that I ate here every morning of my week stay in San Francisco. Your taste buds will be delighted with any of their delicious fair. Do not pass this place without trying it!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Food had fantastic presentation with food tasted bad..Had breakfast burrito that had hard. Black beans that was undercooked ,n seemed almost like veg stew in it.Too much di ced tomato"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Good variety of food and drinks for a small corner café. Chicken curry sandwich and ice cream delicious. Located near Muni station and opposite the park frequented by many dog owners. Can't wait to go there again to try the ice cream and sandwiches.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,LOVE this place. Fresh food. Quality ingredients. Very nice atmosphere. Outdoor seating with string lights.  Super cute. I went here by chance and I love it. They made my pizza by hand. Great healthy selections for kids. Casual atmosphere. Great for adults and children. Menu is quite diverse.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"First time I came there in a while -- the server and dishwashers were really nice, but one of the cashiers was pretty rude (tall guy). After I got my drink I asked if someone could wipe down the table outside (all dirty) and this cashier did one swipe across table and walked away. I ended up leaving because the trash smelled so bad (overfilled) that I couldn't bare it."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Very friendly staff with good food, coffee, and drinks. Nice place to just sit and chat. Some of their sandwiches have really thick slices of bread, so be careful there. It is good bread though"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great for a sunny day and during the week. Not packed and great views. I recommend the coffee and bagel.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,I love this cafe. Great service both times I have been here (last July 2018) and then in January 2019. I've had a bagel and coffee here and both were great. Beautiful cafe in a very beautiful part of SF. It is right by the most delightful dog park! There is outdoor seating so you will luckily get to see plenty of cute pups enjoying this cafe too.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Good coffee and a selection of pastries. Friendly staff. Tables and seating inside and outside for nice days.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Pretty expensive sandwich but good, except my sandwich didn’t have the ingredients that the menu says."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Good food, coffee, everything in this small, pleasant neighborhood spot.  Especially nice when you can sit at one of the tables out in front under the trees.  They have a good menu of breakfast choices that are more substantial than grabbing a croissant or a bagel, but they have those too. Very nice staff."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Been going here for years usually taking my dog and sitting outside. I’ve had many nice breakfasts and lunches here.  Food is good. Service lately hasn’t been as good and the cleanliness of the outside dining area has seriously deteriorated.  I’d like to see them step up their service and cleanliness.  I remain hopeful.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Quick and friendly service. I got the curried chicken salad sandwich and it was SO DELICIOUS! I wish I had ordered two. The size of the chicken chunks were just right, and the addition of radicchio & apples added just the right amount of crisp."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"One of my favorite local spots!  The food is quite good and the staff is super friendly and nice. It's a self service restaurant (you order at the counter and they bring you the food).  Specially good for brunch, work, or just chilling with friends. On specific dates they have live music at night, which is cool as well!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Terrible.... I've been working right next to this place for weeks and they never have the ingredients for the stuff they have advertised. Good luck getting a juice, cause they never seem to have fruit."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"It is a really nice spot in Duboce, good food, perfect to go with friends or family"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Really sweet spot for all day food! Their breakfast items are big, fresh, cheap, and super tasty! Friendly service and a wide range of smoothies and juices make it a really great cafe. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and eggs and it was delicious!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,We love this little cafe next to Duboce park. Their pastrami is my favorite sandwich. I get incredibly excited when we go to eat here because they are consistent and mouth watering!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Really love this place. Great outdoor dining under the trees. Away from the fumes of traffic and across from Deboce Park. Great quality...the best organic, free range meats and eggs. Extremely accommodating. No attitude. The shift manager, Sean, cooked the eggs himself, just to make me happy. Never too noisy. Free Wifi. Bright and airy inside on a cold day."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I didn't take away a star bc of some negative experience. It’s just that there are a lot of good cafes, so you gotta bring it to get top marks. This cafe has a great location, the patio is nice, and the food was better than average. People that worked there were aight, not great. Cashier was nice, though. My fellow patrons were wack, but that’s not out of the ordinary. I’ll probably go back because their smoothies are good. The problem is that it usually takes them about 15 to 20 minutes to make it. I’m not a super patient guy but I also know that 15 minutes for a smoothie is kind of pushing it. But whatever, I don’t wanna diss on them for that. We should probably slow it down and take it easy."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I ordered the Chicken Curry sandwich expecting the same sandwich that is pictured on Toast. The sandwich was small had no bacon, barely any chicken curry and it was not on a baguette. I went back and asked for a remake. The cashier took the sandwich and preceded to ask several of the staff if the sandwich actually had bacon and if it is suppose to be on a baguette. So I did not appreciate that. I thought do they know how to make their sandwiches? The second sandwich had bacon and was on a baguette but AGAIN barely any chicken curry. It was mostly bread. $16 dollars for subpar sandwich. Do not eat here. Tarragon café and Café Reveille has better portions and pricing."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"The coffee isn't half bad. And they have pastries and ice cream. The staff are friendly as well.  The outdoor seating is pretty fantastic. You get views of Duboce park and the Lower Haight is overall a great and lively neighborhood. And you're at a center of it.  Situated near the N line, it's fairly easy to get there. Make a quick stop to grab a coffee to go, stay indoors to enjoy the WiFi, or hand out outside and have a lovely conversation with friends. It's a good spot for all of those."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Terrific place for a caffe latte and working long enough to purchase a more substantial meal. The smoothies are delicious and nutritious, too! The cinnamon roll is really tasty, but I wasn't a fan of the gluten-free blueberry muffin. It was too dense for me."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,UPDATE: Burrito lost flavour (tried a couple of times) and service really went downhill. Updating from 5 to 2 stars  Best breakfast burrito I've had in a while. The pico de gallo sauce and the beans are fantastic! The chorizo is spectacular  It's so good that I've been here a few times and that's the only item on the menu I've order so far
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Duboce cafe is all about the location, right next to the park. I ordered a slice of pumpkin bread one afternoon for $4.50. At those prices I expect fresh-baked at the level of Tartine. I found the bread most but decidedly lacking in flavor and somewhat grainy. If you’re looking for outdoor seating in a relaxing area, check it out. Otherwise, I’d pass. I haven’t tried their brunch though."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Awesome cafe to grab breakfast and then hang out at Duboce Park.  Their lox bagel is done very well and is amazing!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I like to leave more in-depth reviews once I've been a regular for awhile - as that's the only way for me to truly evaluate a service/restaurant and give my honest opinion. Consistency is key! What a charming cafe! This place is like a breath of fresh air - it's a excellent atmosphere. The food is a little expensive, but a nice treat as it's always yummy. I've never been disappointed with quality or customer service. I come here early in the morning on the weekends (to avoid the crowds) and am able to get a lot of homework done. I also love dogs, a lot (no.. seriously. a lot you do not understand.) But am not in a place in my life where I can have my own furry friend. Another major motivation for coming here is that you're BOUND to meet someone's nice furry companion. One of my favorite things to do is sit outside and sip at a coffee while in awe at all the wonderful fur babies with their humans walking by. If you wish for it enough and your heart is pure (or, you know, just ask the human, nicely!!) they'll even let you say hi and give them a few pets. Someone let me give their beautiful golden a treat once after asking her to sit. 😍😍 And finally.. my opinion still stands, they have the best cold brew within a walking distance from my house. Keep it up! I moved into the neighborhood 9 months ago and you got yourself a returning customer."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"It's ok. Not too interesting, usually pretty crowded with Park crowd - so you will see a lot of dogs. My SO lives near here and we rarely go - there's just more interesting food for that price nearby.  Others seem to love it"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"It's a very nice small neighborhood cafe.  I've lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and really appreciate a small business that's clean and well-run.  They do a good job.  Food is pricey but good.  My big complaint is that the line to get food can get very long, but that's just proof that customers like this place."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Ordered a Buddha bowl and a hummus plate. Was told after paying with a generous tip that there was no Buddha bowl. Got a vegan wrap instead. Only the vegan wrap came. I asked for a refund for the meal and was told I couldn't have any. They gave me refund for hummus plate only because we started eating other meal, they also wouldn't return any of the generous tip. Don't go to this cafe, worst experience I've had living in the bay area."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"One of the only places directly next to duboce park to grab a snack and coffee. Always have loved this spot, nice outdoor seating and sliding windows as well."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Just ok. Not bad, not great. The location is by far its best attribute. Some of the sandwiches are yummy (I think their pastrami one is great) and some of their smoothies are yummy.  But generally, just ok."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This is located right next to Duboce park so if you love seeing doggos pass by you’ll love grabbing a coffee here. It’s a little expensive (as is life in SF) but they have tons of healthy and delicious food options as well as juices and smoothies. Perfect place to catch up with a friend, read and sip or enjoy the day!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Always swing by for coffee and sit outside. Good coffee. Staff are V nice & thoughtful. Great place- just wish customers actually drank coffee or dined in. Way too many ppl there on their computers- HATE THAT CULTURE.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Typical San Francisco coffee house/cafe.  Location is very convenient for drivers.  Across the street from Duboce park. Food is above average.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Always love this place. Good staff. Nice area. Menu has recently been expanded with some great new vegan/veg options. My go to place if I need a coffee, snack, or even a quick ice cream cone ;)."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Nice little cafe with outdoor seating overlooking a park. Plenty of options for food and drink, but a bit pricey for very standard dishes. There is good quality free WiFi and many people come and hang out there with their laptops."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Well lit with outdoor seating, this little cafe located across of Duboce Park is only reliable if you need food in a pinch. There's usually very little wait for a table, the staff is nice, and it's clean and bright. Their soy chai smoothie came up a little short on flavor, but they do sell quite few pastries that were better. The french toast looked great, but didn't move any bridges. They've got sandwiches, which might be better and a lot of other options like green smoothies and Vogue chocolate bars."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"We came for the visiting dogs and were not disappointed :-) The breakfast food was great, as was the coffee. My husband is GF and was able to get the breakfast burrito w/out the tortilla. Next time we'll try one of the juices, which looked delicious."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Cozy little cafe right across the street from Duboce Park with indoor and outdoor seating. Dog and kid friendly. Serves breakfast until 5pm.  Also serves beer and wine ! Good breakfast choices (lox bagel, egg and cheese sandwich, egg scrambles and fresh pastries.)"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"We came in during a busy Saturday afternoon. The service was absolutely horrific. Everything I ordered was entered into the register with a sigh and an eye roll. Everyone seemed incredibly unhappy to be there. The food was just ok. For the prices I expected better. I suspect this business does well based on location, but I will gladly go elsewhere next time I'm out for lunch."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"First visit. The food was prepared nicely. The mixed leaf salad was refreshing and I throughly enjoyed the oil/vinegar dressing. Ruben sandwich was excellent for my taste. Company had an expresso that had a detailed flower design, as expected. A little crowded, but comfortable for four people at a table. Fairly priced for the value of the meals ordered. Self serve on water refills No refills on coffee or speciality drinks, one serving only. Cash and credit card is acceptable. I would hang out at the Diboce Park Cafe."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,The reason this place always has people in is that their menu is consistently tasty - never had a bad meal. Suitable for vegetarians. Prices could be lower but at least I know I'm getting quality. Lots of parking. Recommend the pastries as well.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Best turkey, bacon, avacodo sandwich in the city. Add a fresh juice smoothie with a small bag of chips and you've got a delicious, light lunch. You can eat outside in the sun and talk with locals."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Seitan sandwiches! Really good sandwiches and salads here. I also tried a chocolate tart here once and it was delicious.  I wish they had more smoothies though - I've been looking for a great smoothie forever and had high hopes for their pear one. They were out of half the ingredients, so I still haven't tried the pear smoothie, but their substituted version wasn't remarkable."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Our favorite for a healthy, delicious lunch, with great people watching. Excellent coffee and pastries too."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This used to be one of my favorite brunch / quick bite places (great ambiance, super convenient, and good staff), but I feel it has fallen by the wayside in the last 6 months or so. On more than 3 occasions, I've ordered a vegetarian version of something on the menu - e.g. last couple of times it was no ham in the breakfast burrito - and despite being assured that they can do the substitute, I end up with a meat version. Listen, I'm not vegetarian or halal, but ham makes me sick to my stomach. Please don't tell me you can sub if you can't. I will not be returning to spend more money on food that doesn't deliver on what's promised."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Food is good but the service is pretty unwelcoming. Seemed like they were just always annoyed at customers for being there and ordering food/drinks. I loved this place when I lived across the street and went frequently, but the unwelcoming staff made me avoid it."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This is a cute corner cafe with a few outdoor tables and great views of the Duboce Dog park (if you're a dog stalker like me). They carry Equator coffee and lots of tasty snacks, like their alfajores. I haven't loved everything off their menu, but if you're there for brunch, the Duboce egg sandwich is good. For dinner, I love the cob salad."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Thought I would support a local business today for lunch and decided on Duboce Park Cafe as it looked inviting. I ordered the Turkey, Bacon and Swiss and the Beet Smoothie, which totaled somewhere around $26.00 and a half dollars because I tipped. I regret the tip as I noticed the server delivering a patron's coffee next to me and then yelling my name to pick up my drink at the counter. The drinks were ready simultaneously, but there was obviously preferential treatment for the gym bunny. When my sandwich was ready, he slung it over the counter and stretched his arm to the table I was sitting at. The glances from fellow patrons was enough to embarrass me and I told the server/counter person exactly how I felt and walked out. The server was Hispanic male somewhat tall with curly hair with obvious biases.  In terms of the food, the sandwich was dry and did not have the swiss cheese and the beat smoothie for $7.95 was served warm and was 8oz instead of the 12oz stated on the menu. At this price, I think I could have done much better at Whole Foods and avoided the embarrassment.  NOW THE OWNER WANTS TO QUESTION WHETHER I WAS THERE, DO I NEED TO LOCATE THE RECEIPT ON MY CREDIT CARD.? THE COUNTER PERSON WAS THE YOUNG MUSCLE GUY WITH DARK HAIR AND COMPLEXION (LATINO?) AND THERE WAS ALSO A FEMALE WORKING THE COUNTER WHO I DID NOT INTREACT WITH. WHY NOT OWN YOUR SHIZZ AND ASK FOR MY NUMBER OR CONTACT ME.? I CAN PROVIDE PROOF OF MY VISIT.. DO NOT ADD INSULT TO INJURY BY CALLING ME A LIAR. THIS IS NO WAY TO OPERATE A BUSINESS, THERE IS SERIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH PEOPLE THESE DAYS. GO TO WHOLE FOODS DOWN THE STREET, THE SANDWHICH WILL BE BETTER. LASTLY, I AM NOT YOUR NEIGHBOR AND YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR OWN ADVICE AND ""WORK IT OUT,"" WHATEVER THIS MEANS."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This is a really cute cafe in an adorable neighborhood. I love the low-key vibe and the people watching. To eat, try the Divine Veggie sandwich -- so healthy and satisfying. The Vietnamese chicken salad is also good, but perhaps a bit TOO healthy -- would be nice if there were a little less cabbage, and maybe the addition of some vermicelli noodles or a bit more chicken. The Duboce Egg sandwich is lovely and indulgent. The green juice is also really good. All in all, a neighborhood gem with solid food and a very San Francisco, chill vibe."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Perfect brunch place!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Good beverage selection and friendly staff!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,I had a pesto turkey sandwich.  It's delicious but it would've been better if the cafe used house made turkey rather than those packaged turkey from grocery.  It's a nice little clean cafe.  However ventilation is bad.  So you'll pick up all the kitchen smell when sitting inside.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"This used to be one of my favorite places but the menu remains the same and I feel like they are just dialing in. My Salmon Scramble Eggs were missing the cream cheese, the potatoes were overcooked and cold as well as the English Muffin (which was missing butter). It's just become moderately okay place.  What it does have is location. As the name alludes, it's directly across from Duboce Park. It's right next to the light rail train. On warmer days, theres a nice amount of outside seating under the trees."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"It pains me a bit to give this place only three stars. It has a good menu, and serves a need in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, the food can be a bit spotty. I had a wholly mediocre, barely toasted Reuben sandwich and it always seems like the wait for the bathroom here is interminable."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,If you're at the park and you want a little wine and a nosh this is the perfect place for you. We enjoy coming here with friends we meet at the park. It's pretty chill and there's outdoor seating if you have your dog.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Really nice sandwiches and breakfast foods. Excellent smoothies and the dog park next door is the best!  Can be hard to find seating, but as long as you're willing to wait a little you'll find a spot."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Great outlook and very cute spot, they also seemed to have improved their espresso….sandwich was also great !"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Is a coffee shop and they don’t have enough bread bad
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"When I'm in Duboce Park and feeling hungry, I head over here and order a breakfast sandwich. They put ripe tomatoes and arugula on it and serve it open-faced. It's so delicious! Top it off with a cold ice tea and it's a perfect breakfast or lunch. Since it's across the street from a dog park, there are always people sitting outside with their dogs and often people with laptops inside. There's a bathroom up a few stairs in the back."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Really nice spot for drinks and food.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"The location is worth 5 stars.  The coffee is decent, juices are solid, but the food is hit-or-miss.  The main reason for 3 stars is the slooooow (and sometimes grumpy) service that results in lines that regularly run out the door."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Got the K2 and the Big Red. Both were good, but I preferred the K2 - the combo of ginger and beet was a bit weird for me. Staff was lovely and order was ready quickly."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Decent place for breakfast or lunch. The breakfast menu is huge and sprawling. Good fruit and yogurt and decent omelettes. The coffee is okay but nothing to write home about. This is an okay place to go but nothing special and not the type of place you would want to go out of your way to visit.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Loved their special fresh juices, particularly those based on beets. They also offer a nice selection of soups and sandwiches. Seating both indoors and, when weather permits, outside on sidewalk tables."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I ordered a tuna melt and sat down to eat it.  After some futzing and an astonishing display of ineptitude with cutlery, managed to launch one half of it off of my plate and onto the floor.  Pablo saw me clean up and noticed how dispirited I was.  A minute later, he swooped by the table and dropped off a replacement.  I nearly cried.  It was a really sweet gesture and made my day after a particularly stressful patch."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Lovely staff, quick meal prep. The Cobb salad was good, the raspberry muffin unfortunately underbaked. Nice vibe and cool crowd."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Amazing food, staff is friendly. Due to limitations, the place constantly gets packed. Maybe plan coming here with some extra time to spare. Food is amazing, and you can wait a while. But definitely worth it"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Made a pit stop here. The waiter was really rude for no reason, pizza was burning hot and undercooked at the same time. Would not recommend."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Great food and atmosphere, but wifi is unusably slow (and other patrons concurred). Also, no outlets. I learned this two years ago and decided to try again today. I'd prefer that they drop wifi altogether.  If you're looking for a place to work, this probably isn't it. Too bad.  Response to owner: Thank you! I look forward to trying again. FWIW, my neighboring patrons were having the same problem. (Also, having a ""Duboce Park Fast"" network implies that ""Duboce Park Free"" is slower. Perhaps that's not ideal branding!) I appreciate your reply."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great place for breakfast. American style breakfast but had some welcome healthy options (coming from Australia we often struggle with their breakfasts when looking for something more healthy). Returned a few times.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Food is good, but they need TWO registers! Always a line and it moves slowly! I ordered for pickup and still had to wait in line while my prepared food grew cold 😟 …"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great dude running the place good selection of sandwiches. Icecream candy donuts open kinda late. Parking could be a problem. Close to Balboa park and the skate park. No atmosphere seating limited.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Great indoor and outdoor seating. I went there for Sunday brunch and was seated instantly. They have good breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their green machine smoothie is a must."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Good Cuban Latte. They need to work on their customer service and the communication between the staff.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Charming local spot with such lovely and friendly staff! The curry chicken salad is AMAZING! Highly recommend! So yummy!!!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,The food was really good and There is a Park just across the street perfect to bring your dog and do a picnic!
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"I was there today for the first time, had the best breakfast sandwich and smoothie in the area! The employee that took my order was very helpful and professional. Thanks"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Great atmosphere, food, and location. Music is often a little too loud and their drip coffee is subpart, but beyond those two issues it's a great place. One of my favorite coffee shops in the bay area."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Loved the food and the coffee. Dined outside. Such a serene and quite part of SF! Loved visiting and would go again.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"Very nice cafe. Food is great, people very relaxed. We have been there three times during our four day visit if San Francisco. Would definitely come back again!"
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Excellent spot for lunch with a baby! The food was outstanding. I had the hummus plate and it was delicious.  Great location and many choices for breakfast and lunch.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,"It was great food, I ordered lox scrambled and French toast. It tasted really good, I loved the food and the latte."
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Cute little cafe with inside and outside seating
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Great location overlooking Duboce Park. Very tasty breakfast burrito and pumpkin chai latte with oatmilk. Friendly and efficient service.
Duboce Park Cafe,2 Sanchez St,Good coffee and good selection of food . Love it
