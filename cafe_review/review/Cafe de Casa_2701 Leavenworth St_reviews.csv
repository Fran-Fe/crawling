Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Small cute cafe close to Fisherman Wharf’s. There were already people waiting in line before they opened at 8. We decided to take a stroll and came back at 8.05. There was line out of the door. We were lucky to get a table inside and waited about 10-15 minutes for our order to arrive. We ordered an iced americano, coffee with milk, and tapioca crepe with veggie omelette. This was first time trying the tapioca crepe and I was not disappointed. they have variety of options to choose from for breakfast. Customer service was great. If you are in the area then please do visit this place."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Not very far away from the Fisherman’s wharf and the cable car turnaround near pier 39. We have never had Brazilian food and we were very much impressed by this restaurant. They have very good vegetarian options and their coffee with chocolate was too good. The only disadvantage is this is not very big and you  might not get a table as easily as you could get in other restaurants. Gets pretty crowded, so sooner you go, better it would be for you."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I am so happy I randomly decided to walk up and try this Brazilian cafe. The food here is simply exceptional. The açaí bowl is not overly sweet, and the torta De Frango is so good. The crust, cheese, and chicken all go together perfectly. The only thing I didn’t like was the tapioca omelette, just personally felt like the texture of the dough / taste didn’t add anything to the food. Make sure you get the hot sauce to add to the food too it brings it all together. Lastly I think the iced coffee was pretty good too.  Every time I’ve gone the cafe has been packed. It doesn’t have too much of a vibe, but the exceptional  food really carried the cafe. Easily one of the best overall cafes I’ve been to in SF."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious food! Service was very quick. Line gets out the door so the inside can get very crowded, but there is also outside seating. The crepes are delicious. If you've never had it before, it's an interesting texture - rough on the top but chewy on the inside.  They are small enough to share if you are weary on food textures.  Love the fact that they sell the cheese bread frozen to take home. If I wasn't traveling I would have definitely grabbed a bag or two!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cafe de Casa is a Brazillain Cafe near my hotel. The portions are fair, the coffee is tasty, and the food, consistently over the 5 days I went, was good. If you want fresh juices with no additives or if you need flour less options, this is a fantastic place to go.  My only complaint is the size of the cafe- it's TINY. Go outside of the morning rush and you will have a better experience ♡"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Wonderful little street side restaurant. Food is very tasty and fresh.  A bit of a cliche, but the smell when entering the restaurant is amazing!  Staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Seating is limited so coming off peak or even pickup may help."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"10/10! We were so excited that this cute little place was only a block from our hotel while visiting SF for the weekend. Our family had several of their items: cheese bread ham and cheese sandwich, carrot cake, coxinha, passion fruit juice, and several others and everything tasted amazing. The only ""bad"" thing about this place is that it's not open on Sundays! We were bummed when we went to grab breakfast, and it was closed. We loved it that much! We just wanted more, and we were leaving that night. lol. You guys have an amazing place, and I wish our town had one just like it! As a Brazilian living in the US for 25 years, this brought me back home! Thank you."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,The food was delicious. Quite fulling and different if you haven't try Brazilian cuisine. The service was excellent. They didn't take long to serve and were polite. It was a very cozy place.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,We love coming to this cute little Brazilian cafe after swimming at aquatic park. They have tons of gluten free options and delicious baked goods! I had the cheese bread sandwich with chicken and my friend got the vegan crepe.  They have a rotating menu of pastries on the weekends and I loved the donut with guava jam. Their carrot cake with chocolate ganache drizzle was a bit dry. Coconut fluffy rolls are scrumptious there!!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I went twice, tried the Origonal acai which was great, tried the cheese salmon sandwich was okay, tried the coconut bread with Mozzarella which was nice and tried the vegetarian eggs and crepe, which was below average. Generally speaking only go for ACAI this is what they excel in."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Brazilian menu is very good.  Busy Cafe but waiting to order is fast.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,The açaí bowl was delicious topped with raw Gogi berries delivered an energy boost. The Brazilian coffee and coconut bread is tasty as well. Cafe de Casa was our sole choice for breakfast. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food is good here both dine in (inside space is small) or outside and take out.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The tapioca breakfast crepe was very good.  Was surprised at how the tapioca crepe tasted but with the eggs and ham, it pulled together wonderfully. The acai cup was okay, but didn't hit like we thought it would.  The toast was incredible!!  Very lovely place.  Will hit it again, for sure."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Small place with wonderful staff. I tried their acai bowls, pan de queso, coconut bread with cheese filling all absolutely amazing."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I couldn’t be happier with our choice for brunch! We ordered a cheese bread sandwich, Torta de Frango, and Carrot cake! All three were delicious, filling, and enjoyable in the inviting setting of the restaurant. I’d recommend this spot for anyone in the area looking for a quick bite or a full meal. The carrot cake was tasty but more citrus-forward than I would have expected. Tasty, but different!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Amazing Brazilian Food! Had the Sertaneja tapioca flour crepe and Guarana Antarctica soda.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,A nice little breakfast café by the roadside. The coffee was good. The tapioca wrap tasted super weird…but the avocado was plentiful and the fruit was fresh. Their baked items were exquisite. I would go back for those. Definitely a fun little place to check out and there is a parking lot just around the corner so you can go walk around a bit by the waterfront and check out the shops.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great spot for breakfast! The pour over coffee was well prepared. Had a ham and cheese breakfast sandwich on French bread that was tasty. Pro tip: try their house made hot sauce - it's tasty with a pretty decent kick to it
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cosy and really popular breakfast place, if you get there later in the morning then expect to wait in line for at least 20 min. You need to be clever when you want to have a good outdoor seating there: either ask to join someone or let your friend look around! Delicious açai bowl!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,I got there around 8ish as they open at 8. There were already people in line! Really popular place. Love their açai bowl! Good place for breakfast! 아침먹기좋은곳입니다!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"This place is really authentic! My Brazilian husband and I checked it out and the food/drink is the real thing. Just like you would get in Brazil. There are lots of gluten free options and the açaí is so fun to find! We would recommend it to anyone for breakfast, lunch or a snack."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Been here three times now and each food item has been delicious! The staff has been very friendly and sitting outside has been wonderful each time! It gets a little busy but has definitely been worth visiting!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Got the Abracadinho de Salsicha which is described as “bread dough filled with sausage, bacon, cheese, and tomato” It ended up just being a cheap hot dog in the pastry. The chicken pot pie wasn’t five star either, not sure why this place is so highly rated."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,It's super tiny inside and can get extremely busy. There is not a lot of seating when busy. Gluten-free options but minimal dairy-free and Brazilian cheese bread here.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The servers were rude and not friendly. The food was so so. I was served a raw pastry, which looked cooked on the outside. I kindly, and quietly, made them aware of the issue and was met with a frosty reply. In addition, the servers did not remove the pastry from the window for sale. This is a potential health hazard. Sadly, I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Ohhhh I had such a lovely breakfast in this cafe on my second day in San Francisco!! It's located very strategically close to the fisherman piers but is aside from the busiest streets near the seaside! I had this lovely coconut bread with melted cheese inside, delicious!!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cute little coffee and bakery shop. Has delicious Brazilian pastries that are sweet and savory. Got the Carrot Cake Bolo de Cenoura. It's a carrot cake with chocolate drizzle over it. It tasted more like an orange cake than a carrot cake. It was still tasty, wouldn't order it again. Got an iced coffee also. They have bar seating inside and areas outside to eat. Easy walk from Ghirardelli Chocolate Company."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"AMAZING. My husband lived in Brazil for 2 years, and we were BLOWN away at how authentic it is! He said he felt like he was transported back to Brazil. Thank you cafe de casa for a wonderful breakfast/brunch!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Everytime there is a queue. 20-25 min waiting time but when you ordered quick service. You can sit outside. Different taste but delicious.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Perfect breakfast/brunch spot. There’s not much space inside but there’s some tables outside. Both savory and sweet options are delicious
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,I'm not Brazilian but my husband is. We spent 5 days in SF with his family. And guess where we went for breakfast every morning?  Cafe de casa. And my in-laws live in Brazil!  So can definitely say - Brazilian approved. And American approved too. Nothing starts the day like a fresh pão de queijo.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The best Brazilian cafe of San Francisco. I am Brazilian and I know what I am talking about. Delicious options, fresh, warm. I'd eat here every meal every day."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Authentic Brazilian food is served here. The tapiocas were really good. 😍 Also, the pão de queijo was great. Lovely place with a lovely atmosphere. Really worth the visit."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cute little cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Staff is a little short/cold but they were very busy when I came. Expect a line in the morning, even on weekdays! They do not have lattes per say but they can add milk (regular or dairy free) to your coffee. The coffee is smooth and tasty! I enjoyed my coffee at the bar facing the window letting much sunlight in, and was able to charge my phone."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great place to start your day before the bike tour over golden gate bridge. Great coffee. Try the Coxinha and peanut acai bowl! Guess it can be a bit much traffic in rush hours. Was there very early and the sun was warming on a otherwise mild morning. Go there!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Nice little joint. Super helpful and tasty. Line gets long but your spot for a good fresh breakfast
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Great breakfast place. Brazilian breakfast sandwiches, crepes, sweet bread and excellent coffee. A must try place."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Convenient location, healthy menu options, reasonable prices and fast service. We ordered tapioca crepes, egg sandwich, avocado mozzarella toast and fresh orange juice. I loved their Brazilian bread. This place is a must try in Fishermans Warf 😊 …"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,The guava mozzarela crepe was beyond delicious. The variety of flavors all complimented other so well. The original acai bowl was filling and needed  hearty pick me up.  Def will be back.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I enjoyed their tapioca crepes a lot - it's unusual at first, then you realise how good it is as you keep going. The pao de queijo is perfection in a ball. They serve only drip coffee but it's ground fresh and they offer mild, medium and dark roast. This cute spot is full of heart. My bf who grew up in Brazil thought it was great also."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"SF doesn’t lend itself to small breakfast portions (and their small margins), but they do it right here. You have a range of options, sandwiches, crepes, açaí, stuffed pastries- all with good flavor. A lock to be a regular destination if you live nearby. Order on their website for takeout, it’s always packed."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Very unique and yummy food, and great pour over coffee!  The food comes out on such bright happy plates, and is unlike anything you can really get elsewhere in the city. We had their crepes, which are made with tapioca flour. Very interesting texture and flavor, with a bit of olive oil as a flourish!  Good variety of fun little pastries as well. Oh! And the juice was fresh squeezed and fantastic!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The food was amazing and I was totally blindsided by the OJ getting squeezed fresh! My husband drinks his coffee black and enjoyed their brew as well. Fresh fruit with crepes, great coffee and fresh squeezed juice. I will come back here when I come back to San Francisco and try their pastries 💖 …"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Nice stop close to the popular hot spots in San Francisco. The coffee chocolate was so creamy and warm on a cool SF day. Also had the tapioca crepes. One was vegan with greens, eggplant & tomato filling. The other was nutella and fresh strawberries"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Friendly service, fantastic breakfast. The salmon and Brazilian breakfast sandwich was melt in your mouth. Highly recommend!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious Brazilian food! We visited on June 20th. Service is great! Staff is kind and gentle. Despite of the longe Line at 10am, service was fast. We had coxinha, pão na chapa and carrot cake: all 3 super Brazilian food recipes.If you’re a Brazilian living in the USA, come so that you don’t miss home so much. If you’re not Brazilian, come and find out why we Brazilians are so happy! 😃"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"10/10! We went 2 days in a row for breakfast.  Great cheese bread and French bread sandwiches, acai bowls, juices, coffee, and much more!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Lovey little cafe. Tasty açaí bowl is so rejuvenating as an afternoon snack. Friendly service makes everyone feel at home.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"It's hard to find a good, authentic açai bowl like i used to know them from brazil. But this one is the best one I had so far especially with my favorite toppings: leite ninho and leite condensado ❤️"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Very very good.  Must try if you are in the area. Cheesy Bread with beef.  I want more!!! The delicious coffee is the bonus! Literally ate it before we decided to take pics!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Stepped in for some breakfast today and had a great Brazilian style omelette and amazing vanilla iced coffee. Definitely worth a try! They even have delicious looking savoury/sweet pastries. Thanks!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"San Francisco has many little gems and this one is certainly one of them. I was in the city briefly and every morning I walked down to the cafe and had an acai bowl. Best acai bowl I've ever had and you'd be a fool to not give it a go. Lovely people and beautiful atmosphere which makes it a really enjoyable meal. Great location as it is a short walk from many touresty things which is perfect if you want a quick bite before activities like the Alcatraz tour. In all honesty, this place is one of the top reasons I want to visit the city again."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"We spent a week across the street at the excellent hotel caza, and ate brunch here daily.  Every dish and.beverage is prepared and served with care by the friendly and dedicated staff.  This is a place to go when quality is more important to you than speed. The pour-over coffee is so good.  The Acai bowl my favorite meal. My wife liked the omelette tapioca."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"This place is simple & wonderful- it is simply wonderful. Beautiful Brazilian pastry’s, fresh & delish açaí bowls, pour over coffee that warms your soul, and a delightful staff that makes you feel welcome."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"We decided to take our breakfast with us and enjoy it at the beach. Our açaí bowls and coffees were good, friendly stuff!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"They serve SOLID Brazilian snacks, I'd recommend this place to anyone interested in trying the Brazilian cusine, I particularly love the coxinhas, brigadeiro, risole and the pão de queijo. Awesome!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The best açai bowl, so refreshing… And The pineapple mint made my day"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Amazing gluten free cafe for breakfast and lunch. Food is so tasty and really friendly staff
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Cafe de Casa is one of the best Brazilian restaurant I’ve been! Food is really good!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Amazing food and coffee! Neat little place.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Great place for breakfast. The food was fresh, and pastries were awesome. Will definitely come back"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,I love this place. Excellent breakfast. Always packed for a reason!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Incredible breakfast spot for a unique start to your day. Excellent GF crepes with amazing choices in filling. Do not go without getting the guava jelly filled donut, it will change your perspective on donuts."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The food was good , but the service REALLY SLOW ! 25’ for 1 açaí bowl! If you decide to come don’t be in rush or hungry! Hope the improve the service!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Authentic Brazilian Acai bowls for breakfast. It was my first time trying and I really enjoyed the sweet and cold bowl with granola and fresh berries. We sat outside because it can get very busy inside while people stand in line to order. The road just next to us did not bother us at all but could bother others. I recommend you try a cup first if you are unsure whether you will like it, as I saw some people barely eating any of their bowl because it was not their taste. For a sweeter option try the peanut butter bowl with condensed milk."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,One of my favorite morning stops while visiting San Francisco. The coffee is amazing and the food is simple but delicious.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"This quaint little Brazilian cafe is a nice spot for some coffee and a pastry. I ordered the breakfast, which took about 20 to be ready, but that may have been due to how busy it was. The cafe is very small and seating is limited. On this day, they had a Brazilian folk singer in shop, which was a nice touch."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,The people here are so sweet!! The atmosphere is great- perfect place to grab a bite to eat and define you sit outside. I come here at least once a week for the gluten free (celiac friendly) cheesy bread. Tried their coffee today and it is out of this world!!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Fun breakfast! The Brazilian crepes were different and tasty - the açai bowl was light and fruity - coconut bun was super fresh
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Very nice small coffee place, can get very busy on weekends. Great selection of Tapioca omelettes. Nice Acai bowls. Nice tasty pour over coffee freshly made and from a local coffee roastery."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Had breakfast which was good and sat out, one thing rather weird is the feeling since the street is slanted. Stayed not far so just walked, will come again."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"LOVELY +++ The Avocado sandwich was AMAZING, same with the Tapiocas. Nice coffee too. Great service :-)"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Delicious Brazilian style breakfast. We've had cheesy bread before but never in a sandwich form. They had a wonderful hot sauce made from a Brazilian pepper that went well with the sandwiches. Bit of a line when we got there but we were already eating within 20 mins. They have both inside and outside tables.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Terrible service. Rude, unhelpful. These people should get out of service industry! We arrived 20 minutes before 2PM closing. 3 kids were eager/excited to eat a long awaited treat (Crepes there at shop). When the crepes finally came out, they brought them in a to-go box at 1:55PM (Even though we specified to eat in when ordering). When I asked about it, they said ""sorry we close in 5 minutes so take them w/ you"" My 3 young kids even commented how rude they seemed. What a shame to work in a service industry, Cafe & act in this way. Meanwhile it was pouring rain outside, so no eating outdoors & the only option was to eat the messy, sticky, Nutella crepes in car. We Will Not be  going back to that service dump:("
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great nice environment place...you feel the good vibes visiting from Chicago we totally coming back
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Brazilian crepes are interesting... Made of tapioca flour. It grew on me
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Excellent small cafe and coffee shop not far from water front. Interesting sandwiches such as egg, bacon, avacado."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Great little Brazilian cafe nestled between lombard st and fisherman’s wharf. The pastries are good and taste just as good as most places in Brazil. Lots of Brazilians go here so I like when I want to reminisce and feel like i’m back in Brazil  If you go, be sure to try the coxinha (pictured below) which is very unique and incredibly delicious. A little pricy at $4.88 for one but it’s worth the experience. There’s usually free parking near so you can park then walk down to fisherman’s wharf.  8/10 muito bom!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Gluten-free options galore! Delicious cheese bread. Forgot I was eating a gluten-free sandwich. My husband and I ordered the salmon and cream cheese, fried egg, avocado, and bacon, and the guava jelly with mozzarella crepe. So good!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Laid-back, relaxed atmosphere. The waiters and waitresses were super nice and friendly"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The truest taste of acai bowls, tapioca crepes, and cheesey bread that you can find in sfbay. There's another one in ssf, it tastes like being back in Rio (but without tapioca topping for the acai bowls, sigh, I sometimes bring own hehe)"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Amazing food and super friendly people! Absolutely loved coming here for breakfast. Everything is delicious and so fresh!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"This is a great place for breakfast or lunch, great location and friendly staff. The coffee is really good too. I would recommend ordering online in advance to avoid the long wait."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Yummy, and very pretty food"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious family breakfast! My açai smoothie was great, my daughter loved her strawberry and Nutella pancake and my husband and other daughter devoured their cheese and ham toasties. The coffee was full of flavour and the juices (one passion fruit and one pineapple) were amazing.  A great find, we’d be back if we lived closer! Definitely recommend if you’re in SF."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The texture of the crepe was unusual, pebbly like a cotton washcloth and slightly chewy. A thin layer of egg and bacon sandwiched inside were good but typical. Exactly 3 pieces each of pineapple, honeydew, watermelon and a spoon full of salty melted butter completed the dish. No drink or side and my total with a tip was about $13, seemed expensive for a simple dish and portion size."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Super yummy place, the tapioka veggie omllete is just delicious, and their gluten free breads are amazing. Their coffee is amazing aswell, not like the average American coffee in other places"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Long line, service you would presume, good food and drink."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Brazilian inspired food in a neighbourhood setting. Food was good and service very polite
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious coconut açaí!  Place is clean, well staffed and upbeat. Several options to choose from with good healthy alternatives."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Fantastic breakfast place with a lot of gluten free options!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Good and products are worth trying. If they’re rude to you just don’t tip them they’ll get the point. Couldn’t believe my first time here 🥲
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,The humble pour over is exceptionally good.  Breakfast crepes and sandwiches are ok.  Friendly staff working hard but it takes a lifetime of waiting to get your food and drink.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Really nice brazilian place. The staff is super friendly and efficient and the prices are fair. I've eaten the best coxinha of my whole life in this place - and I'm brazilian. Pão de queijo was also amazing! It's a pity they close at 2pm because it would be an amazing place to relax and read while having an afternoon coffee.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Just stopped in for a snack, had two delicious items, very friendly."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Amazing breakfast. Great coffee. Staff was awesome. Love this place.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious tapioca crepes! Unique flavor, especially if you’re gluten free.  I wish they had a coffee barista to complete the meal"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"You can't go wrong with breakfast here  Just really well made, authentic Brazilian eats."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Cafe de Casa is a really nice little cafe. Their Misto Quente is very very good despite its simplicity. I think they definitely captured the atmosphere and vibe of Brazil in their food--can't ask for much more than that!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,So many great gluten free options…Crepes and the cheese bread! Fresh juice and really great pour overs. One of our favorite stops in the city.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"This place is awesome! Run by a super friendly family of Brazilians, the food is the real deal.  Their açaí bowls are better than any of the speciality açaí places I’ve tried in the city (not naming names here…) Their cheese bread (and sandwiches) are oh so tasty.  Im vegetarian, so their options are somewhat limited, but everything I can eat is awesome! (For those pure vegans, the only option is the açaí bowl without condensed milk, but it’s still totally worth it!) For the carnivores, I must say the wonderful aroma makes me reevaluate my dietary choices every time I walk in.  If you’re hungry in/around Fisherman’s Wharf you won’t find a better breakfast or lunch!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Nice place for breakfast The food was good and so was the service
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Original brazilian food. A little bite expensive if you eat coffee, a dish and a drink. Good wifi."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I've given this place, one too many tries. This place is the worst for Coxihas and Rissoles. Their pastries are always old and or microwaved over and over again. The outer layer is inedible and hard. I love all the other locations, south SF, and in the Castro, not sure why they are ok with this at the North Beach location."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Crapes were not good. The GF tapioca flour was chewy and flavourless. Coffee was bitter, green juice was below average - thick and not flavourful. And açai bawl was also average. Not sure why this place got such high rating. I spent $40 on crapes, coffee, acai bawl and green juice."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I really like this place because of the food, but customer service is not the best.  I would give this place a five if they were friendly."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Best tapioca I’ve had outside of either Brazil or Grandma’s house. Go get the tapioca sertaneja. It will not disappoint!  Obrigado Café de Casa! Tava uma delicia!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cafe de Casa was conveniently located across the street from our hotel in San Francisco.  The first morning, my wife and I ate outside and each had one of their Brazilian crepes.  They were both delicious!  The dark roast coffee pour-overs were outstanding as well:)  The next morning, I walked over and got two coffees and two of their coconut bread pastries (one with cheese and one without) to go.  Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  They were amazing!!  We will definitely return for breakfast next time we visit San Fran:)"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Must stop I had the acai bowel and it was so good and a great way to start the day. The coffee is a must have if you enjoy coffee...I feel good leaving here.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great place to start your day with a delicious breakfast
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Nice and cozy Brazilian cafe. The açaí bowl is a great choice. The cheese bread sandwiches also taste great. I also recommend trying out the coxinha; I found it heavy but it’s very good.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Kind staff that were happy to make adjustments/additions to our order. Cute place, coffee and tea were tasty too. Highly recommend!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great food; interesting cassava / tapioca bread gives a different take on standard brunch menu!  Try their version of dolce de leche (doce de leite)!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Amazing Brazilian cafe! Great coffee and tapioca omelette. The pastries are delightful. It’s so good there was a steady stream of people filling the place.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Açaí bowls. Nice unusual breakfast sandwiches and pastries. Small and packed, some outside seating.  Good coffee."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Great Brazilian food and coffee. No espresso here, only Brazilian coffee."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great coffee amazing food! Legitimate Brazilian menu with fresh ingredients... service could be a bit faster though. Cozy and clean place.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,This was my first time trying an açaí bowl and I was not disappointed! Prices were reasonable and there were copies of the paper to read while eating.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great hot chocolate and coffee! Small and busy cafe but the service and food is great.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Directly across the street from Hotel Caza. The cheese bread breakfast sandwiches are very good. I had the bacon, egg and avocado. My wife and the salmon and cream."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I went here every single morning when I visited San Francisco for a week (our hotel was across the street and didn't provide breakfast). All I can say is.. WOW. I got something different every day and absolutely everything I got was amazing! They also had allergy friendly items if you need it. They got busy but still got everything out in a timely manner. Whatever you get here, I promise you wont be disappointed! Im back across the country and still think about the food here!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Lovely place with good coffee served in the mug (not plastic). The must_try Acai bowl is very good
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"A great find near our hotel with friendly staff and delicious food! The menu is a mix of sweet and savory options. We split a ham and cheese cheese bread sandwich and a couple of the tapiocas crepes, one with beef and one with chicken. Amazing flavors and textures and plenty of food. Finished off with delicious iced coffee. I've added it to my Google Favorites so I can come back next time in the city."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Ate lunch here while visiting San Francisco.  The food and the experience were great.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I fell in love with this place over 3 yrs ago thanks to my then bf. Their baked goods specifically esfirra de frango (my favorite) , acai cups & bowls, and their pineapple & mint drink are absolutely delicious. Unfortunately,  I don't live in the city anymore and it'll so awesome to have them open a store in Tracy someday."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"A small cafe with delicious breakfast selection. The Açai cup & bowl are fresh and plentiful! Breakfast sandwiches are simple but tasty. Brazilian coffee blends are perfect! The staff is friendly and helpful. A great place to start your day if you're looking for healthy, fresh food."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,I grew up in Brazil and this is authentic delicious Brazilian food! The tapioca crepes are a must and you can't go wrong with the filled cheesebreads. Best açaí bowls for sure!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Outstanding açaí bowl and green juice!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great breakfast food. Tasty juices and coffee
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,I’m in San Francisco for the rest of the week and decided to come here for breakfast today (10/13/22). I ordered the green juice and the cheese bread sandwich with salmon and Brazilian cream cheese. The sandwich was TERRIBLE! The salmon was wayyyyyy to salty!!!!! I don’t recommend that item at all.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Love the Acai, the coffee is nothing special"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Lovely little cafe, and the food was really solid. I got an egg sandwich, veggie empada, and the carrot cake which were all good. The staff were very nice, and it was so great to hear people speaking Portuguese. Highly recommend"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The dishes are fantastic!  We had the salads and crepes.  Fruits are fresh and sweet, bringing you memories of summer on a cool winter day.  Crepes have very interesting and chewy texture since tapioca flour are used.  Flavors are perfect if you enjoy that tropical combination of acidity and fruit-forward sweetness."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Very delicious Brazilian place to rat in the morning or during lunch time  :)
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"The tapioca crepes were really good. I had never had one before, and it was incredibly good."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Had the best chocolate coffee I've ever had, and that's basically the only way I drink my coffee. We also had a Nutella and Strawberry crepe and some stuffed pasty sandwich things... Omg ... Everything was excellent. You cannot go wrong here! It's a must go place!!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"It surprised me how good it was. Hard to describe, but you will be surprised. Got the chicken Brazilian cream cheese sandwich and empanada"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,What a wonderful find! The pastries were warm and delicious and the cheese bread sandwich was amazing and very filling. Just happened to stumble upon it and was so worth it. Very reasonably priced. Gabriel was so helpful and very sweet to us. He brought us a free pastry. Please check this place out!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Acai bowl and fresh squeezed OJ! Delicious food from an adorable cafe
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Beautiful hole in the wall.  Great home made Brazilian baked goods and Acai bowls. Coffee was delicious. Quaint, cute, and reserved good place to get some work done and enjoy watching the people walk by."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Everything is so tasty! Highly recommended
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"All of their coffees are pour overs. The coffee was excellent. They also serve hearty Brazilian pastries and crepes that looked delicious, although i didn't try any on this trip.  The guy working the cash register was awesome. Very friendly and seemed truly passionate about his job. He answered the questions we asked with enthusiasm and provided suggestions. We heard him use the same enthusiasm with another group in regard to the pastries as he'd had with us talking about the coffee."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Fantastic food, most of it gluten free.  The cheese rolls are wonderful, the ham and cheese crepes are top-notch, the coffee with milk is excellent and their pineapple and mint smoothie is a must-try.  Its a shame I was only visiting town, or I'd be a regular."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Definitely a recommend. Food is awesome, and all ingredients are freshly prepared. Açaí bowl is really, really good. Definitely worth a trip to try. Staff are really helpful and kind as well. Places to sit outside and inside."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Almost all options on the menu are gluten free making our daughter very happy. Excellent breakfast, thank you!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Amazing pour over coffee from fresh ground beans. They make it really strong, which is just what you need to survive the sea of tourists outside the door. Everyone working there was Brazilian, and they were speaking Portuguese with several customers, which suggests to me that this place serves as a hub for their community. I like that. Good coffee. Good people. This place rules."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,I almost want to give a one star horrible review so that this place doesn't get longer lines and/or sell out of delicious coconut cheese bread and other amazingly tasty delights. I spent $50 on food for myself which divided into breakfast lunch snack dinner- I'm a little piggy!!!!! I really can't say there's anything bad I could say about anything involving this place.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Went here for a quick recharge and this place is a gem. Very Brazilian if you are looking for something different. I ordered a guarana, which is a soda similar to ginger ale. Also ordered a coxinha with a fried empanada. The coxinha is sort of a fried croquet, while the empanada is similar to a chicken pie. Excellent place and staff was nice and Friendly."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Go here all the time during my lunch break, friendly staff, nice wifi, and nice atmosphere. Good coffee, great breakfast and lunch food. Love their savory crepes! Savory pastries are also great as a quick snack and fairly priced. Can be crowded around lunch, but overall worth it."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I’m a Brazilian obsessed for acai and this is the best acai bowl I’ve ever had in the US!! I’ve tried to find a place like this for 11 years in SF and in other states like NY, Hawaii, Florida. Café da Casa acai bowl is the only one that compares to the great acai from Brazil with super high quality ingredients and real taste of acai. Their cheese bread is also awesome so as their carrot cake. Their tapiocas crepes are very original too. I highly recommend this place 😊 this is a must to try"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cafe de Casa has THE BEST, MOST DELICIOUS acai bowl I've had since Hawaii. Every morsel you taste is scrumptious!! So far, we've been visiting for 2 days, and both days has seen breakfast here. We've also tried the pressed French loaf with butter; the pressed French loaf with ham and cheese; the Brazilian cream cheese roll; the ham & cheese on a cheesy roll. All delicious!!! The acai bowls rule the roost, however. Each one lovingly hand crafted to order by the wonderful staff. The acai is perfectly chilled and goes wonderfully with the fresh fruit! I can't wait until tomorrow to have another!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Haven’t had Brazilian food before so I didn’t know what to expect, or have a reference. What I can say is that everything I’ve eaten here felt freshly made, delicious and flavorful. Try all the stuff, including those pastries they have on display! It’s really sweet cozy spot to sit at as well, and they have a few cute tables outside."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Very nice, fresh Brazilian food. I went during lunch so there was a steady stream of customers but not overly crowded. Service was slow. My salad took almost 25 min to prepare, and since the prep station is in site I could see just how slowly the knife was moving."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious Brazilian food! Came here as a recommendation from a Brazilian bartender in Berkeley, and she gave me a great suggestion, as I was impressed by the incredible salgado (savory crepe) I had."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Food was so good. 2 min walk from hotel. Fast and friendly. Get their açaí bowl!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Phenomenal and unique Brazilian breakfast.  Their pastries are excellent and the gluten free omelet was outstanding.  Açaí Bowl; spot on!  Well done in every way and really great ambiance.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Very busy. Prices were typical for that area.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Such an adorable spot to get Brazilian street food and coffee! 😍 The Acai bowls are huge and they gluten free granola. They also have Brazilian tapioca crepes that are absolutely delicious. You can have it sweet or savory. The coffee is also amazing. #glutenfree #vegan
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Probably one of the best Acai bowls in SF.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Great place , simple & cozy Brazilian/American breakfast yet tasty and the best service you can get in SF. Great people managing and attending . A must try!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Wow! The staff here was impressive, they have a cute selfish wall. The coffee is ground and brewed before your eyes. The hand pies are so tasty. This place is absolutely necessary to visit as you enjoy the city. At the bottom of Leavenworth. There is even a cute little park to enjoy. I can't wait to return."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Awesome food and coffee! Some locals monopolized the tables outside but otherwise comfortable.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,A fantastic coffee shop. Had a delicious pour over Brazilian dark roast. Worth checking out!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Amazing little cafe and great service. All the items on their menu look delicious. I’ve tried a bunch of different things and didn’t get disappointed with any of them. All fresh and tasty. I would definitely recommend the Coxinhas, Coconut Bread with Cheese, Kibe with Cheese, Carrot Cake, Guaraná drink, Pao com Ovo."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Such a beautiful place with delicious food!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Love this tiny, awesome Brazilian restaurant! We went there on a Saturday afternoon. It was crowded but within 10 minutes we found a place to sit. We ordered Pitaya bowl and Coconut Acai bowl. My husband and I really liked the Pitaya bowl. The portions look small but are really filling. We paid $30 for both the bowls but I think it was worth the amount because of the freshness of the cut fruits and the unique food!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,We found this cafe in our search of a place serving açaí bowls. The bowls were really yummy and this place is definitely a go-to place if you’re looking for a healthier breakfast. The coffee was really good too!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Must try the cheese bread sandwiches. They melt in your mouth. Specifically the fried egg, avocado, and bacon cheese bread sandwich."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Love this cafe! Must try the enroladinho de queijo (coconut bread with mozzarella cheese) it’s delicious 😋 Also they have great açaí and the staff is very friendly! …
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Such a nice cafe! We enjoyed iced tea and several of these coconut bread buns. So good! Salads also looked amazing! Would come here again. Free WiFi and nice seating outside.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Lovely corner coffee shop with amazing pour over coffee and Brazilian fare - all very well done. The ladies bring the counter clearly care and deliver a great service, in a friendly clean location, with excellent Brazilian good and coffee. Recommended!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Fun place to explore Brazilian street food and great coffee. We stopped in for a light lunch and fell on a lovely salad. Mango and other tropical fruit with fresh greens. Hours aren't posted and website claims it's closed on Sunday, but they were open. Check them out."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Delicious breakfast items, lovely service, outdoors seating, reasonable prices. perfect."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"WoW... what a wonderful Breakfast we had. Very beautiful and very healthy. And the price is absolutly fair. Good price for fresh fruit. We got an Açai ... a cup, like a kind of frozen yoghurt with fresh fruits and Goji berries, homemade guarana .... and fresh orange juice by the side ,... Coffee was also perfekt... you'll miss it, if you don't try.... thank you for this start in our morning!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Stumbled into this place that serves some of the Brazilian favorite breafast and snacks food. Food was great.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,The place was pretty and all. But the quantity of the food was pretty less. It was more like a snack than a meal. Also I was not a fan of the tapioca crepes.  Afterward we went to Sweet Crepes and the difference was huge.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Tapiocas pancakes are tasteless. Smoothie is good. Sandwiches are great! Green juice is not a juice, it’s smoothie as well. Surprisingly cheap."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Very convenient location to our hotel, Courtyard by Marriott Fisherman's Wharf. Lot of choice for breakfast."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great healthy breakfast and lunch options!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great coffee and chicken cheese balls? Excellent if I could give 10 stars I would
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Just walked out of this cafe without goods and unsatisfactory service. Order a  coffee and pastry all ready on the counter. Servers hanging around inside the prep area as if there’s nothing to do. When complaint, cashier prompted  came to me with an attitude saying here it is your money back. What? I’m Brazilian myself and know how things can be overwhelming when prompted customer service is requested. Get your team trained, this is not Brazil."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Terrific pastries. A dangerous place for me.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Been here for breakfast twice now and haven't been disappointed. Their sertanejo crepe is amazing and açaí so fresh! As a Brazilian I felt right back at home.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Loved the food, coffee and the vibe. I’m visiting from Denver but would go here every day of the year if I could. Definitely check it out if you’re in the area!!!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Have to agree with other reviews - the care and presentation is first - rate. I had the egg, ham and cheese crepe, with fruit on the side, and it was delicious. Staff is friendly and helpful as well."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Excellent, authentic food choices! Delicious gluten-free cheese rolls."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Super delicious acai bowl!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great breakfast selection and healthy too!  Definitely recommend!!! Thank you!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"So glad this came up on ""best"" searches! We ordered the frango and abraçadinho, both were top-notch. Unfortunately there's no timer or marker for your food (they bring it to you but it could take a bit depending on crowd) and they could definitely use some more seating area. But their Brazilian radio plays unique indie and alternative music, which makes me happy, and the staff is incredibly friendly."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Stopped by this morning. Very clean, great service, and a huge selection. I wanted to try all the pastries. The coffee was show-stopping. I will definitely be back!"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Food was tasty and presented very nicely. However, we went there for breakfast and it almost became lunch! The staff looked very lost and untrained, and there were moments when 3 staff members stood there in shock not knowing what to do with the orders. Waited over 25 mins for 3 crepes"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Great coffee, pastry, and gluten free breakfast options.  Friendly service too"
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Gluten free tapioca crepe with beef was very good. I would recommend to people who eat Paleo - order without the cheese. The staff who works there are amazing and very helpful.

Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Really nice place. Smoth and clean with a very nice brazilian music. It has brazilian cakes like ""pão de queijo"" (cheese bread). The coffe is very good quality and really tasty. Just one point down for not having expresso."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Everything about this adorable cafe is wonderful – the food, coffee, juices, people, atmosphere. They are so kind! And the cafe com chocolate is the best I’ve ever had."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Bathroom is generous and clean.  At $4.00 a large cup of coffee is a little steep. $2.00 for a can of coke seems a bit high as well. I could not afford to buy any of the food.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Very BAD SERVICE. Cashier/Order Taker is slow, lost, wasn’t able to explain the menu to the customer in front of me or help her decide what to order. The owner (Amanda) was very RUDE, like ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE, ARROGANT. Treated customer as if she WAS DOING ME A FAVOR and DIDN’T NEED MY BUSINESS AT ALL. ***WILL NEVER STEP INTO THAT PLACE AGAIN***. Will share my bad experience with anyone who asks me."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"I’m a native Brazilian and I’ve lived in the USA for a while now. I’ve searched all over the country for a good Brazilian bakery, and I think I’ve finally found it! Nice job guys, will be coming back many times in the near future."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Great coffee and food. Indoor and Outdoor seating.
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Really nice people. Great coffee! I believe they are Brazilian. They brew the coffee differently. Acai bowls are awesome as well

Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,"Cozy little café, but can be a bit stuffy inside. Outside seating in the pavement. The crêpe is good but not so filling and at 13 USD is probably a bit over-priced for what you get."
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Hands down some of the best breakfast we have ever had! Pricey - but you get what you pay for!
Cafe de Casa,2701 Leavenworth St,Why wait in line for expensive standard fare nearby????? .A great little gem in the fishermans warf area across from the Holiday Inn.
