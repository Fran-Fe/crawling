Fayes,3614 18th St,"I love Fayes I go almost once a week (if not more). They are super friendly and their drinks and pastries are great. I recommend the mocha or any of their cold brews, which I've tried all of and love them all. They are dog friendly and if you bring your pup the baristas will throw them a treat. Best coffee shop in the mission!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"A bit underwhelmed with the coffee here. The chai latte was initially spicy, but quickly evolved into flavored milk. I ordered a couple other specialty drinks and wasn't particularly fond of either. Overall, disappointing given the consistent 5 star reviews."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Faye's is a true neighborhood coffee shop plus. They've been around for 25 years & the owners are boss. They stayed open in our otherwise shut down neighborhood, during the pandemic."
Fayes,3614 18th St,It's a quaint little shop love that they have a wide selection of movies and coffee plus love the snacks! ❤️
Fayes,3614 18th St,"We come here every morning and it is the best way to start the day!! The coffee is divine, the pastries are tasty and the staff is great. We love this place!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,My friend introduced me to this place and recommended me to try the ice coffee. I am glad I did. I recommend you to give this place a try. Oh yeah... and you can rent videos here to 🤓 …
Fayes,3614 18th St,This is the absolute best iced coffee in San Francisco.  Run don’t walk to Fayes.   The shop is also a pillar of the community so it’s worth supporting a business that exemplifies the ideals of America!!!
Fayes,3614 18th St,I'm usually picky about coffee but this one sure did live up to the reviews and recommendations. The coffee shop is also super cute! I had a mocha with 3 shots of espresso and it was great! Really strong coffee to get you going for the day. Perfect place to grab a coffee and go to the Dolores park on a weekend.
Fayes,3614 18th St,"They have permanent mask mandates and antagonize those who don't wear them. As the sign tells me to ""move on"", I'm glad to take my business to big corporations without mandates such as Starbucks, Peets, Philz, and Nespresso. If they have immunocompromized staff here was there any masks and social distancing here before 2020? How did they mask sure they didn't get sick from the millions of viruses, diseases, and infections outside of their house especially when they can never be as sterile as a hospital? What happens if those staff members get infected with covid anyways?"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Started coming to Fayes a week ago and it is already my favourite coffee shop in the city. Really friendly, sweet space. Double espresso is delicious. They welcome everyone and there are always sweet dogs in the queue. Great covid precautions - felt completely safe the whole time."
Fayes,3614 18th St,Outstanding spot for cards and pins. Coffee is good too :)
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Everyone moves to a neighborhood and looks for their coffee shop. The place they go for a good coffee, but most importantly, a place one feels welcome and finds community. That is Fayes, without a doubt. It’s helpful that their Dude York is the best coffee I’ve ever had. I’ve moved away from the mission, but I still stop by Fayes whenever I can."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Creatively decorated, notebooks and sketch notebooks available for purchase but they're probably pricey.  Culture? Not so friendly.  It was overall clean.  Fast service."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"I live in this neighborhood and due to diabetes don’t really go out for specialty coffee drinks, however to evaluate this small neighborhood coffee house there are many pluses  They have delicious coffee great Mochas and yummy pastries. For the most part Michael and Justin are very accommodating and really go outa their way for their customers. Michael displays his art and brings in various other artists so the cafe has a wonderful turnaround of art and artists. Justin is a unique vintage collector and has many vintage items to sell and talk about and has quite a love of felines who can’t love that.  The negatives are they a neighborhood cafe where regulars can get a bit gossipy and sometimes you want to get in and out quickly."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"This place sure is cute. I’ve always wanted to try this place, it’s a local coffee shop with consistently good reviews. Sadly, my coffee was very milky and the milk was burnt and burned my tongue. They re-use/re-steam milk here, which is how you know the coffee is not great unfortunately."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Fayes is as good as it gets! The epitome of neighborly comfort - great team, great coffee, great goodies. Their cold brew is top-notch no-frills deliciousness while perusing featured art from local talent - can't get better than that. Starting the day with Justin and Mike is always a highlight!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"This place is the perfect neighborhood coffee shop. Not much seating, so the regulars who come in typically congregate together and chat, instead of looking at laptops.  Really cute stationary and awesome art, some of which the baristas have created themselves.  The best way to experience this place is by becoming a regular."
Fayes,3614 18th St,Accidentally came across this cafe and had no idea what to order. I got a hot lavender tea (added sugar and honey) and the Almond croissant omg it was sooooooo good!!! I paid around $6 for both things.
Fayes,3614 18th St,"This coffee shop is quirky and cute, great for a grab and go iced coffee. They offer splenda and almond milk which is important to me. Their pastries look amazing all the time. It can be slow in the morning, there's usually only one person working so when there's a line it can be awfully long. They have cute gifts and quirky finds that make fun souvenirs. They don't have a bathroom, there's no seating really, and I doubt there's wifi. It's not that kind of coffee shop. But it's yummy."
Fayes,3614 18th St,Great place with tasty coffee. LOVE their pastries as well. Dude baristas are usually pretty rad but a lot of the ladies that work there are often less than pleasant. I also really love that there is still a place for rentals in the neighborhood as well.
Fayes,3614 18th St,Faye's is such a lifesaver.  They make great espresso drinks (be sure to make yourself a loyalty card and store it in the little drawers to the right of the cashier) and you can pick up a movie too.  Faye's is really a little neighborhood joint.  People are always stopping in to chat with the baristas and I just love the friendly sentiment of the place.
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Fayes is a very welcome Mission establishment, serving the community for well over 25 years. The owner is very kind and lives right upstairs. Has a great window bench for people-watching, and an excellent film collection for borrowing purposes. Check it out!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Small & quaint cafe combined with a mini video store & gift shop. Charming with an old fashioned aesthetic. Haven't tried the coffee yet, but i do enjoy stopping by to browse the video selection & novelty items."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"No-nonsense local coffee joint that also rents videos and sells an assortment of tchotchkes and gifts. Discounts on coffee if you bring your own vessel. If that wasn't enough, they also serve as a drop-off/pick-up point for UPS packages. Easily one of the most important establishments in the neighborhood!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"I'm not really into renting movies but the staff is friendly and the latte I got was REALLY good. If you're in the area and jonesing for coffee, come in here and dodge all the surrounding cafes with their much longer lineups :)"
Fayes,3614 18th St,Best coffee in the city. So flavorful and smooth.  Friendly fun staff and cool artwork.  A neighborhood gem.
Fayes,3614 18th St,"The $1 ""teeny"" coffee must be one of the cheapest coffees available in the city! Soy and almond milk are available to add in the refrigerator next to the sweeteners, which is an added bonus."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Great coffee, and they guy at the counter calls everyone ""Buddy"". Haha...   Great if you want some coffee after going to Bi-Rite ice cream just down the street too."
Fayes,3614 18th St,Store is unique cuz it’s also a shop. Coffee is pretty good. Staff seem disengaged from the customers. Didn’t feel homey
Fayes,3614 18th St,The coffee is off the chain.  The ambiance is fantastic.  The locals are friendly.  I’ll be back as often as I can be.
Fayes,3614 18th St,Friendly baristas and lovely curation of gifts and artworks. Very yummy cappuccino at the best price in the neighborhood.
Fayes,3614 18th St,"On Saturday afternoon , we were searching a coffee place with my friends . One girl was working inside . Very bad experience , the girl was disrespectful , she didn’t care about us and didn’t want to help . I don’t recommend at all this place . There is so many places where the people are friendly and happy to help you in San Francisco !!! First bad experience here ."
Fayes,3614 18th St,Cute cafe
Fayes,3614 18th St,"The last of a dying breed.  A local video store with great inventory, knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Oh, did I mention the great espresso?"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Best iced coffee, super cute cards, amazing staff, perfect local spot for coffee, gifts and videos. I adore it."
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Kitschy, locally owned video shop. For when you're too impatient to wait for Netflix. They cut me some slack on my late rental, thanks Molly!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Love this place, but the last 2 times I’ve walked over it’s been closed :( hours aren’t up to date on Google either"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Great little spot for coffee, baked goods and interesting functional art (notebooks, cards, dish towels)"
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Best coffee in the Mission, at the lowest price, and milk bones for the doggos! 🐾❤️ …"
Fayes,3614 18th St,The shop is great.  Mike can not be nicer. Always gracious and a pleasure to do business with.
Fayes,3614 18th St,Great coffee; great videos; great cards; great staff.  What's not to like?
Fayes,3614 18th St,I'm so grateful to have  Faye's Video just 3 blocks away!
Fayes,3614 18th St,Nice coffee and nice people
Fayes,3614 18th St,The terrible service by the rude girl at the counter coupled with the absolutely terrible chai she served me make this a place I will never go back to again. Avoid at all costs
Fayes,3614 18th St,A mixed coffee shop and video rental with a good old school vibe.
Fayes,3614 18th St,Really strong drip served in a eclectic store
Fayes,3614 18th St,I love this Place Amazing Art and Amazing People! @christinearia
Fayes,3614 18th St,"This review is for the coffee, which is quite good!"
Fayes,3614 18th St,Good-enough espresso. No bathroom.
Fayes,3614 18th St,Rude staff
Fayes,3614 18th St,Film + Coffee = More Film
Fayes,3614 18th St,So cute
Fayes,3614 18th St,Great 👍 …
Fayes,3614 18th St,"Tasty coffee, nice service."
Fayes,3614 18th St,The best local coffee
Fayes,3614 18th St,Lovely coffee stop
Fayes,3614 18th St,Love. Love. Love this place!
Fayes,3614 18th St,Kinda burnt
Fayes,3614 18th St,"A cafe located in San Francisco, USA. Located near Mission Street. As you pass by, you don't know if it's a cafe or a record shop. Across the street is Tartine Bakery and Pizzeria Delfina.  Something like a record shop is actually a DVD, connecting people in the neighborhood by selling coffee and renting out DVDs? It feels like this. Coffee is sourced from McLaughlin Coffee Roasters in Emeryville, Bay. The coffee itself is medium-roasted, so people who like steamy taste won't like it. However, because of the cafe's leisure and generous atmosphere, I feel that this is San Francisco.  ""Neighbors don't let neighbors get deported"" engraved on the coffee makes you feel the soul of San Francisco. A good place to buy a cup of coffee and feel the diversity of America in Dolores Park."
Fayes,3614 18th St,Great shop! They serve a REAL Chai latte (spicy) and a great Iced coffee! The trinkets and books are full of humor! We loved it!
