Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Delicious, reasonable pricing (for SF), peaceful, clean and cozy environment.  They accommodated my dietary restrictions which shows a level of care rare to find in today’s world!  They don’t make spinach salads, but custom made a spinach and orange vine grate side salad to go with my portobello sandwich, since I despise lettuce and spring mix. Additionally, I asked to sub bell peppers for cucumber and the cashier ran back to the kitchen to notify them! No extra charge for the substitutions, by the way. The service is phenomenal.  To find a delicious sandwich AND side salad for $15 in a clean, cozy shop in a great location is incredible. We had a blast people watching and enjoying the city sounds and sites through the windows too :)"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Poor service and food was adequate at best. Honestly I ate better in Army dining halls. Asked specifically for hash browns and they brought some horrible pan fried potatoes with no condiments. When I went inside and asked for salt, pepper and anything to add some taste to the sorry mess they brought ketchup! Then the manager had the nerve to ask me if anything was wrong. One piece of toast with a single small pat of butter. Absolutely no refills of a cup of brewed coffee? We can bring you one but you have to pay for it before you leave?🙄#wontbeback"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,A very nice place to grab breakfast or lunch. The crepes were delicious! Fruit was fresh and juicy. Staff is super friendly and accommodating!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,A gem of the city- diner feels with a full variety menu. Incredibly kind and hard working staff. Hard to find places like this these days
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Never considered going in here until I was looking for power. I lived in this neighborhood for 4 years and SF for 8 years. I am 100% a potential customer.  Me and my coworkers just looking for somewhere to get power. Despite having ample power, after plugging in we were told they do not offer power.  We found The Bean Bag because we were looking for power. Lots of reviews that say they offer power.  I strongly dislike rules like this, especially when they don’t make sense. So congratulations, you have made the “never going back list!” 🏆"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,The staff was so nice to me and my smoothie was so good! Would 100% recommend for a fun drink and food.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,+ lots of vegan/vegetarian options + falafel burrito bowl was delicious and filling - no free coffee refills
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,The Jamaican crepe was incredible. Filled with banana and caramel and coconut sauce. I’ll be back and bringing my family!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Food is way more expensive than it's worth. $5 dollars for a mediocre taco, and when I ordered it they did not honor the happy hour deal for a beer and charged me $7 for one instead of the advertised $4. Way better food throughout SF and much cheaper beer."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"First time here and i will say i am coming back regularly. The service was top-notch, kuddos to the gentleman at the cashier, well mannered and dished out drinks in quick fashion. What’s most notable about this place is the warm and comfortable tone you get while eating here, not to mention the food is simply put amazing. If you have any doubts about coming to try this place out i assure you, you wont be dissatisfied."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"One of my favorite spots in the city. Food and coffee are great,  but the service and ppl are the greatest. I like the red smoothie, burrito, iced coffee, chilaquiles, and falafel tacos but truly you can’t go wrong."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Really good breakfast place with great vegetarian options
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Good customer service! Polite and friendly staff. Tried their Chagachino and was great!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Outstanding customer service. Never been here before. I called in to see if they had blended coffee drinks, akin to a Starbucks Frappuccino.  The young lady I spoke with said they didn’t but that she’d be willing to make the drink for me.  I showed up and not only did she try, but she seemed happy to do so. And to go above and beyond she offered to give me the left overs  from the blender which was like another 8 ounces of drink, or to make me something else if I didn’t like it.  That’s how to do business. Even though her attempt at the mocha Frappé didn’t hit my pallet the way I would have liked, I truly appreciated the gesture.  As far as the atmosphere of the café, vibes were calm and casual. No music blaring in the background. Plus the art on the walls and the wooden furniture gave the café a warm and homey feel.  Thank you young lady for your hospitality, I hope future customers receive the warm reception you showed me.  All the best and cheers to your next local discovery."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"So I will say, at first I ordered 2 mochas but the server gave us Hot Chocolate’s. We then approached her about changing our drink and she was more than happy to do so. In fact, she kept the Hot Chocolate and added like 2 espresso shots to it, which made for one of the best Mochas I’d ever had. Like why tf doesn’t everyone do this? It tasted so good. Anyway, the customer service was great and the coffee was even better. Lots of food options as well. The vibe inside was great too. It’s in a great location being that it’s right next to a park. I would highly recommend for some food or just some coffee."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great breakfast spot with the best Iced Mochas! I would recommend for sure and they are friendly!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Delicious food and coffee. Friendly: blended protein powder I had into their smoothies. Customized food orders.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great place to grab a coffee/beer, work remotely, and/or have a bite. Outdoor seating and love it here!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Nice little place! Had a breve latte 👌
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This place is so warm and friendly. An amazing spot for anything you might want. Would love to visit everyday I cannot recommend it enough. Fair prices, friendly faces, good food"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Excellent restaurant with large choice of soft drinks, hot or cold, perfect for breakfast or coffee. I do recommend !"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Very hip, good energy cafe on divisdero and hayes. Mostly calm throughout the week and more upbeat during Fridays. The staff is very friendly and accommodating 🙏"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Such a nice spot. Amazing sandwiches, lots on tap, coffee, breakfast, all amazing. Service is always spectacular."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,My cappuccino was full of coffee grounds and coarse ones. They used coarse coffee grounds for making espresso. 🤦‍♂️  It's a cafe and not a coffee shop. Coffee products are just another item on the menu of things they sell. I wouldnt buy any espresso drinks from here.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"first visit - Loved the mocha, but will go there again to try other things  Second visit - ordered the jaguar savory crepe, loved it, it was delicious with the salad on the side. Also tried chagacino, oh I loved it ❤️. The person behind the counter was the most elegant barista I had ever met. She was playing some Parisian vibes jazz which went so great with the rainy weather today. I really felt like I was sitting in a cafe in Paris, and she had that foreign accent or way of speaking or something which made me feel so welcomed there. Loved this experience.  Visit #3: Thai iced tea was good, just as you would expect it."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,The huevos rancheros were outrageous. Would definitely come back!  Also their playlist is full of bops 👏
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Good menu options. The hamburger is great and the steak fries are the best. Amble seating, kind service, and easygoing overall."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Good coffee place with great choice of plates. I had the Special Salmon and it was delicious and a very good amount of food ! we recommend this place !
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"It’s been 12 years, still great!  I first visited this place 12 years ago and it was amazing then both early and later in the evening. It was the launching point of many a great night.  I’ve return all this time later nervous that it would have changed beyond recognition. THANKFULLY not it’s great.  Staff were amazing and super friendly, food was delicious and quick. Drinks (non-alcoholic) were beyond amazing. Sadly I didn’t get a chance to reminisce with some beers in the evening. Maybe next time."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,TACOS TACOS TACOS. Strongly encourage the owners to go all-in on the new tacos concept menu add. Honestly some of the best I have had. Will be back as often as I can before I need to queue for a long time for the beauties.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Amazing SF institution. Get the breakfast burrito or tacos. Owner is hella friendly. This place just vibes.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"We visited this place at first time and got a warm welcome from a service! So friendly person! Thanks mate! ;) He introduced a menu and suggested choices for a late lunch! Amazing service!!  Huge cup of coffee latte! It's not easy to find a tasty coffee in LA, but this place has it! Definitely a like! Chicken toast was delicious as well! The host understood that we were gonna share it and proposed it!  The last but not least, the host gave us a warm bye-bye words! Overall, the place has exceptional workers + delicious food! I would definitely go there again!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Cool place, really nice staff and the food plus coffee was good and affordable."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great environment of business professionals, college students, and skateboarders alike. Good beers on tap and excellent mimosas for those mornings you need a little extra help waking up."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"My favorite cafe in SF for working. Excellent food & coffee: try the specialty tacos, burgers, crepes, breakfast sandwich, breve latte….honestly it’s all great. Accessible electrical outlets, good wifi, dogs allowed, relaxed atmosphere, clean restrooms. They don’t bat an eye if you sit there all day nursing a single black coffee (but of course you should buy stuff!). Above all, the owner and staff are relentlessly friendly and accommodating."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"As I read a book at Bean Bag, my new favorite cafe , I overhear a conversation;  a young woman aghast at her friend’s sipping hot chocolate through a straw: “ hey I don’t mean to judge you but I am going to judge you - but this is really ridiculous”; Divisadero street has easy bonhomie and Ben Bag is its best cafe ; exterior is light olive green with a mural of a Greek goddess greeting you with mixture of intrigue and shyness ; the four dollar draft beer during happy hour is a great deal. The soundtrack today is Brazilian samba."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Food is actually really great, and the staff is friendly at first. Then they all turn crazy when you ask for the wifi code.  Last time, I ate my meal, then asked for the code. But they said they couldn't prove I had a meal, so no wifi for you!  Today (a Friday), this sign was out. We asked for a wifi code as soon as we ordered two meals. They said there's no wifi. I pointed to the sign. They said there's no wifi on weekends. I reminded them that today is Friday. They said Friday is the weekend. We asked them to take the sign down or flip it to the ""try our nopales"" side. They said they wanted to keep it up. No wifi for you!  Done ever trying to work here (and spend my money here) again."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Food was great. Server was very nice and welcoming.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great food and the people who work there are the best. One of my SF favorites!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Love the vibe. Nice outdoor seating. Nice varied menu.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This place is awesome if not for the simple fact that they literally have something for everyone!! Been here on my last two trips to SF.  Both times I’ve had one of their bagels sandwiches.  Let me tell you, I have no idea how they get the bagel to be so soft and warm.  Perfect!! They have tacos and burritos and crepes and a bunch of other things. Great for that large party where you have to satisfy different wants"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Came to this place to have some coffee and it was really bad. I just recommend you to go there to eat as they have a really varied menu, you can also go there and work with your laptop.  Depending on the hour you arrive, you might find a line to order so, prepare to wait."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Friendly and good food.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Some people love it and it's an absolute paragon of the neighborhood. I didn't really enjoy my breakfast sandwich, just tasted so plain and boring which might be on me. The coffee was good dinner variety coffee, very darkly roasted."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"The Bean Bag Cafè is one of those places that have something for everyone. From pastries, to salads, to sandwiches, I have yet to be disappointed by their food. The interior is interesting with lots of art on the walls and definitely has a homey feel to it. Staff has always been patient and food out out fairly quickly, even when they are busy. I had a scramle once there that was delicious. I can't remember the name of it, but it had chicken and potatoes. Tasted marvelous and came out quick! Their chicken sandwich is good too."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"I live in the neighborhood so I always go here. The staff are always very courteous and friendly. They seem to really like what they do. The food is great and the portions are just right. If you have a smaller appetite, two people can share a plate of anything on the menu. I like their savory crepes the best."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,You have to try the tacos. Best in SF.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,One of my favorite San Franciscan neighborhood cafes. Staff is super friendly and food pretty decent with lots of healthy options. Love their Benedicts. Most of the stuff here are verysonable prices by SF standard. It also has free WiFi and you can bring a book or laptop to sit for a few hours. Bean bag cafe gives the neighborhood a bit more human community feel than just some high-end overpriced restaurants which NOPA is increasing developing into.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"We ordered 4 drinks and not one of them was hot, they were warm at best. Really disappointed ☹️."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Delicious breakfast, so many options and very well done! And the service was fast and very friendly. Perfect for a brunch with friends or by yourself"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Good atmosphere! Had a California sandwich w fresh mix. Liked it a lot!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great neighborhood cafe with a wide selection of food
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great food and service. The folks there are very friendly. We ate breakfast here a few times during our trip to San Francisco. The only disappointment was that they ran out of decaf coffee one morning. Still, we would go back."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great atmosphere. Wonderful people who work at the establishment, they put so much love and passion into their work; that goes for both the waiters/waitresses and the cooks. The best burgers I’ve ever had came from this place, so obviously I would recommend that. Drinks are great, food is amazing, and the people are spectacular."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great food, ambiance, and 3 dollar draft beer from 3-10pm, daily..."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Very friendly & nice staff! It's pretty busy, but they do well it's getting you your order quickly! It's pricey, but their burrito is really good, too! I got the al pastor, and I loved it!  The burrito is pretty big, so it's worth the price, only a few bucks more than everybody else's burritos, and I think way better! The tacos are pretty good, too; and speaking of two, be sure to order two so you can get the happy hour price on beer, as ordering one doesn't cut it, for some reason.  They've usually got a pretty good selection of beers on tap, for only three bucks (during happy hour, $4.50 otherwise) with food purchase (of anything, or two tacos). Indoor and outdoor seating are both available, but the outdoor seating is right on the sidewalk, and the sidewalks about 3 in wide! Luckily, Shared Spaces SF has just been made permanent, so their parklet seating should be there, as well!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"The food is delicious and comes out really quick, the service was also very caring. For drinks we got coffee and a smoothie both were great. Will definitely come back in the future."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great coffee and really good food. Their crepes are also interesting and unusual combinations- I had the citron and it was delicious. The ambience and service were also excellent.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,20 min wait and 3 requests to bus the table so I can sit after ordering food.  No WiFi on the weekend.  Mediocre food and coffee.  Also the food is expensive for a dive cafe - same price for breakfast plates as any good restaurants in town - $16-$19 for a plates.  Zero ambience.  Better skip…plenty of other options in the hood and beyond.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Absolutely loved the crepes I got here.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,My food arrived very quickly. The portions are extravagant. This is so far my favorite place in SF to chill and grab a quick bite. Definitely recommend!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great friendly people, terrific food. Rancho huevo   plate was delicious, good coffee as well. This was our go-to spot for breakfast while in San Francisco."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Top quality food, service and everything!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Don't bother if you want to order ahead.  I ordered three tacos on GrubHub to be picked up. I arrived at the pick up time and the food wasn't ready. They said 10 minutes. Okay. After ten minutes, it was going to take ten more minutes. I leave, come back, and they give me two cold tacos. I say that I ordered three tacos, and they say, well, it's the app's fault. Okay, how should I order ahead then? They say that since I came in twice, I obviously have the time to come in person and wait.  Not great."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Very tasty sweet Hayes (peach and papaya) and fried tofu.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Very good pasta. Loved it. 12.5$ + tax.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"The cafe had a European vibe. Their egg sandwich and hot cocoa were my perfect evening snack. An artist, @moseenmomade, painted the cafe while we were having our food. The experiemce was surreal"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Sorry for being rude about their coffee really loudly. It was nice coffee really.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Awesome place for crepes and breakfast fare. Chill vibe and friendly servers add to an overall excellent experience. I especially love the smoked salmon crepe, and the perfectly crispy home fries were a revelation. I live close by so I generally order takeout, but there are usually enough seats to dine in with no hassle. Good stuff!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great neighborhood spot for breakfast and lunch. Great menue!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Portobello mushroom sandwich with the best potatoes ever! Excellent service and food
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Some of the best food in San Francisco and definitely the best atmosphere. I moved away 20 years a go and still talk about them. Wife and I just went back and the owner is still there, like he is every morning and without missing a beat says to me "" it's been a while, Jason, good to see you."" If you get the chance check it out.  Driver J"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great place to stop in solo or with a friend and have a light meal, snack, or beverage of your choosing (coffee, smoothies, beer, lots of choices). Lots of seating inside or outside. Right off Divisadero & Hayes which are high car and foot traffic so not the best spot for heart to hearts or sensitive ""it's not you, it's me""  conversations. 😉"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This place became somewhat of a local for our breakfast when staying in SF last month. Great food, either cooked breakfasts (the breakfast potato is delicious) our the very good granola and fruit with a very generous fruit serving. Coffee is nothing to get too excited about but it served its purpose and was by no means a let down. Staff were efficient more than they were friendly - but it’s a very busy little place so that’s forgivable. I liked the window seats - great people watching over breakfast!  Also free wifi is an obvious draw card lots of people tapping away on laptops and devices over their meals / drinks."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great wholesome breakfast with nice staff.  Watch locals pass by from corner cafe. Highly recommend 😎 …
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Bought a Chagaccino with oat milk. Turns out they made it with dairy milk. I've been sick since I'm intolerant. This could be really bad in case someone is allergic to dairy.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Lots of vegetarian options in the menu. Ordered a portobello sandwich which was ok but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The staff provided friendly and good service
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"A neighborhood favorite with great happy hour beer specials on a good selection of drafts. They're been focusing on tacos and burritos recently, and while they're not cheap, the quality is top-notch. Try the al pastor."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Many food and beverage options, Wi-Fi and plug points. The barista is quite friendly. I enjoyed the lavender lemonade and parfait (granola, fruits, and yoghurt)."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Took me 3 years of living in the neighborhood to visit bc it's so unassuming, but I was blown away. They're very kind, my chilaquiles and latte were fantastic, and I like the order first setup. Very friendly neighborhood vibes sitting out on the patio, good for puppy watching."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"When I lived across the street, my favorite here if you like tuna was bodega bay and fries! Above average quality food at a corner cafe!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Excellent eggs and other breakfast items!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Be ready to waste at least half an hour for a bagel... our experience was really bad today my hot cholate was 3 quarter cup of foam, my coworker's bagel was dropped on the floor while bagged, no acknowledge or thanks for the extreme wait... all I ordered was a plain bagel witb cream cheese. Nothing too complicated"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,I go here for lunch a couple times a week. Salads and sandwiches are excellent. Staff are friendly. Has a relaxed neighbourhood feel to it. Beer selection is good. Looks like a good place to bring your laptop and work as many people do this.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Always a great hangout in the heart of the cool and chill divis corridor. Great food and beer at reasonable prices
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"No frills type of place.  Decent coffee.  No other coffee spot open as late in the area. Diverse, eclectic crowd."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,I've been going to this place since it's been open. It was a chill spot  for my grandmother and I.  I love the owner and his brother.  Always made me and my daughter feel welcome.  I used to know every employee but the current ones are great as well. Great service and food.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"The neighborhood go to. Chilaquiles, Benedict, or a classic BEC. Can’t go wrong."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Get the Carnitas tacos!! Super friendly. Good prices. The menu is extensive, which can be arresting, so lemme help: always get the homestyle fries, pesto crepe, any taco, or the breakfast burrito. Smoothies here are also 👌 for the park …"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Bustling place with good crepes (savory and sweet) and drinks (smoothies, my fave was ginger lemonade). Quick and friendly service and a nice vibe of art and music. Would come again."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Great, affordable food that came out at a very reasonable speed. They allow dogs inside so we could visit with our dog! Adequate amount of seating and looks like they sold good beer if you fancy a couple of pints!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Excellent breakfast menu, nice coffee, friendly staff"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Healthy foods collection with a large food menu. So many options to choose and customize tastes and flavors. Musical environment, very lovely. I loved the drink options, delicious and healthy juices are available. They have a nice combination of foods with fruit and dishes."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Came here for breakfast/lunch 3 times while visiting San Francisco from the UK. Food and service was excellent and we were always made to feel really welcome. Great atmosphere in a lovely setting, would definitely return here when visiting again!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Went there to do some work on my laptop. Sign said wifi only with a meal. So I bought the meal and then the barista said they weren’t giving any internet codes out regardless. Such a dumb policy and even dumber that they don’t have an accurate sign.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"A great little bar, caff, WiFi zone. The beers were great, the prices were good, the atmosphere was lovely. What more can you expect. I'll bet the food was good too but we just had drinks. Check it out."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"You'll think it's the '00s again!  Your refuge from $9 toast and even better, the people who love $9 toast.  The food is reliable, the staff are sharp and the music is always a surprise. As good for a quick to-go as it is for a sit-and-stay.  Bean Bag Cafe has toast, too."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Great go to local cafe..friendly.. best comfort food/breakfast in NOPA area! ..their tacos are amazing too!
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Bean Bag Cafe is an excellent neighborhood small business! Lots of seating with spacious tables and plenty of food and drink options.  The coffee here is LEGIT - I'm the type of person who drinks 3-4 cups of coffee per day and a large House Blend from here wired me up for the whole day! Not sure if I got an extra-caffeinated batch, though."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Went here to catch up with a group of friends. The vibe was great. Social but not too loud. We grabbed a group of tables in the middle of the cafe and that didn't seem to be an issue.  I ordered the Petaluma sandwich with avocado and a side salad. It was great -- the sandwich was warm but not overly toasted (which I really hate). The salad was generously portioned with a tart balsamic vinaigrette. My friends ordered beer which was decent and according to them fairly cheap.  Knocking one star because the cashiers were needlessly unfriendly when I ordered -- terse questions and little eye contact.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This is ridiculous.. we ordered breakfast burritos an hour ago, were told they would be ready in 25-30 minutes. We arrive after 30 minutes to wait in line another 20+ minutes.. get to the front to pay and they still aren’t ready yet… that’s terrible customer service"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"If you're in the mood for inexpensive beers, this is the place to go. Of course the ambience feels more like that of a coffee shop, seeing as it IS a coffee shop. It's a cute coffee shop though with the right amount of personality. Their breakfast burritos are delicious, large, and perfect hangover cures. They have outdoor seating right on Divis which makes for great people watching and it's always busy, but not too busy."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This place is the cutest. friendly staff, loads of options."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Nice spot for rest and tasty food. We sat outside . . . I gave in and fries with my order.  Indoor seating available.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"I have been a regular here at Bean Bag for over 20 years for good reason. Very friendly staff and a wide variety of quality food from breakfast, lunch to dinner! 🤗"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,The burger there was really tasty. Usually burgers are flavorless and you have to add a ton of catsup or something. This patty had a great flavor.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Nice laid back place with space to eat outside, which I LOVE! Only had the breakfast and the baja caeser salad but both were great! Service is friendly. Decent beer selection."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Nice atmosphere with ample seating. Good food at a decent price, although drink prices on the chalk board were incorrect. Great happy hour with $3 beers from 3-10 PM every day!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Good crepes! Was a little crowded.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,La mancha scramble is great.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"I've been going to the Bean Bag Cafe for more than 14 years and it's great. It is one of the last original businesses on divisedero that is still left. It's real, honest and original. A large coffee is the real large size not the puny little cup the hipster faux fancy places nearby offer, and is $2.75 instead of the ridiculous price over $4 at spyglass (that makes watery crud anyhow) or the Mill. Food is excellent and they serve breakfast lunch and dinner. Some times hard to get a table at brunch. They do have some outside."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Owner charges $4 for black coffee and requires a $15 minimum order for access to the Wi-Fi password. Will take my business across the street to The Mill
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Good strong coffee. Solid breakfast and lunch menu of crepes, burritos, and sandwiches. (I haven't tried dinner yet). Tasty selection of local beers on tap for just $2.50 a pint during happy ""hour"", 3PM til close daily. Fast free WiFi. Lively ample outdoor seating. Clean bathroom. Super friendly owner and staff. Interior just got a facelift with beautiful reclaimed wood countertops while still retaining the original Bean Bag charm."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This place is a class act. The food is an incredible value, it tastes absolutely amazing and the price is not super crazy. The staff is attentive and genuinely concerned about your experience. The only way I won't come here again and again and again is if I die first."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Love this place, great comfort food. Friendly service."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"A well lit corner café, with a full menu of smoothies, breakfast and lunch options. Very enjoyable Atmosphere!"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Love the vibe here. Friendly staff, variety of foods on offer (and beer!), great decor that feels like home."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"This is a great Sunday morning breakfast spot that has surprisingly escaped the San Francisco brunch mafia.  It's often lively, but rarely crowded; there are a few tables outside on the sidewalk european-style and additional seating inside.  The coffee is solid, as are the crepes, which dominate the menu.  Portions here aren't particularly hearty, but that goes with the territory.  Nurse your hangover here--the sunshine will do you good."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Bean bag café has a large menu option. Their orange juices are not freshly pressed so I gave a try to the ginger lemonade. I was very strong in ginger but very tasty.  You can work at the table tops they have a lot of plugs. And the WiFi password is at the bottom of their receipt. The only issue if you'd like to work is that the music is extremely loud (rap and R&B radio on the day I was there)
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"A neighborhood classic with great coffee, a surprisingly large menu and a very friendly staff!"

Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Opted out of Popeyes, deciding on local business.  Ordered a couple of cheeseburgers.  Perfectly cooked, large patty and very tasty!  Large order of fries included.  Will be back for sure."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Maybe we just had a bad experience, but the coffee didn't live up to the hype (ordered latte and it was pretty much all milk, better off going to Peet's). On top of that they forgot about our food order. Bit disappointed, I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast."

Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"Bean Bag has been a staple of mine for nearly 20 yrs of daytrips to SF. Their French toast is excellent,  the house potatoes are my favorite anywhere I've been,  and the casual vibe and comfy couch make it a very laid back place to grab a quick bite. Nothing fancy or pretentious,  just reliably good food."
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,"The wait for food can be long, and the food is good but not great. There were flies around too. That said, it’s good for a chill place to meet a friend for coffee"
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,Waited for 50min for our food. They said they didn't know what happened to it and wouldn't take responsibility for screwing up our order. We asked for a refund for the crepes since we asked for ice cream and we couldn't take the ice cream to go. They refused and said they would give us whipped cream instead. Really unprofessional. Not worth coming back here.
Bean Bag Cafe,601 Divisadero St,This is a great place for breakfast or brunch. If you're lucky you can grab one of the coveted outside seats on a warm morning. The food is reliable and atmosphere is what you would expect from the neighborhood.
