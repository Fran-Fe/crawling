Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Nice coffee place in a an old army building. They have lots of coffee from South America.  Decor was quirky with lots of coffee gear. Very sf.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"I really like it because one of the staffs there actively told me Habibi means sweetheart in Arabic. That was sweet of him. I was wondering what it is. And he explained it all. Of course, I did think of the name as something cute. And “habibi” who wouldn’t like it? It tastes good too. Like flowers. 🪸💐 …"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Hidden coffee house inside of an old army building at Fort Mason. I wouldn't have found them if they weren't located directly outside the off the grid food truck grounds. As their name suggests, they carry many brands and blends from South American and international sources. The coffee is high quality and the vibe is relaxed chill, especially the outside seating on a nice day. Be aware that during peak times, the wait for coffee can run from 10-20 minutes so if you see it full or if there's a line, don't come if you're in a rush. There's a great view of the water and boats which makes this an excellent place to get lost in your thoughts while sipping a latte."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Really good coffee with seasonal specials - gotta try the specials, always really nice. Got a lot of outdoor seating area."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"I absolutely love this coffee place! The coffee is top-notch, and the baristas are always friendly and welcoming, this place is always packed because it’s so good, its worth it to wait because it’s the perfect spot to grab a cup and enjoy Fort Mason afterwards. Highly recommended!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Great new outpost for Equator. The coffees are superb, as you'd expect - very flavorful. Staff are super friendly, and there's some great seating space outdoors. Also some stools inside of you prefer. A great addition to the Fort Mason complex."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"It’s a cool little shop, nice location, accessible, super friendly staff, but my drink of choice, my London Fog was really just so-so. I’d return and try something else though my girlfriend enjoyed her coffee."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Nice little cafe. Also the variety of the different coffee options are pretty good. Regardlessly when I was there it was a Little chaotic. Quite some coffee orders had been totally mixed up although the shop was not really full. I left after 15mins without having received my coffee order since I was so frustrated.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,My go to for breakfast tacos (roosters) and a chocolate shakerato! Baristas are awesome! Make sure to get the chipotle sauce with the tacos.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"So nice to have a delicious equator coffee here now.   I think I feel a lot of coffee breaks coming on now.   Pastries are delicious here too.   Looks like they have healthy snack items but I totally ignored those.   Bonus they offer wine, beer and cocktails.   Yes.  Cocktails!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Do you want to wait 20-30 minutes to get your coffee after you’ve ordered? Do you want to wait until after your food arrived and got cold then you’ll get your coffee? Then come to this location. They really have it figured out. All that wait time and they still got my order wrong.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco- I love coming here on Saturday mornings for an oat milk chai latte! They also make killer breakfast sandwiches. Definitely worth checking out!
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Love Equator coffees, but this location was a bust. They don’t make the drink right and the baristas and cashier seemed to busy with their own affairs vs getting the order right and making an exceptional drink."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Great specialty coffee! Also the baked goods are awesome. Nice staff, clean restroom."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"My favorite San Francisco coffee shop- I ordered my favorite oat milk chai latte! They also make awesome sandwiches for breakfasts and all the meals are great. Sure worth finding out! If you are a coffee lover, you should not miss getting a cup here!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Enjoyed an almond croissant and an ice mocha! The mocha was coffee forward and not heavy on the sugar, which I absolutely loved. The croissant was amazing too! Flaky on the outside, soft and moist on the inside!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Great spot for your morning coffee. I am usually a coffee purist but decided to try orange blossom oat latte and it was a delightful surprise!
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Want a jolt, perhaps after an early morning walk, bike, or run along the marina. Look no further. Equator is the place to go. Just inside the Fort Mason entrance way, grab an espresso (Tigerwalk), pour over (Rwanda Nyampinga), or house blend Kenya Aberdare. A perfect way to start the day. Just awesome!!!"

Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Just another coffee joint in a beautiful location. It was a unique Valentine's Day experience to have the London Fog Charcoal: the presentation was unique and fun, but the flavor .. WORKS ... nothing more, nothing less."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Solid coffee shop with a somewhat unpredictable assortment of food. Pickings are slim towards the end of the day.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"This must be one of the best cup of coffee we have had...A housemade vanilla latte with whole milk was so good, we had to order another one immediately. The 2 staff members there on food truck night (8-16-19) were great and will highly recommend to any coffee lovers. Heck they even sell cans of good beer there. Cool place."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Another coffee shop at the other end of the Marina, directly at the entrance to the Fort Mason Center. Bonus for real cups and for water along with the espresso! Salat was good as well."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,staff is nice but you will wait at least 10 minutes no matter what you order and no matter how long the line is
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Got a macchiato and their breakfast sandwich. Macchiato was pretty good — a bit acidic but good texture and flavor. Breakfast sandwich was superb! Would have it again. Nice location along the water too; perfect for a morning coffee after a walk.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Great coffee. Sometimes this location gets busy, but they open early."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Delicious inexpensive coffee and love that they give you a 25 cent discount if you bring in your own cup! Only reason it's not 5 stars is I went to do some work on my laptop there and it was super cold as they had the door and windows open at 6:30am so I had to leave as my fingers got too cold.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"The mocha brownie is debatably the best brownie I’ve ever eaten! I was very excited for the nitro cold brew. However, it’s $4.00 for a small cup, the only size. The flavor of the coffee was ok."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"This coffee shop has a great atmosphere and is perfect for getting some work done. It's spacious, and clean with lots of space in between tables so you can move around freely. And their coffee tastes so good with a variety of selections of coffee and foods you can choose."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Their drip coffee is divine. Also they’re a B corp! What’s not to love.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"The best coffee shop I’ve been so far! Everything is perfect- coffee, food,service and location! You guys are great!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Marketing ""Hip"" Equator coffees fall short of Four Barrel and others in SF and the espresso drinks are not up to par with Orson's Belly or Andytown, but still, if you're at Fort Mason, this is a good option."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Frittata sandwiches and tacos made a good lunch! Iced Matcha Latte was refreshing and cortado delicious as always.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"I stopped in here for a quick breakfast and coffee, and was impressed by the very friendly and kind staff. Equator has pretty good quality coffee and food, however the food took a very long time to get. They have a very small kitchen area, and especially if it's busy can get backed up, but I wasn't in a hurry, so it didn't make too much difference. I'd stop in here again for something should I be in the area!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,The place is not set up to take multiple orders. Avoid at all costs. Took over 20 min for a hot chocolate. Barista said it's not uncommon to wait 20-40 minutes for drinks on the weekend. Unreal...
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"I'm their fan for the past 5 years: consistently perfect lattes and affogatos deserving full 5 stars and great baked goods for a morning breakfast along Marina Green with SF Bay views. Lately their online ordering is repeatedly down, and that's super-frustrating because the live lines there are horrible, so I really wanted to remove 1 star, but I just can't."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Very slow service - took 20minutes to get a simple coffee.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Superbly crafted coffee with some tasty treats inside.  This is a must stop if in the area. Don't be fooled by other ""local coffee shops"" this place is legit.  Don't take my word for it try them out."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Love the location, the atmosphere, and the drinks. Great meeting place. Community!  Teach your staff to not touch their faces and hair. I'm talking to you kid. [Shudder]"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"My favorite spot to get coffee in the whole city. Grab a drink and sit outside at one of their tables. There is a ton of space and a great view of the bridge. Highly recommend their matcha latte. I’ve yet to find one better than theirs! Also recommend the Early Bird breakfast tacos — SO delicious. And for a gluten-free, vegan treat, get their carrot muffin."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Unique style of coffee brewing.  Worth trying it.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Nice little coffee shop - especially if you like sitting outside and sipping your cuppa. It's great after a bike ride.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Service is the worst. And unfortunately it's not the first time, simply the last drop. Online order was not ready due to system failure (not their fault?) then they mixed up the in-person order, had to redo it and amazingly done it wrong again as I've learned later bringing it home. And through that they didn't bother to apologize and couldn't care less. We've all seen bad days but this is beyond a single accident and it's sad, could have been a nice place."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,I ordered a lavender latte and a muffin to go with it. Lavender latte I got on a friend's recommendation and turns out it's very tasty with a really nice flavor. And the muffin was also pretty delicious too.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"Good coffee but the ordering process is appalling. Online ordering through the app is disabled every time you’d reasonably except to want a coffee (this morning it’s been off between at least 8:30 and 11am). So you get there, wait in ridiculous lines only to realize that the loyalty program only works… in the app 🤦‍♂️ good one. How about adjusting wait times for online orders instead of disabling it when it gets busy, so people can get on with their life rather than having to come in and wait in line? Oh and while they’re prompt to disable online ordering, not so prompt to re-enable it. Countless times have I walked in to no line after peak yet ordering was still not back."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"There’s generally a bit of a wait on the weekend due to both tourists and locals converging here, but the coffee is great and staff always very nice. I recommend you try the cashew milk!"
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,A perfect Latte for a perfect Marina Day!!  Equator is a classic stop.  Delightful service.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Delicious coffee. Excellent service. Staff was very friendly to my children.
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,"This is great coffee, but they have totally lost track of the ordering process. 15min wait for a coffee order? That’s fine. But being told 15 and then taking 30min?? Come on. Manage your line better. Overwhelmed by orders? Take fewer. But mostly just be honest. This is insane, as is waiting for in person orders on front of a table on not picked up phone/web orders."
Equator Coffees,Golden Gate Brg,Great coffee and lots of yummy and fresh pastries. They are very friendly and I love getting my coffee here. I hope they open up the inside seating so I can enjoy the coffee and breakfast inside.
