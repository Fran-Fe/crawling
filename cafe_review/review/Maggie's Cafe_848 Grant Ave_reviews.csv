Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Good service, nice and clean place, and good tea. Mongolian beef plate is really good. Also kids friendly, I went with a 3 months baby and is a good environment to lunch in the Chinatown."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Disappointing experience; tea served in paper, duck came in salty, hard and luke warm. No small bowl fried rice option."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,When we entered they gave us the menus and one of my family members orders a dish and the waitress said that that dish was only for Chinese people she said that plate was to salty and only Chinese people could support all the salt and we ordered a milkshake and she said that she didn't know how to make it just horrible service
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Perfect sweet and sour soup, beef noodle, great service.   Looking forward to my next visit."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Terrible food and service! Those are even not really can be called Chinese food! I didn't want to pay tips, but the shop assistant force me to pay. I'm curious how they can servive in SF."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Authentic Hong Kong style (?) Chinese food. Nice environment, great service, you can charge, there is WiFi, etc! Great location, in the middle of Chinatown San Francisco, it is like an oasis in the middle of chaos!"
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,My husband and I stopped in at Maggies for the first time and it was amazing. The roast duck was delicious as was all of the other dishes and there were many.
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"DO NOT DINE HERE! Very rude. Rushes you and then forces you to leave tip. Service is not welcoming at all. Did not give us water but gave to other customers so we took some water that we had with us from our bag and she wouldn't let us drink it. After we left, she still asked us to tip her and when we didn't because she didn't deserve it, she rolled her eyes and snatched the bill. Do not waste your money here. Bad experience. I can't leave this review unless I rate one star. Doesn't deserve a star."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"We had sweet & sour pork, chicken with cashew, egg fried rice, roast pork & it was all delicious. Big portions & good meat. Very tasty & enjoyable. Waitress was polite & efficient. I would definitely recommend here."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,this is not only a coffee shop! actually there is food too! they have chicken fried  rice and broccoli beef and dumpling soup! lots of treasure! and the waitress services is really good! thats why i gave them 5 star!
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Nice food. However the waitress who served us, who I assume was the manager/ boss was extremely rude, I was horrified as an English tourist to be bullied and belittled by this Chinese woman. Our Bill was fairly expensive, and in England it is not mandatory to give a tip if you do not feel it was necessary. We paid the bill and the woman said ""no the bill is without tip you have not paid the tip."" We had give a $4 tip. However she argued with us, demanding us for more money, saying that we hadn't paid enough money. She started to say to us ""I know that where you are from you may not understand this but you must pay a tip."" Which we found was very rude as she was questioning our knowledge. While eating our meal, people would look at the menu in the shop window for no more that 3 seconds and she would be out there asking ""how many on your table,"" making people feel uncomfortable and giving the impression of a desperate owner. Reading other reviews on here I can see that people have received a similar service.  We have been to America every year for the past 20 years and many times to California. We have been to many restaurants and hotels and I can say that this woman was by far the rudest waitress I have ever met. She questioned our knowledge, she bullied us into getting more money out of us, cash only restaurant with very little signage saying that they didn't accept cards, she was desperate for customers and the food was overpriced.  I can not put into words how awful this place is for service and how shocked I still am. I'm an easy going person and never have I been so close to losing my temper at someone."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"The waitress raised the price WAY higher than it was supposed to by the menu. We paid with card since we didn’t have cash and she demanded a tip, we couldn’t pay her cash so she’s charged the card fifteen dollars more! What a rip off! The service was definitely not worth that much."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"The food was nothing special and we were rushed while ordering and eating. Forced to give a high tip as well, such a rip off."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Good spot for lunch. Nice service!
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Food was nice, but the rest was really questionable. Waitress demanded a tip, not included in the receipt, 5 dollars. Plus we were ignored at the end and we had to ask for the mandatory tea."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"TERRIBLE service and TERRIBLE  food. She messed up my order, slammed our items down on the table, and did not fill up our water. I did not feel like she deserved a tip and she refused to let us leave the restaurant until I tipped her.  DO NOT EAT HERE"
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Waitress demands tip after horrific service. Harasses you if you don't. She is super impatient doesn't let you order what you want(we asked for a certain special 5 times!!!!). Extremely small portions. We left a tip after an egregious experience and she demanded more?? She made people leave to open up tables. After we firmly declined her tip request she showed us other customers receipts that have tipped. We had to leave while in mid-argument.
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"The lady is super nice and very welcoming.  She makes sure orders are on time to serve.  Food is so good too.  However,  the place is kinda small for big groups."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Do not make the same mistake and do not order lunch there. The appetizer was cold and the meet in the main course was terrible. I wanted to spare the owner and I didn't complain and I got yelled at because I didn't leave the tip.
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"The food isn't good. But the worst part is the waitress. She forces you to pay more tip (she doesn't beg, she litterally forces you). And then she kicks you out to make more room for new clients. Worst café ever"
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Every thing is good!  And plus why are u complaining about someone who works their.We all have different taste buds.That lady isn’t even bullying.She is really nice to.And she never made the prices.Her manger did.
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Bad food. Desperate owner. Covered up the cash only sign so when she took our card it seemed like it was a favor. The food was cold. Overpriced. Be warned people went in and out saying how expensive the items were.
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"LOVE their passionfruit tea, hot or cold. I could live on it! My bf liked the food he ordered too. Always have nice people working there :-)"
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Small portions for the prices. If you don’t leave a tip the owner will follow you out and remind you that the tip isn’t included on the amount due. She will harass you till you leave a tip.
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,DO NOT STOP!  FORCED TO GIVE A STAR Forced me to give her more tip. Lied and told me that San Francisco has a 10% tip. The table covers were dirty and the food was okay. Overpriced and not enough options for vegetarians.

Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"The dim sum was ok here, some items better than expected, others a bit worse."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"STAY AWAY! Appalling service. Got order wrong, overcharged on bill and then hassled for a tip chasing us down the road."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,Good food. You should always leave a tip.

Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Fast and punctual service, Chinese style. Three of us took the menu for lunch, with $ 50 including tip we ate discreetly and abundantly. Waitress a little hasty, but efficient and also fun. They don't have alcohol but you can get and pay for it with the assistance of the waitress in a nearby place."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"I can only advise against visiting this restaurant. The quality of the food was okay, but the service (possibly the boss?) was very unfriendly, even rude.  While I was there, two young men, after paying, were asked in a rather inappropriate tone to pay two dollars more because it was not enough. Slightly unsure and puzzled, the two gave her two dollars each and left. Apparently this was a desired tip.  Another customer walked into the store and while he was about to place an order at the counter, the same waitress asked him to say whatever he wanted because she was very busy.  When it was my friend and I's turn to pay, we decided to keep the tip small due to the not-so-great quality, but mostly because of the poor service. When the waiter noticed this, she also sparked a discussion with us that we should pay more or tip more. She got really loud when we made it clear to her that we weren't responsible.  While we were leaving, she complained loudly to the other guests that it was an impertinence. Incomprehensible!!!  Sure, the tipping rules in the USA are a little different than in Germany, but service and quality are still crucial for us here. Neither was given."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"Very good restaurant. I found my squid a bit bland and too rubbery, but otherwise it was delicious. The prices are also very affordable and the quantity served is very very good!"
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"I had never eaten Indian food, I ordered a chicken dish that I didn't even know what it was, when it arrived it looked like a crispy pancake with a delicious chicken filling. I loved the experience."
Maggie's Cafe,848 Grant Ave,"To flee, I found a hair in my dish, in France I would not have paid for my dish but here, no choice, after that I refused to leave a tip and the cashier still had the nerve to moan, she purposely speaks quickly so that we don't have time to choose, to flee, to flee, to flee!!"
