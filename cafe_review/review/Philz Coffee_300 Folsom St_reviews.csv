Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Super unique ice mint mojito coffee!  I love the taste of it and I don't think it can be found anywhere else other than SF. It possibly becomes the iconic coffee drink of SF!
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Interesting Philz location. Located on Beale St. and Folsom St. South of Market area. Located across from The temporary transit terminal. Also blocks from the Bay Bridge 80 entrance. This Cafe is roomy and clean. I love the glass and concrete architecture. The coffee and pastries are typical Philz, meaning all the successful ingredients are available."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Iced tea with just the right amount of light honey , light ice. The sandwich the plant based meat kind of on the dry side . Nice small table and chairs . Benches. , bright light Also, outside seating"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Delicious coffee, kind staff. Tantalizing Turkish was a good choice for a bold taste."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Fine for a quick coffee downtown. Not much of a vibe inside - no many seats and an awkwardly large waiting area. You'll have to find an outdoor seat if you're not heading off back to the office or somewhere else.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Great coffee (my favorite is the Philtered Soul Cold Brew) and great friendly service. Location is never too busy. I can't in my heart take off stars for this, but it is frequently very hot or (more often) very cold in here! When I sit and work for a while this can be very unpleasant."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Just tossed my first post-pandemic Silken Splendor into the trash after 4-5 sips. Ordered it sweet and creamy every day from the same location before lockdown, but got something that tastes like a second pour-over and not what I remembered. I guess it's back to brewing my own Bustelo for me..."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"three baristas present, one on the phone, I was waiting for a few minutes and left unnoticed. food options were pretty sparse but I acknowledge it was Friday evening."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"My iced Mint Mojito is the only reason I get up in the mornings. When it’s cold out, I also love an off-the-menu Oatmeal Cookie. Plus, the Philz baristas are such a vibe ✨"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,genuinely the nicest coffee I’ve ever tasted. Jacob Wünderbar and Philtered Soul are my go tos! Gonna miss this place when I go back to the UK! Taking as many bags of ground beans as the TSA will let me get away with!  also a lovely trans and queer friendly space
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Recently moved to San Francisco. The coffee is tasty. Service is friendly. Recently started ordering from their app and it is always ready when I get there.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Friendly service, decent coffee but pretty dirty interior.  Also the seating layout isn't great if one side is occupied by someone working from home and teleconferencing"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I had a cup of Jacob’s Wonderbar and my wife had a cup of Canopy of Heaven. We also tried the onion and bacon croissant and Philz bagel. Coffee was great and the perfect temperature. The food was good as well. Will return next time I’m in San Francisco.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"This Philz Coffee is my favorite coffee shop in San Francisco SoMa area. I usually order Iced Coffee Rose, and this is my super favorite at Philz Coffee. The favor is really refreshingly. If you are around here please try this coffee shop :) Hope you guys enjoy the coffee experience here!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"The best coffee ever, baristas know what they doing, they have great blends of coffee. My favorite coffee place in San Francisco"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Apparently the best coffee in San Francisco and once I tried it I can definitely say I have not had coffee like this before . Absolutely amazing
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"First time trying this Philz Coffee and it was AMAZING! Staff were super friendly and really enjoyed seeing how each cup is freshly made, I had a Tesora and I highly recommend!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Clean and brand new, this Philz is bringing their signature coffee to the South Beach neighborhood of San Francisco.  The space is light and airy with plenty of seating inside and out on the sidewalk.  Like all Philz locations, the baristas will ask you how you like your coffee and the brew to suit a cup customized just the way you like it best.  If it isn't right, let them know and they'll make it right.  Personal favorite: Iced Mint Mojito"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I love this coffee! My fav is mint mojito! And bakery is also good! I have had it twice a werk. I think I am addicted Lol. It can be the reason why I have to visit this city again.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,It's your typical Philz which is to say that it's pretty high-quality for chain coffee. The baristas here are always super friendly and even when they have a line they process drink orders quickly. They have seats with large tables indoors and outdoors.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,This Philz is great. It’s on a very tidy corner in the financial district. The area doesn’t get too much foot traffic and is usually relatively quiet compared to other places. So this Philz usually has some extra seats and always has very pleasant outdoor seating!  Baristas are very nice and the place is well staffed so they’ll make your drink pretty quickly.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Philz coffee has delicious beverage and food options, both hot and cold. It is often busy, but service is fast and friendly. I would recommend the Ecstatic iced coffee and the Philz Bagel."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Phillz is the only way to start your day. Individually brewed to your taste and a very friendly staff make it the first stop on my way to the office in SF.  Mobile ordering is available as is ample seating and wifi if you need to get some work done
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Holy Moly! The Mocha coffee thingy is the absolute best remedy after an all-nighter to get back in the groove. As a very high-level and well-respected tech entrepreneur, I can vouch that Philz is the pre-eminent coffee house in this entire tech corridor.  If you're a tech entrepreneur and make some serious coinage, spending it here will make you more efficient than any microdose you learned about on Rogan's podcast.  The mocha is the crack crakety and not the kind they smoke on the street out front.  Come and get it!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Best rose latte ever . Follow my food Instagram if you want.. @connoisseur009
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Iced mint mojito is where it’s at. Avocado toast with a hard boiled egg on top is half the price of any sit down place and just as good.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Best coffee in SF! I love the sweet and creamy mint mojito coffee.  The chai is also very nice. Only drawback is the weird ordering system that causes long waits.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I enjoyed the tea, they dont and the Almond pastry"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great coffee with a wide range of roasts and flavors. This is my go to store when picking up coffee with coworkers or when I'm just feeling lazy in the morning. Many people I know really enjoy Philz as well. You can order in store or ahead of time through the app. The app is easy to use and will give you an approximate pickup time. I do recommend ordering through the app to minimize wait time because Philz is pretty popular; the app order prep time is always less than 10 minutes in my experience. There are creative drinks in addition to more traditional ones. My personal favorite coffee is the Philtered Soul.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Possibly the best Philz? The seating space is great - there is a variety of cushiony chairs and also tables if you want to get some work done. There are also several tables outside. Never been disappointed in my order here!
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great coffee. Strong but not too bitter.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Amazing staff, playful menu. The coffee and food was also pretty good (I got the recommendation for the ""faux meat"" muffin). On the flip side, I spent here a morning doing some laptop work, and it was not the greatest space. They have great wifi and outlets, but the space itself feels very ""pass-through"" and uninviting, and seating is not super-comfortable either. Most people only come here for a takeout, and I would recommend for a takeout if you live nearby, but not for an extended sit-down period."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"The coffee tastes great here. This place is for everyone, but the menu makes it easy for aficionados to order the exact flavor that they desire. They are listed by roast and then a description is given of each blend.  The chai is very tasty. My favorite coffee blend is Philtered Soul. I also like their Mocha Tesora drink."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Awesome coffee place in San Francisco downtown.  I stopped here with a couple of friends and we all find their coffee extremely good.   One is the best coffee place I have been to.   I had a good experience with customer service.  But one of my friend's complaint about customer service,  first he bought the coffee and croissant with me and we both tipped. Later he decided to buy the coffee beans since the coffee was really good.  I didn't go in with him but he mentioned that this time he didn't tip and the person at the checkout gave him a cold response.   Also, the person took over 15 mins to get him the coffee beans, even though it was already packed which I also noticed it. I would have given them 5 stars as this is an awesome coffee place.  But taking away 1 star as my friend had a bad experience with customer service and I also saw the delay. Overall I will recommend this place to everyone.  If you are in the San Francisco area, please check out this place."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great spot to get some work done. Super friendly staff. Great coffee. Bakery selection is meh.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Loved this Philz location with big windows and long extension cords.  Atmosphere: can be noisy in the morning with long waits, but generally great  Value: would recommend as one of the more affordable coffee chains with options to downgrade on the sweetness level :)"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Mostly good service in the morning, only once was my mobile order forgotten. There are plenty of benches and seats in the outdoor space, plus doggy water bowls.  Definitely not a good place to get a coffee if you’re not living or walking in the neighborhood. There is no parking nearby and literally the only passenger loading zone is always occupied by someone who parks and leave their hazard lights on. Too often there are cars parking in bike paths for this. I would definitely recommend ordering from a different Philz if you are picking up and doing mobile as you’ll circle a few miles to find a place to park."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Sweet people and delicious food. Coffee is flawless.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Great service, great tasting coffee drinks both hot and cold!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I love that they make every cup, individually. If you want it a little stronger, just ask. A little sweeter, no prob.  And if you get it, and simply dont like it, that's okay, hand it back and try something else. Their pastries and avocado toast are terrific. I always have a great experience when I purchase coffee at Phil's."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great drinks and friendly staff. Small snafu with our order and they were more than happy to help. Great stop and fun drink options.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"An interesting cup!!! (#philzGetsABit5) pic (#un&related) but the best place to drink it is there. The conversation is magnificent and (#malificentKcnkd) .,.'_"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Hands down, amazing service/quality/ coffee and culture. You walk by it and you want to go in. The staff made an unpleasant day and transformed my attitude into something what I would describe as genuinely happy and that just doesn't happen too often. Not to mention the crowd it attracted was a bunch of construction guys that were hot and felt comfortable going in there.  It truly is amazing. Did I mention how good and strong their coffee is? Check it out."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Ordered on TooGoodToGo $3.99
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"This is one of my favorite Philz for the location! They have a lot of outdoor seating that make a great spot for meeting someone to chat, or just to sit and people watch. This is also a really fast Philz for how busy they always are.  And this is probably pretty anecdotal but I thought it was funny. There's a Starbucks down this same block and while I was people watching I saw two people walking down with their Starbucks drinks and food in their hands. When they passed Philz one of them said, ""Dang, we should have gone there instead!"""
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"For those who don't know, Philz does superior drip coffee made by people who take your enjoyment seriously. Don't worry about the wine-like adjectives associated with each blend; order what sounds good, a and if you dislike the flavor, they are happy to make you a different blend"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Coffee is amazing. Employees really chill. I spilled a bit of coffee and they charged me a small instead of a large size.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"My first time. We walked past 7 Starbucks and one other Philz to get to the original (my niece has been to the other so...?). If you crave that really REALLY hard to find cup of delicious brewed coffee unadulterated by every form of goo to make it palatable to a 12 year old, you are home!! I tried the Dancing Waters and its IN MY HEAD! They added the cream for me and it was perfect-- I mean perfect PERFECT."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,So good coffee and excellent service.  I had the best toasted bagel I have ever tasted.  Nice outside searing and you can see the Salesforce building from where we sat.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Love their avocado egg toast. Had their green tea, it was good."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Good coffee, and interesting brews. If you like exotic flavors in your coffee, this is the place for you. It can get a bit pricey, but the flavors are wort it. The staff was friendly and helpful and the overall atmosphere was welcoming and modern."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Super nice staff, great coffee of course, yummy almond crousant (heated)"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"If you're looking for a vibe that is as bold and pleasant as the brews, Philz is your spot. Service is always quick and fluid and there are so many options to choose from - coffees and baked goods included. They even happen to have some discounted merch sometimes as well. The store is beautiful and the views from indoors help to create a perfect environment for studying, a meeting, or catching up with friends."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"If you have the time to wait for a slow drip coffee, definitely go to a Philz. Their coffee is amazing. But like I said, you do have to wait a bit longer here than you would at your local starbucks, so make sure you have a few extra minutes."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Tastes like cake: cold brew with Philtered Soul straight up. Large. The other Philz are imposters.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Tried their pumpkin slice, vanilla scone, banana bread and a Kouign Amann. Of these the first 2 were meh but the last too were really good. Banan bread was soft and the right amount of sweet. The Kouign Amann pastry was crispy and a delight to bite into."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"They brew coffee by the cup and it's so good!  The pastries are okay, good but nothing special.  All of the choices are fun because of how creative they got with the different flavors that are infused into their ligh, medium, and dark roasts.  If you're a coffee lover looking for something different or just looking for a good cup of joe I totally recommend this place!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Good teas, all beverages freshly made to order. They do not have espresso drinks. Always somewhere good to go, though I wish they had mugs for drinking on site rather than paper cups."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Wonderfully Artisanally crafted coffee poured one cup at a time. So well crafted, smooth and flavorful. Served in an unpretentious and minimalist setting. Handcrafted pastries, locally sourced ingredients. Treat yourself to some of the best coffee on the planet - seriously good."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Definitely a walking destination, as there is no parking reasonably near that isn't charged in 15 minute intervals.  It is across the street from the temporary transbay terminal on Folsom and Fremont.  Philz does not serve espresso; only coffee, but the coffee will give most people a good buzz.  The flavor is not as harsh as Pete's.  The baristas are friendly and make sure your order is to your taste.  Order and have a seat on the benches across from the bar, then pay after you get your order."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Another vendor jumping in on the gourmet coffee craze. Great atmosphere, good service, knowledgeable staff.  Our barista took the time to explain every nuance of the ""concept"" and mechanics. High priced, pour-over only (both tea and coffee), slow - ostensibly because it takes time for the ""perfect pour"". If you're one to turn up your nose at drip coffee and don't mind paying the price for ""hand crafted"" drinks - this is the place for you."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Good food, but always a bummer when they forget your order...twice. Thankfully one of the coffee baristas saw my very visible frustration and got me what I wanted! Still, the way the cashier handled the situation...could have been better. I'd totally give you guys another chance at some point though. Maybe just a bad day. Have a good one!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Great service and great coffee. When your down on your last oomph and need a little waking up, phioz coffee will definitely get your spirit up. Try their Tantalizing Turkish coffee, its actually really darn good!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"One of my favorite location! Besides an obvious fact that it’s coffee delicious , the people who work there are soooooo nice. I always feel great after chatting with the employees, I even would say I feel like home when I come here 🦞 never came across rude or lukewarm  attitude, only great fast service. Great job team …"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Curse Sundays when Philz is the only place open. Nice store/location but a regular cup of coffee at $4.67 is too much. And same price for refills? Yes. And they ration the milk/sugar in the name of ""service"". I can't wait til the Sunday monopoly is over & Pete's around the corner on 1st/Howard is open Sundays. Good coffee there, comfortable interior, nice courtyard & $1 refills and they just launched custom drip coffee (March 2018). Then I'll say ""Later $5 cup of regular coffee!"""
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Loved my experience here. Friendly baristas, amazing flavors in their coffee (and a wide selection for any taste) and a flavorful avocado toast that was simple, hearty and tasty for a breakfast option. Will definitely recommend to friends visiting San Francisco."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Very conveniently located Philz store (right next to the Temporary Transbay Terminal!). I do love their coffees, particularly the Mocha and the Iced Mint Mojito are great. But a lot of the coffees are very good, and they have a large selection of blends."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I ordered a black coffee (which I was told would take 3-4 minutes) and a Turkey sausage-and-egg sandwich, and that came to ten dollars and change.  It was also quite crowded when I came in and the line moved slowly.  Quality was good and service was friendly."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Wow! There is no competition when it comes to this coffee. Super high quality product and classy staff. Highly recommended over virtually all other cafes.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Not sure if I am a fan of the drip coffee concept. Came there expecting for my morning cappuccino, and came out with something new. Yes it was made very accurately, and I could really feel the many notes of its taste, but  on the other hand, it’s still hard for me to digest such a watery coffee with cream."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,My first Philz. I d/n like. They make no espresso or espresso drinks. They have a fancy pour over method.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I got the Bacon and Onion croissant and The Chai tea. Let me tell you, it was so delicious!  The server was helpful with suggestions of tea. Overall nice people, nice environment, and definitely worth it! I will be coming back again."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I love philz and that's a fact It's quality coffee not like McDonald's or Jack Mint mojito is my go to drink It's the key to being conscience that's my link My second drink of choice is silk and soul It'll snap you into reality, a fix for any lull  Love this location, near my work but more importantly, clean, modern, and spacious. They also have order ahead (the app) for all you in a rush.  Can't say enough about this place but just that it's great!!!!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Heard great things, and maybe my experience was unique, but my iced mint mojito was simply bad. Tasted like over-creamed, watered down coffee."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,friendly & nice place aromatic & smooth coffee
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I wanted to order breakfast and one employee suggested a burrito because it was somewhat normal.  I said I'll take that but he stood there so I went to the coffee line and had to wait for a customer that came in. When it was my turn I asked for the burrito and was told to go back to where I originally was.  I told the guy that first helped me that I wanted the burrito again so they finally made it.  It was really over priced for mostly cheese and potatoes with some sausage.  But the entire time I waited the guy just stood there and did nothing.  Typical lazy young hipster. And coffee isn't that great.  This place is only good for free Wi-Fi and that's it
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Nice place. Single cup brewed coffee. Upscale and up prices but quality is worth it. Outlets for electronics. Friendly, way too hip staff. You'll want to date them."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Coffee is delicious.  Served with a big smile.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Best hot chocolate and coffee place - the vibe is great / the coffee and hot chocolate is made fresh one cup at a time which is great and they offer vegan milk and different types of sweetener at the same price
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Everything a coffee shop should be...  great natural light, places to sit and use a laptop, great service, and fantastic coffee.  They specialize in unique blends that end up making you crave them an hour later once your coffee is gone...   :)"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"It's a drip brew.... That means no lattes , capps, and la marzaca beverages that require a shot of espresso and frothy frothy leches.... Aí muchachacha... Great drip coffee for the lovers of a freshly catered cup."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Best Coffee in / Near financial district is Philz, and this shop on Folsom has the best barrista / service to boot."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Have been here many times as it is close to work. Excellent place if you are looking for strong and delicious coffee or tea or hot chocolate. Friendly staff and if you want super fast service use the app to order.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Super friendly staffs and really clean & cozy interior. Kouign Amann was delicious! Oatmeal cookies ☕ (Julie's + hazelnut + cinnamon in the filter) with medium soy was strong and flavorful. Will probably try adding honey next time.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"If you don’t know that they specialize in drip coffee and ask for a latte, be prepared to be mocked by the hipster “brew-tender”. Silly me! I left and got a nice latte at Joe and the Juice down the  street."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,The food is out of bounds! Coffee was the best coffee I have ever had. Amazing place. The pancake pot pie is a must!
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Not my type of coffee, but I liked it and is definitely better than Starbucks. If you want to try something new, give it a go. Plus I think their teas are good."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"This brand new Philz location simply rocks! Spacious and with lots of natural light, located on the busy intersection of Folsom and Beale. This neighborhood definitely needs an addition to Starbucks and Peets, especially on the weekend.  I enjoy the friendly service here, and of course my favorite drink, the Tantalizing Turkish. Also make sure to try their crowd pleaser, the MINT MOJITO.  Brand new and just awesome. Philz', the San Francisco-bred coffee shop, is growing!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"go to this Philz location multiple times a week. Most of the time I will use the Caviar app to avoid the lines in the morning and just pick up my coffee and go. If I'm not in too much of a rush, a huge part about Philz is the experience of ordering from your barista and then having a sip to make sure that it's just right.  Highly recommend the Iced Mint Mojito. I tend to have the Iced Mint Mojito as a treat and go with a dark roast black coffee like Julie's Ultimate as well as Philharmonic (with mint) on a more regular basis."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I love how this chain coffee Co. went for it. The coffee market is over saturated and dominated by large chains. However, philz saw a niche, threw caution to the wind and opened a slow pour cafe. Lines are out the door. Good job guys."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Very interesting coffees, really enjoyed it, just make sure you're looking for coffee, not an espresso or something like yours find at a Starbucks"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great tea and coffee but the baristas are rude and never fill the cup to the top ☹️
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Great service, fun people, and a wonderful selection. Spring for the Philz iced tea with mint (large, of course) and a Fresh Cucumber and Tomato Bagel on Asiago. You won't regret it."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Love this Philz location! They are right on the SOMA bike route & the baristas are nice even if it's busy. Plus, Philz gives you a discount price for bringing your own cup."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I went to philz coffee near Folsom st San Francisco, I tried new rose cafe cold there, it was very fresh taste and felt like relaxed. Must try that if you want to taste differ."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"I judge cities by their coffee shops, luckily for SF, they're currently a frontrunner. Luckily for SF they have Philz. Just got myself their app so I can order while walking over, and it's ready when I arrive. Can't beat this next level efficiency! Personal favorites include philtered soul, the Michael Jackson, and Jacob's wunderbar. Thank me after you go K thanks bye."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I've never seen such love and attention given to my order of a small decaf coffee. Philz decaf is truly decaf btw. Most are most certainly not. Google it. And it is still is a very satisfying cup of coffee. Thank you Stevey and the gang.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"This location is a godsend. Thanks to this Philz Coffee, I am able to enjoy my favorite coffee just how I like it every single morning. Baristas are very friendly as well."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Have been getting Philz since their first location opened. Now with so many locations, it's so much more convenient. They always have a friendly staff and great coffee!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"If you really like coffee, this is the place to go. The first time I went there I thought I was in a Starbucks-like place and asked for a cappuccino, and was replied they don't do that :-). There are so many different coffees with different tastes, I love it."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I tried Philz Coffee because of the high rating.  Really don't get the combo of mint in coffee.  I feel like really good coffee doesn't need mint in it.  But the space of the shop is nice.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Newest philz coffee and totally love this location. There's a bit of construction around this corner but that should not deter you.  Familiar great coffee and they are open weekends, so excited!"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great coffee and snacks. Amazing service and very friendly people
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Super charming place right next to the greyhound bus terminal,  friendly staff make for a wonderful experience. Also the twice baked almond croissant was awesome,  get it warmed for ""thrice baked""."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Best light roast coffee I have ever had. Normally Starbucks ends up burning their blond roast, this was on a completely different level of amazing."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Another great Philz.  Big windows and open space. Has some window facing bar seats and a table that can fit 4.  So not a great Philz for working but great coffee and people.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Comfy seats, some music and you’ll see pet owners coming in with their dogs once in awhile; does add to the liveliness of the place"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Went on a Saturday and Sunday on my last trip to SF. This location had an awesome staff (all their locations do). Great coffee as always!
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Great coffee. Variety a plenty to please all tastes. Toilets do not require a passcode. Cheerful staff. Seating available inside and out.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"This coffee tastes great, but more importantly, it gave me the energy boost I needed. I don’t know what roast they use, but it works"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I love Philz coffee...a bit pricey but worth it
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Philz coffee, on the street corner of Beale and Folsom in San Francisco. Expect the usual selection of filter coffee drinks with delicious cream. My favourite remains the mint mojito ice coffee."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"i went in to this location for the first time on halloween, i was with someone who never had philz before and the gentleman at the first had a fantastic intro speach to breakdown what philz is all about. love the hospitality. this branch looks tight knit and efficient."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Pretty cool spot. Unique spin on drinks, friendly staff, lots of space"
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Very eclectic and cheerful staff putting together a tough to be at $5 pour over cup of coffee.    Only downside is their Caviar app is iPhone only.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,The coffee shop I have ever tried. The Jacob's is my favorite coffee
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,If you need strong coffee that is delicious this is the place. Relatively good hours and interesting drinks.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Coffee was unique and flavorful. Highly recommend it. Serves just pour-over coffee. No espresso. But the coffee is excellent.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,no latte here. but : great service to explain the medium roast choices. they added oat milk cream free. they have foam on top.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Love the coffee and the staff! I'd suggest you try one of the special iced coffees like Mint Mojito or Gingersnap. And definitely get it sweet and creamy. 👊😉 …
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,The coffee was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The prices were too high for me but you certainly get what you pay for!
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Seems to be a consistent wait here, but good coffee nonetheless. Not too many places to sit and work onside, but has nice outdoor seating."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,Who wouldn't love Philz? I love using Order Ahead for my tea every morning. Also the avocado toast and selection of pastries generally brighten my morning.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,"Their coffee tends to not stand out, yet require a lot of time to prepare.  Their pastries are the kind that rely on reheating and are, unfortunately, sub par."
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,If you like a side of pretense with your coffee this is the place. Hipster heaven for overpaid techies and woke type. Coffee is a step above most places though.
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,This coffee is by far best coffee I've ever had . Tesora is my favorite.  They make each cup 1 at a time . It's like a custom coffee . Thanks pgil
Philz Coffee,300 Folsom St,I've never been disappointed by any Philz locations - expect consistent great brews. Staff is always friendly and welcoming!
