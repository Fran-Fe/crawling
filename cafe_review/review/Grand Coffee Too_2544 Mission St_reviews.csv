Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,This place is more of an Art Gallery with a coffee shop area than a typical coffee shop. There isn't much place to sit but it has a big wide open space with artwork to look at as your sipping your coffee. Still fantastic atmosphere and the service was very good!
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"An artistically designed coffee shop in the front of a gallery space. The only seating is one bar, and the barista can be like a host, and it’s easy to talk to other guests. Lovely for short human connections."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"Very good coffee overall! I got the nitro cold brew, although it didn’t have the texture that I personally like, the taste was very good. The espresso shot on the other hand was simply perfect. Smooth, no burnt taste, great temperature, and velvety. Takes hella skill to make it that good. They also have a house made piña vanilla syrup that is awesome! 🍍  Only reason for 4/5 stars is that I felt like with the space being only 6 seats, you constantly feel the pressure to leave. Even with only a few people there, it’s tough to relax. Therefore it’s  not really the coffee shop to sit down and chill in, which is a shame given it’s cool interior. I’d suggest just grabbing your coffee to go, or if you’re getting it for there, get a something like an espresso."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"Great coffee and unique latte flavors, but as other reviews have noted there are literally six seats. I respect the art gallery meets coffee house vibe but there’s still PLENTY of room where a community table and some stools could go so you aren’t left forced to stand or take your drink to go."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"Grand Coffee has been an essential neighborhood fixture for coffee and community for a decade. At last, their new flagship location opens! That same great coffee you love with some new twists, in a beautiful space shared with local galleries. Check it out."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"One of the worst drinks I’ve had at a cafe in a while. I ordered a Cortado which is espresso forward with some steamed milk. The milk in this drink was just heated, not steamed at all, and there was no attempt at any kind of latte art. Because of lack of steam the milk texture was not smooth at all. The espresso was also under extracted and had a hint of unpleasant astringency. Really not a worthwhile experience for a drink that cost $6. The gallery inside the cafe was cool though."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"Generally I'm suspicious of places that call espresso ""spro"", but this shop is charming and the espresso is delicious. The baristas were friendly and clearly had a good relationship with the regulars. The homemade palate cleanser was also a fun and unexpected touch!"
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"Awesome meeting one of the owners - Adrian - at the shop. If it's slow (coming at 8am on Sunday might be the only time that happens) you'll get a tasting of the coffee before you order. Beautiful space, surrounded by art, and their design is *chef's kiss* Wishing these folks the best as they expand...."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"An odd yet inviting space where art meets coffee. Spacious spot with very limited seating (~6 spots if I recall correctly), so would recommend taking to go unless you get lucky with seating! Great iced coffee."
Grand Coffee Too,2544 Mission St,"Went into use the restroom, got a cup of their coffee.  Didn’t specify anything special. But turn out to be surprisingly best coffee I had in SF.  Will drop by everytime I’m on Mission again."
