Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Just had their turkey burger and was delighted at how flavorful and juicy it was!! The seasoning reminded me of kabobs and the bun was toasted and crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. Best part is their renovated outdoor seating! I’ll have to take pictures next time
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"This place was ok. Been here more than once and when the weather’s nice it’s nice to be outside in the back. However it gets very busy and the indoor space is narrow. The menu is indistinguishable from any other brunch place in sf which is fine, and the standard dishes are fine, but the coffee was tasteless and the shakshuka tasted like a jar of pizza topping unfortunately"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,This is legitimately one of my favorite spots. Really kind people. The food is actually better than a lot of restaraunts in the area in my opinion. Underrated. Extremely sad to hear they are closing.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Great patio out back but food lacked memorability and flavor.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,My dog and I love brunch on a Saturday here. Really good food with healthy options. Friendly staff. We like watching all the leaves breeze in the wind on the patio
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Good food but server turned up the radio (using his cell phone) so loud that we couldn't talk. All three customers there immediately asked him to turn it down. Then he turned it down 5%, all three of us yelled it wasn't down emough, so he walked to the far end of the restaurant and turned it back up even louder. One of us then stood on a bench and unplugged the speaker, but soon another guy came and said the music was necessary ambiance. We all then left, disgusted."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,It looked cute on the outside and is well designed on the inside. The system of pay first and self seating was confusing at first. The staff was nice and the food was delicious. I could have sat in the back all day on their outside seating.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Absolutely FANTASTIC. The front barista had amazing service, the food delivery is prompt, even with a large group and skilled cooks with a perfect meal. I am NOT a local, will be making return trips here when in town :)"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Amazing local place, and their back patio is a special one."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,I would like to say THANK YOU to the young man behind the counter. He is a gentleman and a scholar for treating me and my daughter like human beings and not a couple of stray dogs off the street of San Fran. The small business community should take examples from this awsome Cafe and how it running its customer service. I was not a customer and I did not need to buy anything to be helped at a time of need. This courtesy means alot. I did buy 4 drinks with out having too. I will be back to order one of the delicious meals from there menu.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Simple and good food. Avocado toast was delicious!
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great food and drinks, friendly staff, and a nice garden patio with plenty of tables. Plenty of delicious healthy options. The mushroom ravioli is phenomenal. The chef cooked it perfectly."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"One of the nicest patios in the city. Feels secluded, they’ve even got a little water feature, garden, trees. Super friendly staff. The food isn’t amazing but it’s a big menu with lots of options, and even though the food’s not winning awards, the staff and patio make it a place I love to go, repeatedly, all the time!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,A lovely cafe in the heart of Cole Valley. Drink prices are surprisingly reasonable for San Francisco. Staff are very nice.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,They recently closed and that made me so sad. They were my favorite place in the neighborhood and there back patio was a small haven from the city.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Met friends for lunch in Cole Valley today. Decided on Cafe Reverie- haven't been here in years- since I lived a few blocks away. I used to love this place. Turns out it's still great. Sat on the back patio, and had the Salmon Bon Mi which comes with a salad. Delicious! My friend had a grilled cheese which comes with mushrooms and tomatoes inside, and maybe more, and also a salad. Looked great and they liked it too. Another friend had a vegan bowl- I'm going to get that next time. Healthy and delicious- not boring. Patio was lovely. Service was great and friendly. I was surprised it wasn't more busy, but it was a Monday, after 1pm when we got there. I'll be back soon. There's something for everyone in the menu and it was good."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Food was wonderful, but hard to find parking on the street, although."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The staff was great! We had brunch, it was wonderful. Very special day and place!!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Please get the breakfast porridge. We got it on a whim and I have never tasted anything so lovely. Almonds, apples, cinnamon, milk, coconut and a plethora of others come together to form a concoction fit for nothing less than royalty. The quote was “it tasted like a hug.” You won’t regret it! Great place and reasonable prices."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Delicious food and good service. Perfect cozy backyard for the brunch
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"One of the best breakfast burritos I ever had! The server, Osiris, was super cute! Definitely will be coming back."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Super awesome outdoor seating. Has a European feel with great brunch options. Be ready to spend 25-30 per person
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"First time in San Francisco; Love the food, love the ambience. Dined at the patio for an alfresco dining and the garden experience."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"This is the best cafe in San Francisco, where everything will exceed your expectations. From a delicious menu to the friendliest staff in town,   you'll regret to not have found this place sooner. Roger (the owner) really understands what it means to run a business while having fun and while making it seem super easy."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, and good prices for the Bay Area. I ordered a cappuccino with oat milk and the western omelet. The cappuccino was delicious and the food was fresh and well cooked. I would give it five stars since we had a lovely time and the food was fresh but it was unfortunately very under-seasoned. The omelet and potatoes had no salt or pepper and it definitely negatively affected the food. But, it’s still a great stop in a cute little neighborhood in the city nonetheless."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The owners have informed the media that they are closing their doors for good on February 19, 2023."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Quiet shady patio with excellent breakfast
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Amazing outdoor space out back with heaters and great lighting. Incredible food, was stuffed but couldn't stop eating it!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Really love the back patio space. Had the vegan bowl and it was unexpectedly delicious. I’m not normally a fan of cold foods outside of salad but this was almost similar? Idk. Try it! Also thank youuu for finally accepting credit cards! I’m not sure when this changed but I never would come here because it was cash only and I never carry cash.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Large outdoor patio and friendly service. WiFi and laptop use is not allowed so you don’t linger too long. I think this should be changed to non-peak times now that most things are opening. I was one of only a couple of people sitting in the back and no one was waiting. It would have been nice to have the option to do some work while enjoying my latte. Hopefully, this policy changes soon!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,I love the patio and eat here often (weekly). The food is tasty and you can't go wrong but sometimes things can be a bit hit or miss. The patio keeps me coming back though!  Definitely order breakfast food during a brunch rush to get quick service. Also once we received the wrong pizza after waiting a long time. It often takes quite a long time for orders to come up.  I'm really excited they started taking credit cards.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Little cafe was pretty good brisket... One thing was unusual there is no place on the bill with my credit card for a tip so bring cash
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,I love this cafe. I visit a friend in the neighborhood once a year and we eat breakfast there every morning. Such a friendly staff and great food at great prices. When the weather is good there is a lovely garden area in the back. Great Cole Valley neighborhood feeling & it's mainly locals in the mornings. The fresh brewed coffee is robust & tastey!
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Warm and friendly. Menu has many choices and they all look really good. My latte is well made- not too hot?! Awesome!!. Back patio is gorgeous. No wifi and cash only. Glad I had a little cash on me.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Nice local café with a huge beautiful outdoor back patio, with lots of seating, greenery, a little pond, and heaters to keep you warm on chilly evenings. Good selection of drinks and select food items."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Today was the culmination of the poor service my partner and I have received from one of the male employees at Reverie Cafe. Before I get into it I would like to say that I had enjoyed coming to Reverie for the last few years. My partner and I love the patio and have made a habit of coming in for breakfast 2-3 times a week. Before today's incident, we considered making it our go-to dinner option too. Due to the service of one employee, we will never step foot into the establishment again.  About a week ago the young man with bleached accents in his hair brought our breakfast out. Upon dropping the plates at our table he informed me - not my boyfriend just me - that outside beverages aren't allowed. This struck me as odd since I had brought drinks from Wooden Cafe every visit prior for the last month and a half. Each time the employees had seen me come in with drinks but had no issue. I relayed this tidbit of information to him. He responded in a rude tone and walked away.  Yesterday we went in for breakfast and the woman working the register acknowledged my partner's coffee while we ordered and proceeded without hassling us about it.  During this visit, the young man who had an issue with the coffee before said nothing about the drink as he dropped off our food. However, he did have the time to be rude to me by slamming my plate on the table while being quite kind to my boyfriend.  Today my partner and I decided to stop by for breakfast again. I went to grab a coffee while my partner went to order food - our usual routine.  Soon after I walk in with the drinks and the young man stops me to say I can't bring them in. The woman who saw my boyfriend come in with the coffee yesterday was standing right behind him.  At this point, I was fed up with the fact that ... the employees didn't seem to have a concise protocol for when they choose to make exceptions about drinks this particular employee was rude the issue was always directed to/at me a multiracial woman and not my partner who is a white-passing Jewish man he and the other employee on shift this morning insisted that we were reinventing the wheel by supporting another local business and bringing in coffee. This is pretty typical. I worked in service for over a decade in everything from cafes to five-star restaurants. Bringing coffee to breakfast simply isn't a big deal...  Today I yelled at him and I don't regret it. This young man has been rude to me each time I've encountered him. Not once was my partner subjected to the same treatment. When he brought in the drink yesterday the woman who took our order and assisted in the uproar today had no issue with the outside drink yet every time I have a drink it's an issue.  It strikes me as odd that at each turn today and others my white-passing boyfriend received much better treatment than me from a somewhat diverse staff. I guess a small brown woman comes off as a better target for microaggressions. They probably just weren't ready for me to defend myself."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Good food, very friendly service, nice indoor and outdoor patio and sidewalk seating. Unless you are up by the front window, the indoor seating can seem a bit cramped with most of it along the narrow side where people are walking by to the outdoor patio or to the bathroom or to look at the large overhead menus. It's a great cafe to sit and have a drink or a nice lunch."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The garden seating was really nice, the food was tasty. My kiddo had a Cuban sandwich, which was delicious (there was do much of it that we could share). I had the Turkish poached eggs, which were tasty, but not much of a meal by itself. Go with people so you can counterbalance the Barros serving sizes and have a fun family-style experience!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,this is a very cute spot! The server I had was Kike. Very friendly and super nice! Will be coming back forsure
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great cafe.  Excellent food,  Manny and the rest of the counter staff make you feel right at home. The back yard is fantastic, one of my favorite places in San Francisco to drink a mocha."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I love the garden here, it feels like a secret place and is peaceful enough tobeable to just to sit and read a book. They're relaxed about how long you stay,  regardless of what you've ordered, which is nice. There are also a couple of tables out front in case you or a friend are bringing a canine companion."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"A perfect place for breakfast, as they open early and have a great selection of bagels and warm dishes. Their coffee is delicious and the staff is friendly. I recommend three fried eggs with potatoes and sausages (try Chicken Apple!) for breakfast or brunch. Oh, and they serve pancakes too!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"This place feels a little sterile. The backyard its nice and I've never had a problem getting a seat in it, but the rest of the place just feels tight. The cheesecake I got was awesome though, but the beers are all bottled and ordering feels strange here. Can't place why, but I think it's a user interaction thing. Dunno. Good in a pinch."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Cash-only local cafe with some great egg dishes and pastries.  The line can get a bit long at times, which can sometimes make finding a table difficult.  Luckily, most patrons are pretty considerate and do not linger much after finishing their meal.  I love sitting by the window for the people (and dog) watching :)"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"This is a great little neighborhood cafe. The servers are quirky, and there are lots of little signs dictating how to be a good customer ""finish your call before ordering"" etc, but it does preserve the ambiance. Keeping that in mind, they also do not have wifi and they are cash only. On the upside, they make some really tasty soups, dips, and kebab plates. Beer and wine, too!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Great food and atmosphere. I love eating here with groups because you order at the counter. Be aware it's cash only and the closest ATM is down the block. They have a good variety of options and wonderful back patio where you can eat outside.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Nice gem brunch place with indoor garden
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"It's really hard to go wrong with this place. They take cash only but you get good coffee, and a really decent menu for breakfast or lunch options. For breakfast I just go for a simple bagel with eggs, bacon and cheese. For lunch, I am a big fan of the flat breads. They have a variety of them and the flat bread with cheese and meatballs is great."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Really great neighborhood cafe. Breakfast burritos are always great (get the house salsa on the side too). They use fantastic ingredients, being owned by the same person who owns Say Cheese"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I've been here dozens of times and will keep going back. People wait in line outside Zazie and the crepe place down the block when this place isn't full which I don't understand. Zazie is great, so I understand going if you can get in right away, but in terms of food quality it hardly has an edge on Cafe Reverie, if at all. I order the spinach/mushroom benedict or the salmon benedict every time and I am never disappointed. The huevos rancheros are solid too. Breakfast burritos not their highlight but great and lots of food for the price. Their home fries are wonderful but they started giving you less than before, don't know why. One of Reverie's greatest perks is it's *beautiful* patio out back, a hidden gem— although I swear it's more full every time I go, maybe people have finally caught on. With an open air patio with plants and vines all around, it's an idea brunch spot. Coffee is super solid too. My favorite brunch spot in SF!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Always come here.... great coffee, food, atmosphere. Yesterday got the Chile Quiles - to die for. Today I got the sweet porridge. Wow wow"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Awesome food for both brunch/lunch and dinner. Also, their back patio is large, quiet, and has heaters!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Fun place. Great sunny patio out back. (Umbrellas available too). Food was good. Staff friendly. Parking wasn't great.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,They have enough seats at the backyard that you'd feel safe eating there due to Covid.  The foods are pretty good and the portion are big enough.... would try different kinds next time.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Excellent brunch! There's garden patio seating and the ambience is warm and cozy. Prices are reasonable and ticks all boxes for the friendly neighborhood brunch place.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"San francisco really needs more of these intimate low key patios! The mediterranean plate here is really good and feels authentic. Other food options were good as well, especially for brunch. Have lunch here inside or in the backyard and then explore the area!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I've been here a few times. The coffee is pretty good, but the food is just alright. Unfortunately, I have never really enjoyed the service I've received. The employees seem pretty unhappy or annoyed to be at work. The last time I visited, they told me to clear off my own table and throw it a bus tub at the back of the cafe, Which I don't mind doing... But I clearly saw others tables that had not been tended to and I look over and the employees are just hanging out drinking coffee behind the counter... I would suggest visiting crepes on cole, across the street. They're a lot nicer, the food is really good, and the coffee is always delicious!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I LOVE their patio. Food's quite good too, at very reasonable prices. When it's a sunny day and you want a nice place to read, head to their patio. There are also a bunch of cool cats hanging around there too."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Minus one star for being CASH ONLY.  Don't underestimate this ""cafe food"" . The tandoori chicken wrap, pizza, ahi tuna salad and basically everything are so good!! They make an italian meatball soup in the winter that is the most amazing thing. The outdoor seating in the back is nice on a sunny day. Services is quick and portions are large for the price compared to the boulangerie, down the street. If you are going to spend $10 on a salad, get it here."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Forgettable food but nothing super bad. Espresso was absolutely not good at all. Nice back patio bumps it up a star.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Outdoor patio, fountain, great food. Try the Cava Rose, delicious. Highly recommend. The perfect spot to wait while Fix My Phone tries to recover the data on your busted iPhone!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"This is a great coffee shop in Cole Valley.  Their lattes are fantastic and their food is excellent, especially the pizzetas (warning, they are not small as one would think).  The outdoor patio in the back is beautiful on a nice day.  Reverie's greatest downfall is its lack of wifi."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Had a sad bland breakfast burrito. No salsa, no sour cream and barely any of the chorizo I paid extra for. You would think the quality of the food would have gone up after raising their prices so much, but now it's mediocre at best."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Food is pretty good and the back patio is really cute. Their coffee isn't great and it is cash only. However, overall it's worth the visit! Their oatmeal and shakshuka are really good."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The servers were good but I was not impressed with the food for dinner. The bread was stale, and none of the many entrees we ordered were, in my opinion. worth the price. The coffee was good, perhaps I would go back for breakfast."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Turkey Kabob sandwich is super delicious. The Kabob Sandwich comes with a salad. The coffee is descent, but not great. The cafe has an outside patio that is really spacious and well kept."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great and inexpensive food, ideal for a lunch break.  My favorite is their prawn and asparagus pizzetta that comes with a salad on the side.  It's quick, fresh and tasty.  Add the best white mocha in town and you are set."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"One of my favorite places for coffee in Cole Valley. Their pastries are always fresh and the coffee is prepared always with care. When not full, it is a nice place to read a book or catch up with a friend. Unfortunately, sometimes I think twice before stopping here because it's cash only."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I wouldn't say this place has the best service or the friendliest vibe, but the great backyard patio and proximity to Haight St/Cole Valley will make me a repeat patron. You can bring sandwiches over from the Cheese Shop next door, and don't even need to buy a drink (to be fair, I actually wanted to buy a drink, but no one came over to help me). No wifi or available outlets, so not the best place to get work done."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The mezze plate is the perfect fresh, crunchy, nutritious, flavor-packed meal. Or shared plate. And the patio is lovely. And it's much more laid-back then other cafes in the area."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Popular local spot, especially for coffee and breakfast. Generous serving sizes. Egg scrambles and vegetarian benedict were  excellent.They have a nice outside patio in back."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Cash only! That's one of the big drawbacks to coming here, but aside from that the place has satisfying meals and some decent coffee. The chorizo burrito was especially good.  Their back area is great if you can find seats."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Always absolutely amazing! Incredibly friendly staff, passionate cooks. Great service and great food. And the back patio? Breakfast date perfect."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Closed!
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Fair warning, this place is cash only. I've only been for breakfast and you get pretty big portions. The food is pretty good but if the weather is nice, the back patio is really the place to be."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The back garden patio is nice on a warm day. Menu has a variety of options. Beer, wine, mimosas. Mixture of people having casual lunch & solo customers on their computers."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Nothing short of Fabulous!  Such goodness. Avocado toast, salmon Benedict and coffee. Yummy. Highly recommend. I’ll be back my next time through."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"No waiting, no lines. They have a pretty nice garden  patio at the back. Pretty good food (we had Huevos Rancheros, Cinnamon French toast, and coffee)."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"OVERVIEW Café Reverie provides a pleasurable dining experience set in an inviting atmosphere. The patio dining area is especially nice on a clear day. . SUGGESTION If you're a fan of eggs benedict, which I am, I highly recommend the Spinach Shitake Mushroom Benedict. Excellent."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,So tasty
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Chill spot. Had a beer and the grilled cheese with portobello mushroom. Very good. The back patio is relaxing
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I love their back patio. It's a perfect place to grab a cup of joe and hang out. Be forewarned, they don't have wifi. So, bring a book and relax. They make more than coffee. Try out their food too - especially for lunch."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The couple of times I have tried to go to Zazie in Cole Valley I have ended up here (too hungry to wait 2 hours for brunch at Zazie)! This is a cute little cafe with a little back patio that gets some good sun. The food is always great and you can get your morning coffee or mimosa too. I had the special which was a veggie scramble with a side of fruit. The side of fruit was legit - apples, pears, berries, instead of the usual melon balls that most places serve. Be prepared - it's cash only."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Just got a coffee here but it was delicious and on top of that the people working there were so kind!! Would definitely come back!
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Nice garden patio. I only had a macchiato and a rugalasch. Macchiato tasted good but the presentation a bit wanting. At least they used good beans.  Update 2015/09/26: had the frittata special. Very good.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Awesome back patio, delicious latte and a very filling breakfast burrito with pulled pork. Great place to relax and read (off the street - no people watching) if the weather is nice."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Lot's of variety of good quality food, you can get Mexican and middle Eastern food . Their brunch is good too. However the highlight is their patio , which is a backyard garden feels very friendly and homy"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Convenient location if you're taking MUNI (the N stops very close) and just want coffee, but the food is very good and priced well. A nice selection of salads and entrees for dinner. Cash only though, be prepared."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The food was great, great customer service. I love the outside patio area."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Back patio is nice. Food is pretty good. Don't leave a tip on your credit card. Service is, go get it yourself."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"One of my favorite local haunts. Great brunch, good prices. Very crowded late weekend mornings, so may be hard to get a table at that time."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Been going for over 20 years. They are making smart incremental changes without cutting the connection to the past. Food is great. They care about creating a sense of space and community.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Cool! And the employees are very nice
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Cute cafe nestled in Cole Valley with lots of dessert options, a few bottled beers and an outdoor patio. The outdoor chairs could stand to be more comfortable, especially since the outdoor area is such a perk. If you've spent an afternoon in Haight Ashbury and you're headed back to the Muni, it's a decent spot to stop for a cup of coffee, a slice of cheesecake or a bite."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great breakfast,  delicious coffee and a lovely garden to eat in. Very courteous staff. Wanting to go back"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,The outdoor backyard patio area makes this place so much better. The food is decent but that back area makes it one of my favorite bruh check spots
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"I don't know what I would do with the folks at Reverie. This has been a mainstay in my life for the past 6 years and I hope it continues to run with great coffee, good people, great eats and a beautiful back yard. FYI -- it is Cash only."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Love that for a whole $1.95 I can grab an iced coffee and not feel guilty! The only reason I give 4 stars is because I have yet to try their food/pastries, and cash only, otherwise I highly recommend a pit stop!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great place, but I'm considering stopping going (I live next door) until they allow card payment. it's excessively annoying to have to crash their neighbor's ATM every time and add $2.50 to the check."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Reverie indeed. This is a fine place for a day-dreaming afternoon break. I friend and I enjoyed an excellent and affordable mid-eastern repast in the back terrace sun, then moved indoors for coffee (excellent latte) as the sun shifted."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Love this place, the garden patio in the back is awesome to enjoy a cup of coffee, meal or just an afternoon reading. It's sunny and very nice."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"This place is so pretty and the food and coffee drinks feel so right and delicious. The patio is spacious, clean and a perfect place to study, go on a date, etc. I hope they never go away :)"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Food was good. Ambience us great! Staff awesome!
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Always lovely, even if we the customers are like ugh, such a drag... Lol. Really though great food, lovely outside area, parking in the area is ehh, but it's S.F. so whaddya expect..."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Lovely breakfast. Regular portions. Nice patio.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Open Seating. So the argument at the next table is only ignored with headphones. Difficult to dislike reverie. But they discourage working stiffs ie. No Wi-Fi. Reverie decided cash flow from parties who don't sit hours on end.is higher.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"The food was good and the garden patio is such a great little hideaway in the back. The prices are a little high, but not terrible for San Francisco."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Food used to be a lot better last year. Chicken plate had hummus and pita and vegetables. Now it’s just a regular spicy chicken.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Nice little Japanese garden for brunch. It’s quite popular and can be crowded. Nice food too.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Lovely patio but mediocre avocado toast and burnt coffee, especially for the price"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Surprisingly delicious Shakshuka and Breakfast Porridge--so far all I've had. Friendly, efficient staff. Always a good experience."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Ahi Tuna Avocado salad is great, though heavy on the red cabbage. No WiFi so don't come here for a working lunch."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Foods great! Employees are nice! They did not tell us about the condiments which you get from a shelf.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Affordable, tasty, diverse menu (hummus plate a great tide-over snack), chill (thanks Terrell), off the Haight bustle, wifi, and sweet backyard patio! Nothing more I could want."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Wonderful patio in the back.  Great casual coffee shop with good lunch choices.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Fantastic coffee and service. Vibes on point, will be coming here again."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Excellent breakfast and lunch options with a great backyard patio. You'll be amazed by what can come out of such a small kitchen.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Great coffee and good food. Has a nice outdoor seating area to enjoy weekend brunch in.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great breakfast place - the Hot Chocolate is amazing! Definitely the place to go for a delicious fresh breakfast, everything is made on site."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Surprisingly enjoyable find in Cole Valley. Diverse menu, friendly service, and a big and lovely back patio. Enjoy!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,it is very nice place to eat n enjoy . especialy the BOSS is good too.  I will try the TUNA SALAD one day. hope to c U there.  hahahahaha
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"Great place with a super nice patio. Menu is not expensive, and plates are good."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"We had coffee, tea and shared an eggplant and hummus plate in the garden! Very fresh and delicious!"
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Yummy food and nice service! I sat near the register and was truly convinced that the cashier knew each customer personally.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,It has good food from diverse cultures at reasonable prices and outside seating in a beautiful garden.
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,"A Cole Valley gem. Great coffee & menu, breakfast & lunch. Also has outdoor seating."
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Good job setting up the place to follow patio seating and social distancing. Beautiful Backyard!
Cafe Reverie,848 Cole St,Poached eggs hash - very tasty! Our friend enjoyed his jambalaya
