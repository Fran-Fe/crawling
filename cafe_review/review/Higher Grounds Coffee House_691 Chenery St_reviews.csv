Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,The coffee is good. The food was cooked perfectly and was tasty. Friendly service. I’d recommend. It’s a place to relax and be patient. Be kind when you show up and you’ll get a tasty experience.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Cash only. This place is a delight! I love the atmosphere, and the crepes! Definitely a highlight of Glen Park. Limited outdoor seating is available and it's in a fun location.  My favorite crepe is the shrimp. In addition to a lot of shrimp, it also has tomato sauce, tomato, mushroom, capers, garlic, spices, mozzarella cheese, and lemon. It is so tasty and I love the capers. Crepes come with a side of home style potatoes and a spring mix salad with a refreshing and light dressing."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"This is my kinda place to eat. Casual and delicious. We sat in the window seat and tried all the kinds of crepes. I had the Florentine. Nothing about it is fast, so take you time and eat slow. It’s worth it!!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"I love this place! One man runs it all, he is truly amazing. The food is delicious, coffee is great. Always enjoy the atmosphere. Cash only so come compared. Definitely a great breakfast spot. Always leave with a happy and full stomach."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"I love this Cafe, great quality nice coffee. Remember to have cash/Venmo when you get there."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"I highly recommend going to this place. The people there are all very friendly and the atmosphere is very light hearted. This place is a one man show, taking orders in the front, making food in the open kitchen and keeping up the coffee. The (presumable) owner runs the shop on his own, so the food does take a bit of time. The customers did not seem to mind though, all of them seeming to be understanding. If you're in a rush, this place is not for you.  I ordered to go, getting a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, and it was very good. The cheese was gooey and melted all over inside of the egg. The bacon bits were plentiful enough that each bite I took, there was always some in it. The bagel was toasted well and was a good vessel for the protein. All in all, a good experience and nice to see local shops doing very well. I would come back and get a sit down meal next time."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Terrific coffee, mixed blends and iced cafe au lait was so good!! Espresso single shot was good too. Shrimp crepe: liked the capers! Friendly owner ! Especially liked the rustic deco and various monthly art work from local artists."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Friendly, local, and tasty. check, check, and check. Manhal is just a pleasure to see every morning... The crepes are super popular with my kids!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Cute and cozy place, friendly staff, and delicious crepes… tomato sauce is amazing, the food feels homemade and healthy… highly recommend, it’ll be one of my go to places."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,So happy they are back open!! All of the ingredients are fresh and delicious. I've had most of the crepes on the menu and you really can't go wrong though my faves are the pesto and cannelloni. Cash only but there are atms just around the corner. I've lived in the bay for years and this is hands down my favorite place for brunch! Still just as delicious to go for lockdown.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,Left really upset and hungry. This man is running a business but didn't have his iPad out to check any door dash orders. I never got my food and had to leave empty-handed running late waiting 15 minutes to receive nothing
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"The place is very small, very busy, but very good. The coffee was absolutely incredible and there were so many omelettes! There were just 2 guys working, but they were hustling! Everything was amazing."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,It was recommended by the insured at my inspection and he told me to order the shrimp. At Higher Grounds I told the person (owner?) that I am celiac so he suggested that he put the shrimp into omelette. OMG!!!! My husband had it in a crepe and said it was the best crepe he'd ever had. This is our new go to when in San Francisco. Also the cappuccino was amazing.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Amazing crepes, good coffee, very nice people. One of the best places to go for breakfast or lunch in Glen Park. I recommend the curry crepe for a savory lunch, and one of the fruit crepes for a sweet breakfast."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Lovely old school joint, pulled off by a single talented employee, with a pot of tea and good coffee. Outdoor oarklet available."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"An institution. Nothing compares. Small homey place. Everything made right in front with top notch fillings and endless options. The best savory crepes in the city, no doubt.  Favorites include the salsa crepe, the pesto crepe (add chicken!), and the florentine. Hand crafted espressos and iced tea. Lots more.  One important note- they only accept cash."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,The crepes were amazing!
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Higher Grounds has become so special to me that I've celebrated two consecutive birthdays here simply to feel at home. The sole owner is also the server/cook/overall problem solver (he also owns two other businesses on the same block). This man is focused, a little introverted, and pushes out 10/10 crepes amazingly.  Higher Grounds is a must-try if you have time around Daly City."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Really nice authentic vibe, delicious coffee & food, one man operation so if it's busy expect to wait a bit, but he handled it very well, was efficient and extremely nice!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Very cozy little coffee shop. I had a bagel with cream cheese and tomato along with a Mexican hot chocolate. Both good.  No credit cards accepted yet (the owner said that might be coming), but they accept cash or Venmo, so you still have options."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Incredible food and a friendly staff. It was fun having such good food and service in a simple, inviting spot. Highly recommend the French toast!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Had the Alla Milanese crepe, which was delicious! The mocha was a generous portion, but not very rich."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,Cute if a bit rustic. Food is pretty good and decor is charming. Pricing is reasonable. Needs a little modernization and would benefit from additional space; such is city life. Simplicity can be a workable vibe though.
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,Soooo goood!!!! Only thing is its so busy so you should wait probably a while
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Darn— our coffee was really a bummer! Ambiance was lovely, as was the location, but this won’t be our stop for lattes in the future 😢 …"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Stopped in to this blast from the past. It’s not a coffee shop (the name is misleading) but it is an awesome brunch spot with tons of crepe options. If I lived here, I’d be a regular."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"It was great going back yesterday!! It was so much cleaner than before!! I’m happy they are doing some outdoor dining but I wish they had indoor dining. Oh well. 25% capacity won’t do it. Maybe 50% or when it becomes 100% which will be like a year from now depending on what happens. Anyway enough politics I’m glad it’s reopened and the hot chocolate I’ve been getting since I was a child tastes just the same so I’m happy! If you haven’t, come in by, some of the best crepes in the city. Maybe the best in the Bay Area?!"
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,Super cozy cafe with great breakfast sandwiches!
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Went on a Glenn park exploration day and a friend of mine recommended to try this place. She specifically mentioned to get the chicken crepe and it was good advice because the crepe was good... Just good not excellent, I think that the dish was missing something but overall I liked the taste and ate it all :) I didn't wait at all to get my crepe and it was brought to my table directly (you need to order at the counter). Overall the staff is very nice and my experience was positive."
Higher Grounds Coffee House,691 Chenery St,"Fantastic crepes. I got the Salsa Crepe which was loaded with incredibly flavorful tomatoes, avocados, and olives. The side potatoes and salad were delicious as well. The one man cashier/cook was quiet but nice and very polite. Would definitely come again!"
