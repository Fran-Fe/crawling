Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Laidback coffee shop that’s good for studying. Came here for a quick breakfast while waiting for laundry to finish and it was a chill vibe. You order at the counter and pay, and then they’ll call out each order. I got the matcha latte (oat milk is available for an extra charge) along with the breakfast burrito (they’re pre-made so they’ll hand it right to you). The burrito is vegetarian. There is Tapatio by the trash/recyclable station. The avocado toast comes with a lot of avocado and is also vegetarian. Credit cards accepted."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,What a cool laid back coffee shop this is. Great coffee and small cakes etc FREE WiFi A few crafts n art for sale. You gotta try it if you like good coffee.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Beacon is my go-spot in the area for a cappuccino and pastry. The staff is friendly and the space has a great vibe. It’s also a lovely place to buy a gift, as they have a beautifully curated selection of books, puzzles, candles, etc."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,I would not recommend their espresso/milk drinks. I've ordered 10+ cappuccinos (to go) over the past few months and each time the micro-foam is lacking or missing entirely and the whole milk tastes like oat milk.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I am a local and live down the street from this establishment and am reluctant to go here again as this place is very overpriced for the quality. No problem paying $10 for a breakfast burrito but when it's literally looks and tastes like it came from a gas station, it's probably a sign. Better off going to any of the neighboring cafes as they have good food and run by people who actually care about their businesses."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Good coffee and good quality tea. Friendly staff and cosy place.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Perfect after an early school pick up coffee and bite place. Friendly people and beautiful spaces.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Pros Nice decor and airy ambience. Excellent latte. Tasty breakfast burrito. Different seating options. Free WiFi.  Con Can be quite hot even in the morning- large windows facing the sun but no air conditioning.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Great coffee (very underwhelming croissant) and cute space. You are suggested to cap laptop work here at 2h without an additional purchase.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"An unsupposing neighbourhood coffee shop with a bright New England nautical theme diluted to a more palatable non-theme park look and feel. Copious space allows for people working from laptops connected to the free and fast WiFi while looking out of the large windows that allow light to flood into the open plan space. It’s enjoyable quiet (in as far as coffee shops can be) with bags of warm character.  The cold brew is strong with a slight bitter after taste in a generous portion by European standards. The selection of juices are novel including a Boss Tonic and Mermaid Lemonade.  The service is fast, engaging and friendly.  Would I come back? Definitely. I would be so lucky as to have this as my local coffee shop.  #juice #coffee #coldbrew #sanfrancisco"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I love this coffeeshop! Coffee and eats are great. The space is airy and light, very comfortable. Best part are the friendly baristas and good vibes. I'll be coming back often. They also have a fantastic selection of crafts, sauces and snacks for purchase."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Nice coffee bar, with on of the best cappuccinos I have had in a very long time. Also nice and spacious. Definitely a place where I could work from for a day"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,This a great place to work from. There are plenty plug points and there is wifi. The neighbourhood is always very quiet and the coffee is pretty good.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"A great coffee place, tastey espresso drinks and top notch pastries, from Firebrand bakery up in Oakland, if I remember correctly. Good food otherwise, now open inside with seats and wifi, open doors to Columbus Ave and tidy interior."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Ordered a quad red eye. Got charged for it but given a large coffee that was mediocre. Mocha and lattes for my partners were described as lackluster. Don’t worry. I will never be back.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Love this coffeeshop! The staff is super friendly, and they make the best lattes in North Beach. Their covid-conscious take out only operation, with a big table in their doorway, has opened up into a vibrant rebirth, with new decor in a green and pink earthy pallet, new stocks of local crafts and dry goods, and even better coffee from local roasters Grand Coffee."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Amazing staff, amazing food, very chill and welcoming. A little pricey but SUCH GOOD QUALITY. Would highly recommend."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"A good place for lattes, wifi, and the quintessential coffee shop atmosphere. There's lots of natural light, a decent amount of seating, and a bunch of areas to explore nearby.  I'd say the prices are comparable to others in the area (and as such, SF coffee prices), but I much prefer this place for the venue itself."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"This place has sort of fallen out of its original glory. It serves amazing coffee, but is still only a take out window with very short and inconvenient hours. Not to mention the staff can be a little standoff ish. I used to love coming here and sitting inside and it was a great modern coffee shop. Now, the neighborhood has lots of other great options for 3rd wave coffee shops with better hours and cafe seating, and I hate to say it but I never find myself coming here anymore. Even when I do, it’s usually after the 2pm closing time. Hopefully management makes some changes soon so that they don’t get left behind, as the rest of the neighborhood has rapidly recovered from COVID."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Delicious coffee and incredible pastries, but the staff seems bothered by my mere existence when I come to order. They did a huge remodel and I was excited to hopefully see a lot of seating availability rather than the take-out window, but instead they just added a paltry counter seating option. I’m not sure what that massive space in the center of the shop is for, would be optimal for table seating in my opinion."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Yummy iced golden milk, very friendly staff, wifi, available seating, clean, and airy. Nice view of Coit Tower if you're near a window, and also right next to all the action of the park and the quiet of the library. BE HERE!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Lovely coffee shop. Staff was very friendly and the coffee and oatmeal were excellent!
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Coffee, Chai, light lunch, all taken care of in a friendly and efficient operation. Atmosphere and decor just right."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Good place and great service. Pour over is a good price but doesn't taste that great even for the natural Ethiopian. They do serve food here e.g. avocado toast.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great coffee, strong wifi, quite a number of sockets if you need power, friendly service and good pastries. A great place to get some work done, lots of light. However space is limited."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Good matcha latte 👍 I added sugar on top.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I went with the expectation of it being open for dine in, unfortunately not. They have a bench outside but pretty crowded since only one. Other than that standard Lavender Iced Oat Latte. Service was nice and quick for it being busy."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Great local spot and coffee is a 10!  Staff so nice too :)
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Friendly staff, good pastries. Will be back for their coffee.  *Update: went back to Beacon Coffee & Pantry.  Again, great service.  They consistently have good service/ friendly staff.  Was nice to let me put in an order of coffee minutes before closing.  Good Cortado and the lady before me commented that their latte is delicious.  Will be going back soon again."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Perfect cappuccino’s every time :) Lots of natural light & a very friendly staff. So much better than the chain coffee shops
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Excellent local coffee made by excellent staff who are very knowledgeable and friendly.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Cute cafe and nice staff but the matcha latte and cider we ordered were both pretty watery.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"My favorite coffee shop in San Fran! Fantastic espresso. Croissant was amazing and so was the breakfast burrito. No dine in right now, you simply order at the window. There was quite a line on Sunday morning but it went fast."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Chill local hub. Liked that when I ordered a cappuccino, it wasn’t a massive cup half filled with milk. I come for the caffeine. It was fun to feel like a local and run here in the mornings. Breakfast burrito is good as well. Made every morning."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Customer on Sat July 17th 2021. Got a latte to-go. It was $5 plus gratuity. The review is solely on the latte, since they didn't have any indoor seating. There were 3 employees inside the shop. The coffee was good but the latte was too milky.  Unfortunately, this was the only decent place around. But won't be coming back here."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Stopped here to grab a coffee while we waited for our laundry to finish down the street. Coffee was excellent. Didn’t look like they were allowing indoor seating.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"IMO the best cafe in North Beach. Much of what they offer is made from high quality ingredients. In the before times, was also a very solid place to sit down and get some work done.  A nice bonus - a few doors down is a very cool alfa romeo/porsche mechanic’s shop that always gets me to pause and admire."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I had the vanilla latte with oat milk. Sweet but not too sweet. Wish I could've made it there before they ran out of blueberry scones, but I was satisfied with the coffee."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Lovely cafe with good sandwiches and Matcha latte. Sandwiches come with delicious Ciabatta bread.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great avocado toast. It's expensive but a huge slab of sourdough with generous amount of avocado. Coffee is four barrels - personally I think too tart and overrated but each to their own so won't count that as a negative. Would love a few vegan pastry items on the menu.  Update: last 4 times I have been, they had run out of bread so minus a star as I haven't been able to eat there for the past month."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"We had the Breakfast Burrito, avocado toast, parfait and a croissant. All very good."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I live near by, even there's tons of cafe' near by but Beacon is my favorite! The location is great also nice service!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Pretty standard coffee shop in SF that uses coffee beans from Andytown roastery. I got an almond milk cappuccino which was decent,  good but nothing special. Besides espresso drinks, they also have a few different pourover options and tea for non-coffee drinkers. The overall ambience is really great though, there is enough room to sit down and relax. Baristas were all super friendly and quick with service."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"There were a number of people waiting, but they got through the line quickly. We got lattes, iced and hot, plus a ham and cheese croissant. Would recommend both!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I walked in looking for good coffee to wrap up my day. Asked if I could use their restroom. I understand businesses don't want non customers to use their restrooms. The counter lady's response was a little rude I felt. And I am fine if by buying their coffee, I am paying for the use of restroom. But the restroom wasn't maintained. No paper towels, paper lying around. Long story short, I could have been dealt with nicely and I wouldn't be writing my thoughts!!!!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Unfriendly staff and basic, unimpressionable coffee for the price. I was expecting to have some delicious 3rd wave coffee, but this place is pretty disappointing. I ordered a cortado with Almond milk for here and they put it in a Togo cup. My cortado was full of bubbles and no latte art! They don't dry their portafilter basket before pulling shots and they don't wipe their steam wand after steaming milk. I'm a coffee person, so I'm attuned to excellence; this place is definitely not that. I gave them two starts instead of one just because the shop looks nice from the outside."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"I predict this place won't last long. Why? Because, as far as I can tell, every policy, every choice they make, is for the convenience of the business and not the customer. No avocado toast before 11? Why, exactly? No triple shot drinks? Closed at 2:00 on July 4? Won't use gluten-free bread even though they have it available? Forgot to include avocado on a salad and instead of adding it after the fact for free to make up for the inconvenience, charging the customer separately for it? Epic fail. Decent coffee, pretty good food, lousy service, mediocre space. Give it a pass."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great coffee shop. I ordered a PNG pourover and a scone and it was exactly what I expected. Environment is clean, wasn't busy at the time (10-ish Sunday), good service. Worth your time if you're looking for a good cup of coffee and a snack while you visit the City."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"This place has an aesthetic and vibrancy that plays on the subtlety of the tourism in North Beach but caters to the locals and San Franciscans. The coffee is good, selections of foods and home goods is interesting, and the people there are nicer than would be expected from third wave coffee shops."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"This place just started carrying four barrel coffee, so I thought I would give them another try since I live nearby, and I am glad I did. In stark contrast to the dickish hipster barista vibe I got so often in the past, I found the staff not only welcoming and friendly, but they also know how to pull good shots with consistency. This has become my go-to for north beach now. =)"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Nice coffee a little bit out of the noisy and crowded central areas of the city. Staff is always attentive and even though I only use while I was visiting the city on business trips, the team pays enough attention to recognise you, your name and your preferences."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Good coffees and healthy lunch options - we had the chia pudding and granola parfait. Both very tasty and good portions.  Tip: go for take out and eat it in Joe DiMaggio playground if you have kids. Our son loved it. Then you will also evade sitting next to dozens of people staring at their laptops and not being sure whether it is ok if your infant is making some sounds while playing
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Overall, it seems like your cute and cozy coffee shop.And I'm usually not one to complain but the chai latte was not chai at all. It's more of milk with grainy spices (that you can't taste) at the bottom which makes it very unpleasant to drink. Maybe just stick to the coffee.  Unfortunately, I felt as if I were intruding on a conversation with the cashiers when I placed my order. So customer service didn't compensate for the sub par drink."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Really great coffee and a genuine smile. A rare treat these days it seems. Cool place and laid back vibe. Didn't eat anything, but the food looked good. Will definitely be returning."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great ambiance, good place to chill and work.  Coffee was quite tasty, mostly on the dark chocolaty side of the spectrum (but still focusing on pourovers... ?  SF :P. The Rwanda was my favorite"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great coffee shop in North Beach; one of my favorites in the area. Modern and busy atmosphere. Small food menu, good coffee and decent prices. Across the street from public library."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Had breakfast burritos and they were flavorless. Potatoes had no flavor. Customer service not friendly. Price good.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Totally disappointed. I love coffee. I read coffee blogs. Sightglass is incredible coffee and the SOMA location is awesome, but this place brings shame to the name.  Today I walk in around noon to get some reading done and grab some espresso. There's a long line and I'm still riding high from my morning coffee so I grab a seat put my headphones in and start working. After about 15 minutes one of the guys behind the counter comes over and asks me if he can get me anything. I reply that I'm gonna wait for a bit and then order. He walks away, heads back to work and life goes on. I think to myself .. 'what great service this place has that he would come up and check on me.'  5 minutes later same guy walks up to me and taps the counter next to me to get my attention. I take my headphones off and he tells me, ""you're gonna have to order something or get out. It's getting full. I have water for $1."" ... Seriously??? I could stay if I pay $1?  Forget this place, I'm upset. whatever if you don't recognize me from the last 30 times I came in but really you're gonna hustle me? This is a coffee shop and both seats next to me are empty as is a seat down the row and one at the end of the counter. I'm not tryin' to get hustled by my coffee shop.  With so much competition in North Beach it's easy to make the decision to avoid this place.  I'm sticking with Cafe Trieste and Stella pastry."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Exploring the area and saw Beacon coffee, decided to get a coffee and chill for half an hour. Once the lady passed me the coffee, she told me the shop is closing in 3 mins. It would be great if she let me know before"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"When I have my heart set, it’s hard to tell it otherwise. Even if it means a 15 minutes walk up a hill during my lunch break… for coffee. Thankfully my coworkers were down. We passed the strip clubs (and did not collect), weaved through Chinatown, and dodged the tourists of North Beach before finally arriving at Beacon Coffee and Pantry. Much to my disappointment, the reason for my visit, the vertical succulent garden was covered in painters plastic! We still loved our coldbrews, our cortados, and our grilled cheese. And there’s no denying that the light from the windows, the subway tile and the diagonal hardwood floor was gorgeous. But deep down, I needed the complete picture. A couple weeks after our first visit, we journeyed back. That garden – worth the thigh burn."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,The place and nice and comfortable. Their coffee have a unique distintive taste that is slightly more acidic than most coffee in the market. Price is reasonable. A nice place to relax and drink.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great coffee, but at some point they prepared something in there that the smell made my eyes tear a lot. Also, the wifi just stopped working out of the blue. 👀 …"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"You'll love this spacious, modern place if you love Sightglass Coffee and you like to read or work on laptops. Beacon has the coffee, outlets, wifi and quiet that you'll enjoy. Food is limited, though they have shelves of non-perishables from where you can stock up for your pantry."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"All I want out of a good coffee shop is a regular cup of coffee, not pour-over or French press, just the basic brewed coffee. Beacon uses San Francisco's local Sightglass coffee. Grab a cup from them -- it's delicious!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Great coffee and veggie burritos. Coffee is very smooth and the staff is friendly. The almond milk in lattes is also quite good.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"They have almond milk as an option (one of the few places in SF that do), sightglass coffee, free wifi, friendly staff, they accept cards, it's trendy, great lighting because of the big windows that view Columbus Street, and it's a great place to do some work."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Five stars for the granola parfait that mysteriously appeared on my table😂 But seriously, it is a very nice place with quite descent prices, and good coffee (usually go for macchiato here). …"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Coffe is just amazing and the spacious place will give you a great relaxed time. The food is not that great... I had a Breakfast burrito and to be hones it looked better than it tasted... Anyway the place is really good
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Barista was not interested to talk. My espresso was in a little paper cup with a spoon. But espresso was good since it was sightglass beans. It's close to the north beach public library.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"This is the best coffee I’ve ever had. Also, great atmosphere and service. Make a point to stop in if you are visiting San Francisco."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Lovely decor - very clean setting and lots of macbook wielding types. The coffee was okay and my yoghurt / granola dish was very tasty (but on the small side).
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"The cashier said croissants were fresh, but in fact they were super dry and not edible. When I brought it up after I bought it, I just got ignored."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Sightglass beans, so they're starting from a good spot. Sometimes get snarky service, sometimes good; depends on the day crew working. Can also be hit or miss regarding quality of drinks prepared."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Unlike the hipster coffee shops found in the likes of SoMa and Hayes Valley, Beacon is a bit more traditional. Distinguishable indie rock, coffee beans from SoMa's own Sightglass, and the difficult to come by free SF WiFi. Solid coffee, and great cookies!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Really great coffee, especially if you want to escape the Italian homogeneity of north beach coffee."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Very nice iced chai latte, but I wish they had seating.  Even a few limited seats would be appreciated :)"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Can't beat Beacon's swag really. This cafe adds a unique twist to North Beach's already diverse group of cafes. Beacon has its owns style and a friendly group of folks serving the best coffee ever!
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,We came Sunday morning and took the seats at the windows facing the street. It was great. Very light and modern decorations. Casual place.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"delish breakfast burrito! baaad matcha latte. pale green color, was mostly milk"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Alexis and her staff are amazing. Breakfast Burrito and Avacado on toast are to die for in my book... 5star for sure!! Thanks guys for always giving great service...🧡 …
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Went here a couple of times during our holiday. The coffee is good but the amount of people on laptops is really oppressing. Makes it difficult to get a seat
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Good Place with Wifi and Perfect Coffee
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Coffee is good.  Unfortunately,  all cups here are to go EVEN WHEN YOU STAY to have your coffee.  Wish they would show more concern for the environment."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Awesome veggie quiche and great coffee, friendly staff too! New favorite in north beach."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Good coffee simple selection of tastey breakfast, super friendly service! Right across from dylan's bike tours if you happen to be doing that while you're in rhe area!"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"It was okay.  Service could have been better.   I felt like we were bothering the young lady behind the counter.   Sure, I get it, I'm a tourist, but customer service is part of the job."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Beacon Coffee is conveniently located, has a great decor and atmosphere, and perfect coffee. If I lived in San Francisco, I would be in here every day if I could."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great iced coffee, and delicious food to go with. Unfortunately,  you can't enjoy the ambiance of the interior decor"
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Average coffee, miserable staff, no atmosphere. Full of people using the WiFi. Staff need training in how to smile and say hi/bye etc. Rather give my money to someone else."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Amazing cup of coffee. There were a lot of people working here on their Macbooks which, unfortunatly, did not contribute to the atmosphere. You are ought to be silent."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Consistently good coffee and specialty drinks in a laid back, comfortable atmosphere. Light breakfast and lunch food is not bad, either."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,"Great spot to get some work done.  Coffee is good, stay away from the food items.  They are premade and not that well done."
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Avocado toast is great here. Very little seating though! Two restrooms available to customers.
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,805 Columbus Ave,Had a quick stop here while exploring San Francisco.  Didn't get to stay long as they were closing.   Nice place close to the cable cars.
