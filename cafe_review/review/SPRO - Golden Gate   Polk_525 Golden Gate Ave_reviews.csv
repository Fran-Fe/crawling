SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,Very beautiful latte art and atmosphere. Very close convenient location and nice staff. A good way to start a morning and great place to work or read.
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"None of their interior pictures are accurate to what The place looks like inside.  I had a jury duty and another jury suggested going to the cafeteria inside the court house.  I suggested going to this place because of all the 5 star reviews.  I was dead wrong.  I should have read the actual reviews and it looks like those are fake reviews written by friends and family.  I ordered a Salmon sandwich and all I got was a piece of Salmon with no bread and a spoonful of Sweet peas.   The coffee is 90% milk. I've read some of the reviews including their other stores.  The owner is a very hateful person. He verbally attacks reviewers who leave negative comments instead of apologizing and try to improve their service. The worse of all... Their store sign blocks most of sidewalk ramp.  They are despicable, inconsiderate and disrespectful store I've seen in my life.  The fact that they think their store sign is more important that it needs to block the handicap ramp for the disabled and senior citizens like myself."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"The food is great, and the menu has tons of options. Good coffee as well. The service is spectacular and is where this place truly shines. They are just a coffee shop but the staff went above and beyond my expectations. Providing me water while I worked without me asking. The perfect place to do remote work . I only wish they had more comfy chairs."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"One of the best coffee shops near S.F. City Hall.  Amazing staffs service and open space which was excellent for chatting with my friends. I had ordered a cup of mocha with less honey, its taste was just perfect. The blueberry muffin was so yummy and not over sweet. I definitely will visit again with my friends to try their smoothies and the Tokyo Rose green tea. My friend who ordered this was highly recommended"
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Great new addition and revival to the TL neighborhood! These guys take this business seriously and when it comes to good brew and food I appreciate that. It shows in the quality, flavor and presentation. So far everything I've had has been delicious. I'll definitely be a regular here trying most of the items I've seen on the menu."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Great coffee and people, they made accommodations for my drink and offered a little sample of the fifty shades for me. Would definitely recommend! It’s Spro good!"
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,I have been going to SPRO for 5 years now and haven’t been disappointed one time. I have been to all 3 cafes and the coffee and food are the best in the city and the people are even more amazing. Kind and genuine and really know what they are doing. I have watched their business grow over the years and I hope they continue to grow because San Francisco needs more businesses like this one.
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Worse Coffee shop in the city. I had the matcha Latte and its mostly milk.  I basically paid $7 for a cup of milk.  My friend on the other hand had a Strawberry field, she had it worse.  The drink was consist of 90% ice.  The first reviews clearly written by the owners.  I'm surprised Google is okay with that."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"I've been visiting the other two locations for a while now. This place nails the art of craft coffee (this is coming from a fellow barista). Pour overs are my thing, but their different matchas are also sooo good. I've also never had one of their pastries that I didn't adore. I'm glad there's a closer location I can get to now."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Spro is a must if you live or work in the area! The delicious food and pastries they offer is made in house, the coffee served is always rotating and unique in flavor with a menu that caters to all coffee drinkers! Whether you prefer a simple drink or have a sweet tooth the barista will help find what you’re looking for! I’d recommend the island hop and the Japanese egg sandwich  ;)"
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"It's nice coffee and the taste is great, but their a bit pricey for the food you're getting. Overall, ok coffee store to pop into for a pick-me-up"
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,Truly one of the best coffee shops in the city. The consistency with their pour overs is unparalleled.
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"The Madagascar is my favorite drink. Little sweet, creamy and enough caffeine  for me. Feeling little hungry? Try the mash-up with bacon! Friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Tried their Havana sandwich and mardi gras drink, the sandwich was really good with their special in house sauce and drink had a really nice hint of cane sugar. Would recommend to give it a try"
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Had smoked salmon sandwich and hojicha here, they were both really good. Especially that hojicha, whoever loves japanese tea should def give it a try."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"So glad SPRO Coffee is in the TL/Civic Center.  With all the closures happening, this is a welcomed addition to this neighborhood.  Today (7/17/23) was their grand opening.  They had a selection of complimentary drinks and pastries, including a ""cookie of the hour.""  My coworkers and I shared the brown butter chocolate chip cookie, the ube oatmeal cookie, and the confetti cookie.  All were delicious!  One of the to-go sandwiches that caught my eye was the Japanese egg salad sando.  But they ran out during the lunch rush so it must be good.  As for the drinks, I had the iced Spice Island coffee, which had cayenne pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and dark chocolate.  It was so delicious!  The spice wasn't overpowering and it complimented the chocolate.  The space they occupy is the first floor of the city's PUC building.  There are a few tables and chairs to sit.  It can get loud there if there's a lot of people.  I hope the building turns on the screens.  It used to be a moving mural of how water is pumped from Hetch Hetchy.  The people who work there are extremely nice and definitely held it together under pressure, especially during the fire alarm!  I will definitely come back to try more of their items. I plan on getting a breakfast burrito tomorrow, but I am eyeing one of those pastry pillows or mochi waffles.  And I will have to get a tres leches cake as well."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"The guy in front of me had a full course of explanation of  the menu, even got recommendation of what's the preferred drink for the summer.  I asked  the a similar question and all I got was ""we serve coffee and the menu is on the wall behind me"""
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"As a regular patron of the first two Spro locations, I am ecstatic to see a third Spro in SF. Easily winning the title of best espresso in San Francisco, Spro serves creative specialty coffee and fine plates and pastries— something for every craving. Their staff is a joy and the ambiance of the cafe always makes for a great morning or afternoon."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,Psyched to see a local business and the best coffee in town now with a third location.
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,Food and drinks were so tasty!! It was popping when I was in there so I couldn't get a seat but overall great experience here. They really show they care about their coffee!
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"Lovely creative coffee menu and a wide variety of food options. I’ve been here a few times now and they’ve been consistently delicious. I loved the bread pudding, the Hong Kong milk tea and the cookies the most. This time I got the bacon and egg pillow and I think the drink was called Madagascar, a latte with vanilla and muscovado sugar the pastry was great and well seasoned, coffee was well balanced and not too sweet."
SPRO - Golden Gate   Polk,525 Golden Gate Ave,"This is one of the best cafes in the bay area! I tried most of their drinks and they're all amazing. I highly recommend this place!  If you are visiting or living in San Fran, if you are looking for a delicious cafe or coffee, I recommend this place! There is a second store next to Dolores Park, so it's good to look around the park while drinking coffee!"
