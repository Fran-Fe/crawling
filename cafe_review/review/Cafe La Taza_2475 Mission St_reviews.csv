Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Great for a large group that included kids. Big portions for adults, small plates for the kids. Coffee, juice, adult breakfast beverages. House potatoes are great! Everything came out fast, service was friendly and very tolerant of the kids."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"It is a wonderful place everyone is very friendly, food is delicious, coffee it's awesome, juice is fresh, mimosas are good. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Had high hopes for this place because the reviews are so good. It ends up being a little underwhelming. Ordered the tres leches pancakes and classic breakfast with scrambled eggs and chicken sausage. Pancakes are decent. The tres leches sauce is really sweet but is a pretty good sub for maple syrups. The scrambled eggs and chicken sausage are pretty awful. scrambled eggs are hard and flavourless. Chicken sausage is so burned that it's barely eatable. I don't think the place is bad. Maybe i just ordered the wrong stuff.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Came here for breakfast with the family one day during vacation, the food was really good and seasoned great for breakfast grub, but the service was awful! Waiter forgot one of our meals, coffee was brought super late and never refilled once, we were charged for stuff we never ordered, we were stopped at the door when someone thought we didn't pay and wanted to charge us a 2nd time, BLAH! What a drag, the food was good and it would have been nice to come back the next day but not after that service."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I love coming here for the tres leches pancakes!They are fluffy and they do not need syrup, the tres leches creme is so good and enough to moisten the pancakes! The chilaquiles are also good, red chilaquiles are a little spicier, which is how they should be, but not everyone is used to it. Prices are decent and staff is awesome."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"We absolutely love this place. Their food can be a little too spicy, but their Mexican café mocha & chocolate frappé are to die for, as is their fresh squeezed orange juice. Friendly staff. So glad to have them in our neighborhood!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Solid brunch spot. Full bar for breakfast cocktails. A lot of single use condiments which made dining during the pandemic feel manageable. Indoor and outdoor dining available. The servers were kind and made us feel safe
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,So many options and great service! Everything is fresh and delicious. You'll love this place. Highly recommended.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Was able to share some margaritas with my two sons they have a wonderful courtyard in the back
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Food in here is delicious. it just sometimes feels a bit crawed. The service is always on point, I definitely recommend this place."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,This spot is a local favorite. Coffee is excellent! You can stop by alone for coffee and a quick bite or meet a colleague for a breakfast meeting. Cafe La Taza is great for both.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I have so many good memories about this place. Food is not wat it used to be, and service is just sad.."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,I used to with Mom to eat there a lot n there's new pl working now n service was terrible..first never come to the table to refill water o ask if everything was k..then we ordered something that we thought was different n then we asked for cheese omelette n bacon only n the brought something completely different n we got charged for the first plate that we didn't have it n the answer from the waiter was rude ..definitely disappointed n we no coming back again..oh the table next to us was also having issues with the order...definitely was no good experience
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"This place is absolutely authentic. You'll find a great fusion in latin american delicatessen dishes. When you arrive let the staff you'll be dining in, and to order their special coffee or latte you'll need to choose from behind the counter since they don't have then on the menu. Staff is very helpful and polite."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Fantastic food. Great service. If I lived in San Francisco, this would be one of my go-to's."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,I was really surprised by how good the food was especially for the price! Everything was cooked well and really flavorful! Definitely coming back to this place. Need to explore the rest of the menu and drink menu.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Very good food, excellent service, very warm welcoming place I’ve been going for years and I can’t say I’ve ever been dissapointed"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Been going here for years and so glad im back again. In the middle of my more favorite areas in my hometown of San Francisco! Lets support small and continue that awesome road to community recovery post pandemic!
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Great service, ordered pollo al Horno, good flavor but chicken was over cooked.  Nice cocktails!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Best homemade ginger ale & lemonade. Pollo saltado w yuca & the best sauce to ""chuparse los dedos"". La Taza salad  was crunchy fresh w a very smooth, creamy & flavorful dressing. Place is clean. Service is quick & personnel is very attentive. Love the Old NYC salsa!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Super yummy breakfast!  Will definitely go back and try lunch/happy hour. Go, you won't be sorry. Bacon cheddar omelette and french toast are both a 10."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"One of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had; under 6 bucks, made fresh and served fast."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Excellent food, amazing service!  Recently discovered this place, it’s now our go-to for watching the 9ers/Giants games. Awesome food served by one of the most friendly staff! Highly recommend"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"We’re from out of town. So a local who grew up around the corner recommended La Taza for breakfast.  We were glad we listened to her.  Superb Afro-Caribbean music accompanied an excellent Oaxacan omelette. We split it and were plenty full. The omelette relied on three cheeses, each one appearing in order on the tongue. Add in tomatoes of three types, plus tomatillos in a pepper sauce, with baby red potatoes in thyme and you have a great meal.  Be sure to try the Café Mocha with Mexican chocolate, with just a hint of cinnamon to pierce the rich chocolate."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Everything I've had here has been amazing. Drool worthy. I both love and hate that it's so close to me. Their rancheros sauce is spicy, sinus and soul cleansingly so. They always get my egg order right and I'm particular.  When they're busy, service can be a bit slower, but everyone is unfailingly kind and engaging. They're a hopping spot so just go into it with appropriate expectations and you'll have a 5 star experience.  Thanks for the yummy eats and tasty coffee.💗"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"It's has the best sweet potato fries and chicken sandwich which is so , so good and the staff is top-notch an excellent and clean place 👍😋 …"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,The corned beef meal was not good for my taste buds.  Fatty corned beef.  My friend liked her pork ribs.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"""Excellent!""  The Food and Service is usually always good, also their Chai is Super!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Great selection of food at a fair price. The place is clean and the dishes are presentable.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Been there few times, and so far good experience."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Nice little spot on 21st mission st. Variety of dishes 👌 Nicaraguan, Peruvian, Mexican. We had breakfast (plato tipico from Nicaragua) it was really good if you like Gallo pinto which is rice and beans mixed with fried pork. My dad had scrambled eggs with chorizo, also very good 👍."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Very good salmon plate for one of us and other plate of shrimp and rice , Nicaraguan style with veggies and plantain sides for another one of us. Restaurant clean and prices very reasonable. Staff friendly and helpful."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Nice little breakfast spot, and the coffee is delicious 😋"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"The food is very good, the attention, the service, everything is very good."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"The food was delicious, the outside dining space was great, and the service was fantastic! Eva was great and never let us feel like she had forgotten about us when we were the only people dining outside and inside was pretty busy. Thank you Eva!!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Great place!! Delicious food... 100% recommendations 👍🏼 …
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I am biased because I am close but this place is nearly a perfect cafe to visit. Great for just getting a Mexican Mocha and doing work, for getting an egg and cheese bagel with a friend in the morning or getting a salad in the evening. Sometimes the music can be a touch too loud, but otherwise I feel lucky to have such an amazing cafe nearby."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I’ve been coming here for years and La Taza has never disappointed. The food is incredible, I personally recommend the chilaquiles verde. Coffee wonderful and the fresh squeezed orange juice is a must have. Service is great everyone is very kind and accommodating."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"It’s got to be the only Mexican restaurant with NO house Salsa :/  I just don’t understand I weak up this morning Looking to get a warm and delicious breakfast and by the time food arrived I ask d for Hot Salsa and they give me this cheap xxxxxxhot bottle , if I knew I would have bought my Herdez guacamole sauce"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Too loud, coffee was over roasted and service was just Ok"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"The ambiance was delightful and the waitress were extremely welcoming and courteous! The food was Delicious!!! I had the grilled chicken with avocado...it was the Bomb💣!!!! I have to admit the prices were a little high, but still worth the taste and flavor! My friends had salads and they enjoyed them tremendously! Try it you will like it!😍😍😍"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Great food, ambience and the best Tres Leches (dessert)...100% recommendable"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I really loved the waitresses and the waiter's attitudes and actions. They were very funny, beautiful, and polite. The place was, besides, a very nice place to visit. Hanging out and relaxing was trendy, tidy, and precise. I've always really liked this coffee shop. Uh, thanks!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Cornbeef hash off the hook Great♡
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Just asked Google for food near me and found this place. It was hoping. Service was quick, friendly and the place was nice and clean. I don't prefer such loud music in the morning so that wasn't good for me. I didn't notice any vegan options.  Things are pretty pricey  I had an omelet with black beans and toast and coffee. The omelet was very good. Blacks beans needed more seasoning.  Coffee made due. I would definitely drop in again if need to kill time again."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Today the red chilaquiles was a bomb! Delicious cause the were spicy 😆 scramble eggs smell didn't really like eggs at all .
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,I ordered an A Denver omelette. The taste was horrible the Omelette wasnt properly cook and the potatoes had no flavor the potatoes tasted like they were cooked last week. I wish I could get my money back. Do not recommend.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Had the breakfast burrito, was good. Bloody Mary was okay and to salty. I might go back to try something else on the menu and give the bloody mary another try as it seems the were lacking staff that day"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"My wife and I were walking around the neighborhood looking for a good brunch menu and the majority of places were either too pricey or just did not offer what we were looking for. We stopped in front of Cafe La Taza and briefly looked at the posted menu. It looked perfect for what we were craving. It's been a few years since I stepped inside and it seems the place remodeled since. There is now a full bar and it seems they've added more seating. Plus the decor looks more modern. The staff were friendly and attentive. The portions of food were great and cooked perfectly. (Nothing worse than over cooked Eggs Benedict.) I originally ordered an El Niño, which is a mimosa with Tequila and grenadine, but although it looked and tasted good, should have just ordered a regular mimosa as it is more than twice the serving size and costs less. Will definitely go back and explore the rest of the menu."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Great food,service, and ambiance. This is not one of those pretentious hipster spots with waiters that sport suspenders with tweed caps and well-coiffed mustaches. Its a neighborhood cafe that is frequented by both the new and old residents of the Mission. Aside from good coffee, you can get freshly squeezed juices. Their menu has something for everyone, whether you want breakfast, lunch or even a beer. It's a great cafe that I hope stays in the neighborhood for years to come."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"The atmosphere was really great; with Latin and American music in the background, the food felt really delicious. The coffee had an excellent balance. The butcher block table made quite an impact on me. Really nice architectural detail!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Amazing food and services every time I️ visit.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Love the vibe! The staff is very cordial and inviting, typical of it's Latin roots. The menu offers many choices and prices are in line with SF's trendy spots. You won't stay hungry after eating your meal. I go there often when in The City.   Seal it with a cup of their delicious coffee."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,They open early walked in at 6:15 am . Excellent service and great coffee.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Needed something fast to eat and that happened. Definitely Latino cooking style with lots of flavor. I had shrimp and crab with arroz (rice) and it was delicious. However, service was slow. Had to ask for my check. Ambiance was cool and would return."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Decent Mission district Mexican/Modern American food. Flavorful but not too salty or greasy. Service was great. Good if you are hungry, as the portions are large."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"TL;DR: there are so many good and cheap Latin places in the mission, don't spend your money here. Don't trust other reviews - place just went through renovation and changed the menu to a standard American menu, and spiked up the prices, some dishes doubling their price."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,One of the best cafe's in the city. I can't start my day without having my White mocha there. The people work there are very nice and friendly. They also serve very good quality sandwiches and salads.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Quality coffee and espresso (strong! 👍) as well as a delicious assortment of freshly baked pastries, and a food menu that is more than reasonably priced. Great food, clean, and a full service bar for anyone looking for something good during happy hour or in general. …"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"The only thing keeping me from a five-star rating is caution more than anything else - perhaps after a few more visits I'll be able to wholeheartedly give Taza my complete support like that.  The drinks were fantastic, decently priced, and the guacamole and ceviche was delicious. Perfect place to spend a Friday night with a friend, drinking, chatting, and snacking."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Delicious Food! Very friendly staff. Highly recommend!
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"The food was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. We started with the oysters which were very fresh. Then, I had the Arroz Con Camarones. It came with a generous portion of shrimp and the plantains were crispy and flavorful. Desert was a chocolate cake with fresh raspberries. I enjoyed everything and would go again."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Generally this place is great -- they have pretty good food (I got a veggie omelet), decent coffee drinks, and free WiFi.  I've come here twice to get some work done while in the Mission. I love that pretty much nobody else uses it as their home office, and that most of the people who come here are Hispanic.  Both times I ate here, though, homeless people came in and harassed people for money. I know it's not the fault of the establishment (or the homeless people, really), but it's not a great experience to have every time you go somewhere. So, I'll probably come back but I'm not sure if I'll stay long."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"great sandwiches and pastry! I like this place because it is authentic and the coffee is not bad at all. Yes, the area is not Versailles but the service is good and you can enjoy a nice croissant with a latte without being ripped off like in other places..."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I'm not the one to give reviews so much but this place deserves one this time. I work less than a block away from this place and go and buy food and coffee almost every day but today I had a bad experience, I called on advance to have my order ready by the time I get there and it so happens the guy who toke my order did it wrong then the guy who prepares the bagels and sandwiches has preferences with females and since there was a hot girl who came in way after me he made her sandwich first. I get it some business have favorite customers but I have been buying coffee and food from them for over a year and I feel disappointed of their bad service and now because those 2 unprofessional employees they will lose me as a customer and my recommendation to customers who visit my store. Over all I won't recommend this place they are not as good as before they take so long to prepare your order and they will probably messed up also if you are not a hot looking girl you will probably not get your food done. To the La Taza management team I'll make sure all my customers  know how bad your service is and I'll recommend other restaurants or Coffee shops before you guys. LUIS."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"This one of my favorite coffee spots in SF. This us truly a Mission establishment. Latino owned with an eclectic Latin cafe menu. Coffee is a good, food is tasty and the service us friendly and fast. There is WiFi, but it is not a pretentious hipster place!"
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Excellent service. Friendly staff. Good coffee and pastries. Very clean coffee shop.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"😡😡La Taza - Worst place I’ve ever been.😡😡 Waitress asked me for how many people, I said 4, but I told her the rest were looking for parking. She still gave me the table anyways. My friends took a bit longer than usual cause anyone that lives here in SF knows parking is a total nightmare. They came 3 times asking how many in my party and if they were coming any time soon. 2 times they came and told me “we told you that we don’t sit people if the whole party is not here” (so not true, they told me after I was sitting down). The last time the waitress came she was very rude and mean and was yelling at me and ask me for the table if everyone wasn’t there and that they don’t sit anyone unless the whole party wasn’t present. I got up and left and my friends were right outside getting out of the car. They told me they wanted to eat there so I swallow my pride and went back inside to wait for another 10mins for another table. I ordered a Tres leches pancakes which did not taste like tres leches at all and had an enormous amount of whip cream of top. IHOP has better pancakes than those. Very pricey we paid $54 for 2 breakfasts and a plate of 2 pancakes. Pleople please don’t go there. They need to respect people and be nice to customers, but instead they treat Latinos with no respect and I’m sure they will not do that to a different race. Latinos discriminating latinos, very sad. Spanish Version: Me pregunto cuantos éramos y dije 4, pero los demás están buscando parqueo. Para los que vivimos en San Francisco en general es muy difícil encontrar parqueo y pues se tardaron un poquito en llegar. Mientras yo esperaba nadie me atendía. Al fin llega alguien y me pregunta otra vez que cuantos éramos y le dije 4, y me dijo le traeré los menús. Le dije que si muchas gracias. Me puse haber si ordenaba una bebida en lo que esperaba, pero en lugar de preguntarme si quería algo vino alguien más y me dijo cuantos éramos y si ya estaban todos ahí, (obvio no pues las sillas estaban vacías duh), y le dije que estaban buscando parqueo y luego me dijo “nosotros no sentamos a nadie si no están todos los del grupo, le daré como 2 minutos para ver si llega el resto pues tenemos gente esperando”. Le dije al señor que desde que entre les dije que los demás estaban buscando parqueo, luego trate de comunicarme con ellos y no pude. Después llega otra mesera y me dice, “le dije que no sentamos a nadie si no están todos y si su grupo no viene necesitamos la mesa” (a estas alturas ya se me caía la cara de vergüenza y me moleste) Me levante y le dije ahí está su mesa, y me salí del lugar a toparme con mis amigos afuera parqueados enfrente. Les comuniqué mi frustración pero ellos querían comer ahí y pues doblegue mi orgullo y entramos de regreso a esperar por una mesa. Al fin nos sentaron y miraba como se murmuraban todos, pues 2 meseros me pidieron la mesa y ellos se encargaron de decirle a todos los demás trabajadores lo que había pasado (como buenos latinos el chisme no puede faltar). Pedí unos pancakes de 3 leches, pero de 3 leches no tenían nada (creo que solo el nombre tienen pues me supieron como cualquier pancakes, y ayer comí un pastel de Whole Foods de 3 leches y estaba delicioso se los recomiendo al 100). Bueno mis amigos pidieron chilaquiles y un desayuno típico. Por todo nos salió casi $54 dólares (aparte del horrible trato son súper careros), encima de eso los baños estaban cerrados, afuera de la cocina estaban jalando con una vacum el agua que se había salido de los toilets pues estaba inundado, pero no querían que pasara al lado de las mesas, y todo el excremento estaba saliendo afuera por las tuberías de la acera y lo estaban regando con una manguera para que el mal olor no quedara ahí). Salí de ahí con un trago muy amargo y pues espero nunca mas regresar. Si usted quiere seguir apoyando esa clase de negocios hágalo, pero por eso estamos como estamos, latinos discriminando latinos. Realmente muy triste."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Breakfast burritos are bomb! They include mushrooms which is not typical but welcomed. I got mine with salsa on the side.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Well two and a half stars.  This place has gotten much publicity, is busy usually, and looks promising.  But the kitchen: flank steak was incredibly tough and stringy, suitable to be fed to a dog you dislike.  Hamburger was OK thanks to abundant accroutrements, but the ground beef was so so at best.  It is not the cleanest place in appearance either."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I had a craving for plantains con crema, so I visited Cafe La Taza this morning. Avocado toast on sour dough accompanied my craving. Both were freshly prepared and delicious."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Quant and not your typical café. Variety breakfast  options. I had the lox bagel with dulce de leche latte. Yum
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Always happy to support and patronize the Mission District businesses and I must commend the staff here for being so diligent about making sure they have the orders right and that the food comes as quickly to the table as possible!

Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I've been here a few times and liked the food, menu options, coffee, service. Last time I took my friend the staff jumped up the volume of country Mexican music to message us they were closing vs letting us know in person, we both thought it was odd."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Came here recently after several years for the first time. It is still a friendly quality place with great food! Most definitely will come back for the best cup of coffee!
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Hmmm, good food, but inconsistent. My food was ready, but it stayed underneath the ""warming"" lights for at least 5 minutes, and my breakfast was cold. Plus, one of the expediters served my coffee ""overhand,"" placing her fingers on the rim of my cup. Uuugh."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Friendly and great food. Happy hour is my favorite - champagne and oysters on the half shell- yum!! The treats and portions are solid. Way to go! L
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Service is good and staff is friendly. Occasionally, it takes a while for the food to arrive, but otherwise solid. Thai chicken salad is great and the cobb salad is huge."

Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Stumbled into here one morning on my way from the latin market down the street, and I honestly had no idea what an operation this was! Upon first glance, thought it was just a coffee shop. Nope, they have baked goods, a full menu - breakfast and lunch (maybe also dinner), along with a full cafe drink menu. Delicious, and super fast, efficient service."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I love  this place so much. I come almost every day and I feel at home. Parking ? Yes a little hard but well worth it Staff??? The best!!! Thank you Leonor., Leah., Giovanni and everyone. !!"

Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Good breakfast, great coffee, just too expensive to be on that Mission, area with dirty streets. Visit just for tbe Chilaquiles. Expended $40.00 + tip, the advised on receipt. ""Just for breakfast, more then in Orlando Florida, and you know is ecpensive in Orlando!!!"

Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Not peaceful environment, hard to have a conversation with loud regueton Food okay."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Cafe La Taza is a great Latin-inspired spot on Mission, across the street from Foreign Cinema. The food is fresh and consistently good, and is fairly inexpensive compared to most of its competition. The coffee and espresso drinks are above average, maybe not on par with Four Barrel or Blue Bottle, but certainly acceptable for all but the most snobbish of caffeine snobs."
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,Great brunch place. Nice pancakes and scrambles.
Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"Good place overall. Don't come here if you plan to use the wifi. It is advertised as free, but doesn't actually connect to the Internet."

Cafe La Taza,2475 Mission St,"I have been a frequent customer for several years. And they are all super nice and accommodating to me. That is enough for me. I'm not very varied in what I order, but from what I've tried I can say: *Sandwiches ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍🏼 *Omelets ⭐⭐⭐⭐ *Coffee and options of bread and/or empanadas ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍🏼👌🏽 *Service in person ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍🏼👌🏽 *Service by phone ⭐⭐ if they are busy they can leave you on the line for a few minutes... My experience on 2 occasions was that they forgot about me 🤷🏽‍♀️ but they rewarded me with delicious bread 👍🏼 * Soups of the day ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *Portions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *Price ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
