Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Friendly barista and staff. Great setting. Plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy the beautiful views.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"It's a Starbucks for goodness sake! Often reliable and consistent.  While they are mostly all the same, this one, in the Presidio, is worth a visit. Grab your beverage of choice and get seated in the splendid, outdoors patio area. Nice, comfortable, clean and beautiful views of wonderfully manicured lawns and gardens. It's about the location!"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Favorite Starbucks locay! Absolutely love the location and views from here. The outdoor seating area is beautiful and the access to this Starbucks is lovely too. Always our go-to coffee fix whenever we're around the Golden Gate. You can see the palace of fine arts from here! And the cafe isn't usually crowded like the other ones.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Two stars for location and ambiance.  But man they don’t change the hand sanitizer showing where Starbucks likes to cut costs!  It’s always empty and now been empty for >2 weeks.  Excuse?  “It’s broken.”  The thing is made of plastic and must cost less than one of their over-priced drip coffees!
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Yes!  Hot coffee and heated chocolate croissant.  Love that this place is open for business at sunup. Pleasant and professional workers.  Great view of Palace of Fine Arts too!  Ann was a wonderful sales lady (barista?) to help serve me these last four days.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"The Starbucks in the Presidio has to be one of the chillest in the city. This is just a lovely place to have a good cup of coffee, work, chat with friends, or enjoy the park like setting. Nice views too. This is my grandson observing a friendly duck and the Palace of Fine Arts in the distance."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"It's in The Presidio.❤ They had me at Presidio. We ordered a peppermint mocha to commemorate and remember my son Shane,a beautiful soul whom lived in and loved SF. We lost him 3 years ago to the day. The barista allowed us to split it in 2 cups so we could toast to him. The entire staff were lovely and helpful. I really like the vibe in here. It's a beautiful location."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"A very not in your face starbucks. Quite hidden. Lots of seating inside and outside patio. First time there was a lot of washrooms actually. 2 stalls on the women's side. Lots of packaged options like legume and egg options, variety of sandwiches as well as all the usual stuff."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,A cute Starbucks location with good beverages. A great spot for studying/getting work done.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,One of the nicest Starbucks around imo. Great place to eat lunch and grab a drink on a beautiful day!
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Truly lovely Presidio grounds for enjoying the best of San Francisco views and walking paths. Great place for kids. Nice service. Starbucks at Letterman campus.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"This location is along my daily walk and I love the outdoor patio, however the some of the staff tend not to be very warm. Majority of the time they do not greet you, or even acknowledge you when you’re standing in front of them to pick up your order - if you ask for a sleeve, it’s like you’re asking for the world. They will literally hand it to you with zero expression on their face. I totally get that this location struggles to keep employees - maybe this is a sign for better management, but either way, it cost $.00 to be warm and smile. Will consider using the location on Chestnut instead."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,It was like a treasure hunt to find this location but never the less it’s worth the effort. This is located in the beautiful vicinity and loved the environment around it.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Extremely clean shop and friendly crew!  Even the bathrooms are nice!  Great place to sit outside and enjoy the park view of the Palace of Fine Arts building.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"A number of folks taking up room/tables, not drinking or eating any of Starbucks' beverages or food items. New customers coming in were forced to take their purchases outside when it was raining and blowing. Rude customers, sure, but no apparent rules about ""squatting."""
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Same Starbucks food and drinks. Friendly staff. One of them saw that I had my dog with me and offered a puppuccino. Lovely place where it is located
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Friendly staff & Starbucks coffee. The view and the ambience are just stunning. One of the best Starbucks in the world!
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"20 mn for a single iced tea and a guy just stole it in front of me and drunk it in half a second to be sure…! Ok, never again."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Great location for a Starbucks! Grabbed a coffee here while visiting the Palace of Fine Arts, Lyon Street Steps, and the Yoda Fountain. Surrounded by such a beautiful park and the service was quick and friendly."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Great location and quiet atmosphere, 5 minutes from Palace of Fine Art"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,The coffee was good/typical Starbucks. The restaurant was not as clean/tidy as I would have liked
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Very good location close to Palace of Fine Arts. Very crowded in the weekend though.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"WORST Starbucks in San Francisco. They have no food in shelves always empty,  place an order after waiting for over 5 minutes they tell you they don’t have it. Manager Ryan is very loud and likes to argue with customers. Staff carry loud conversations of what they did over the weekend and not pay attention to customers."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,1:00pm on a Friday. No wait. Ruben was friendly. Excellent cold brew coffee. BEAUTIFUL VIEW!
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Right on the campus so you will see people come out of the office and working. Staff were friendly. Nice amount of seating inside and out.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"EDIT:  this was apparently more of an issue of bad signage (or a sudden change of mind, but likely bad signage).  The note said ""new hours . . .   closing at 1"" when it probably should have said ""closing early today.""  . . . I am sitting here outside Starbucks on the Presidio at 1:30 PM on a Friday afternoon, watching literally dozens of people approach the front door, read the sign saying they have new hours and no close at 1 pm, and walk away dejectedly."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Very good Starbucks branch at a very convenient location at Presidio, the prices can be a little bit high compared to other Starbucks I've been and it was kind of slow compared to other Starbucks branches but it was good overall"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"One of the best Starbucks in the City. Spacious, great staff, well stocked with goodies and the views of the Presidio...  stunning!"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"I as an asian female was standing right in front of the counter but the guy asked the other 2 white male first, who came after me, what they would order. I felt offended.  Gave 2 star instead of 1 simply because I used to like this location. From now on I would choose other locations."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Great food and coffee, friendly staff. Very clean and pleasant place apart from the constantly squeaking door !!!! It would only take a few squirts of oil to fix this, it's extremely irritating"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,The Starbucks in the San Francisco Presidio may be the most beautiful location of all.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Excellent location, beautiful views, nice place to relax and grab a coffee. Needs more staff & seating/space for the amount of customers here."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Great coffee shop located in a park. Just missing a few comfortable lounge seating.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Service was good and view was awesome!
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"The location is pretty much perfect with nice views in a pretty park. Interior is pretty clean and standard for a Starbucks. The staff however is not very friendly. Been here a few times and have never seen any of them smile. Not a demanding customer, I always just drink americano, but definitely don't feel very welcome."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,It's a hidden Starbucks behind the building.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"This is not your average Starbucks. I love it b/c of the peaceful surroundings of the Presidio with serene immaculately landscaped rolling hills, a nice lake with fountain, beautifully manicured trees and ducks peacefully floating around in the pond. It's a bit out of the way but worth the trek if you want a strong cup of coffee coupled with some beautiful scenery."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,This Starbucks has too be the best location  for a coffee break in San Francisco..a great place to grab a cup coffee hang out relax outdoors..a fantastic view of the bay..just tell the security guard by the entrance that your getting coffee you can park for free for 30 minutes...just enough for one's coffee to cool .No picture you have to go for your self  to explore
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Come here nearly every day. Lines can be long, so be sure to just order on the app. Workers are friendly and the shop is clean. This is inside Lucas films campus so there's plenty of walking areas to enjoy the scenery."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Born with good looks and in the fanciest of neighborhoods, this Starbucks is born privileged. A.k.a. doesn’t try too hard, my matcha latte, felt lighter than usual. My almond biscotti stale- old money, old almonds."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Can’t get no better. Best place for a drink in the Presidio with fantastic views of the Palace of Fine Arts
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Normally this is one of my favorite Starbucks locations but today the service was a bit off.  The gentleman preparing the food i ordered forgot an item i ordered and then tried to excuse it by saying it took longer when i ordered three orders of egg bites. I had to ask for forks because he  didnt include them.   This is a busy location and its always a long line which is usually balanced by warm and efficent service.  Maybe it was just a bad morning.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Theres charging outlets and table and chairs! Next to Yoda is a plus of cos
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Very busy location in the morning! However service is fast and friendly. Great location to sit outside or walk around. Enjoy views of the Golden Gate Bridge and a cute little park with ducks and a fountain.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Beautiful location, really! I've never been to a more perfect spot. Lots of outdoor seating with trees and flowers. BUT, the management here is horrible. Every time I come in there's a line out the door and only 1 cashier. The workers don't seem to work well together or as a team. It's like 6 individuals are doing their own thing, which impacts the service. For instance...today, there were 10 people in line, 1 cashier, 1 barista and 4 people restocking?!?!? I also swear one of the women working glared at me when I went to get half and half while she was cleaning the counter. Like full on glare... I actually started laughing because, geeze, that's a new experience.  Honestly, I suggest some team building, communication and better management. Efficiency, lol. This Could be a fantastic Starbucks, but severely falls short. I'm adding this to Yelp too, maybe they can make some adjustments?"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,A Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks.... Nothing special took longer than average... Made my chai latte incorrectly first then mafe three other drinks before making me the correct order. The park out front with the small pond is nice.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Probably the best kept secret of this city - the Starbucks in the Presidio!  Not gonna tell where it is, but it makes for a perfect stop on your Sunday stroll, surrounded by trees and meadows. It even has an outdoor area for the sunny days (yes, sunny days), and, for your convenience, a restroom that is not locked by a code.  The staff during my visit was very fast, but not really friendly. Oh well, I can forget about that and just enjoy my Grande Pike out there in the sun."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Hidden among a beautifully landscaped national park! Relax on the patio, grab some java prior to the Yoda fountain visit, or just realize how awesome it is to have access to one of the prettiest locations for a Starbucks in the entire United States. Across from Presidio Social Club, get a temporary parking permit from the red coat security at Letterman/Lucas Plaza and enjoy the view of the Palace of Fine Arts!"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Lovely little starbucks on the LucasFilms grounds that overlooks the Palace of Fine Arts.  There can often be a wait, but it’s worth the view"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Lots of mobile orders come thru here, so when there is a rush, it can take a little longer."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,They only fill single use plastic cups. I took my personal cup and they refused service in it. Do not recommend going here. Starbucks is promoting reusable cups but they don’t want to fill them
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"The service was standard, nothing out of the ordinary. Asked for room in our tea and our cup was filled to the top. Once my partner and I got settled in our seats I went to the bathroom to relieve myself and wash up. The bathroom stall, the only one available because the other had an out of order sign, unusable. Pee I presume was splashed all over the seat. Fecal particulate was visible around the toilet bowl close the the seat. I walked out and notified the barista on bar. The message got relayed and the girl who went in to clean it up only wiped down the seat. Frankly I'm embarrassed, as I'm an ex-starbucks team member and was QASA lead. I used the bathroom that time as I couldn't beat any longer. I let them know it was still pretty gross. I used the facilities once more before I left and same condition. If an audit would have happened I wonder what else would have failed besides the bathroom cleanliness?"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,I don’t leave reviews but this has been by far the worst Starbucks experience I’ve ever had in the world. Arrogant person taking my order. Who ultimately got my order wrong after a few attempts at ordering 2 simple nitro cold brews.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Very cozy place in beautiful area. It was ckean with awesome emoloyees. The service was quick and it wasn't packed with people, so no lines. You have inside and outsude dining areas, and the coffee is flawless. One of the best branches in San Francisco."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"The atmosphere is great. Clean, Quick Service yet calm environment, cool crowd. However, my white chocolate was Allman and whip tasted like bacon😲 …"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Stopped in for a cold drink and to use the wifi before going to Golden Gate Bridge. Staff were so strange, the cashier was friendly but didnt seem to understand what i said, and the barista was literally screaming peoples names for their drink. Not in a loud friendly way (like other starbucks) but actually yelling. The bathrooms were all out of soap and TP and were absolutely disgusting."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,This is the most pleasant Starbuck's we've ever been to! Beautiful setting. Lots of seating with great views. Friendly staff.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"This is a nice quiet relaxing place to get work done or just hang out with friends. The service is great and the coffee is standard, as with any other Starbucks. I would recommend coming here."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Very loud and expensive Impossible to sit more than 10 minutes without getting frustrated with all the noise
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,One of my favorite Starbucks in the entire US. Views are super amazing. Although it can be very loud on weekends but overall it's really nice. I love the dark roast sumatra at Starbucks.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,It's beautiful location. But one of the worst Starbucks in Sanfrancisco USA. The employees in this Starbucks and their service's are bullshit and sucks. And taste wise also its worst. Don't prefer this Starbucks.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"Better than most Starbucks I have been to.  Not nearly as crowded, they offered a good recommendation for tea, and the location outside the building is beautiful."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,I hope you got the chance to taste a Darth Mocha ! It is delicious!!
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"This location is rarely crowded and has fast WiFi. Nice location out of the way of the hustle and bustle of other Starbucks. Often dirty, messy, and sticky though."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Why are they closing at 1 now?  Ridiculous. Kick them out and put in a PEETS if they can’t serve the community better than this.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"A Starbucks that's somewhat hard to find, but it happens to be one of the more beautiful location for the coffee chain.  Food and service same as everywhere else, but the scenery is awesome."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"The girl that got my order was extremely rude. Could not answer my questions, did not got my order nor my name. It’s a nice spot you guys should get nicer people."
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,Decent Starbucks. But take your coffee or snack outside and drink it on a bench in the park overlooking the pond and the Palace of Fine Arts in the distance.
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"They have good WiFi connection, charging spots,clean bathrooms, nice outdoor sitting"
Starbucks,1 Letterman Dr Building C,"I was here on a Sunday, around 1-2pm. long line, very loud music and conversations. could not do work here. if you want to try, be sure to bring headphones or ear plugs. also, furniture is rather old and crumbs everywhere."
