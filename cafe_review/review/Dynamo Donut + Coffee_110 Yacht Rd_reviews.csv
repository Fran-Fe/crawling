Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Delicious coffee and donuts. Great location. Outdoor seating on the water. Very unique flavors of donuts available. Wonderful staff.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"What a great location in between presidio green and crissy field. The flavors draw you in but I don't know if it's the time I always grab a donut but it just doesn't hit like Stan's or Bob's.  Passion fruit milk chocolate was tasty but the donut itself was a bit lacking.  Still, service is kind and prices are not ridiculous. Nice little pitstop for something sweet. No complaints but it's not going to take your breath away."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Fun little donut shack with diverse selection of interesting flavors. Tried the cornmeal rosemary pcherry and it wasn't that corny.  Extremely delicious.  Could eat one a day. The gal working there was attentive and helpful.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Dynamo Donuts in Marina San Francisco offers a delightful variety of fresh, unique flavors. Coffee, cappuccino, friendly staff, and innovative twists on classic donuts make it a must-visit spot for any donut enthusiast."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,One of my favorite spots in SF. Incredibly tasty and adventurously-flavored donuts with vegan varieties. Great coffee. A picturesque and sereen spot in the Marina. Free parking. Heaven.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Great spot to warm up with a coffee, espresso, or tea, and of course grab an outstanding doughnut!  Go for the maple and applewood bacon one!  Service was also very nice and helpful."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Ohhhhh my..... Perfect pit stop after your run. The donut is gorgeous. Ultra fresh, ""light"" and amazing flavors. My cappuccino was perfect too (and I'm picky)"
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Really good coffee and donuts. I think it's reasonably priced coming from Phoenix. There's a nice view of the beach too and close to the Palace of Fine Arts
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Great doughnuts and such a cute little place! 😊There’s some tables right outside for a seating area, and they have doggie doughnuts for pups! …"
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"They have different specialty donuts each day and they are scrumptious! We had a vanilla chocolate and a maple bacon one, not too sweet, just right. Tiny tiny coffees, $3. I know that sounds cheap but I’m not from California and it was the size of my thumb. But, with that said, everything is priced in accordance with the cost of living there and it was not a huge shock. The coffee was delightful, regardless. Quick service! Right near the water so it’s nice if you want to grab a bite before continuing to explore Or once you’re done too!"
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,The yacht club location isn't open. That's where maps takes you and it says it is open. Called. And it's their other location. Need to update your maps.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,12-20-20: Open during the shelter in place! Ordered a Bacon maple donut and a vanilla bean donut! Both were excellent. Drank a cup of coffee too with my breakfast. Everything was delicious and would definitely come back again for more treats!
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,This place is fantastic and has an amazing gluten free option.  Coffee is also excellent and the people are a friendly bunch.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,PRO: Good Gluten Free donuts CON: No telephone at this location
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Nice spot for grabbing a coffee and espresso when walking the marina. Espresso was excellent, bonus points for having ‘real’ cups and not only paper ones!"
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,My favorite doughnuts in the world! Their gluten-free/vegan doughnuts are truly incredible.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"If you like cakey donuts with unusual flavors, this is for you. If you like the classic style donuts (winchell’s / Bobs), this is not for you.  Otherwise a great spot to sit outside or stop by while walking the dog.  The espresso coffee drinks are good too."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Ferociously delicious!  Beautiful area on the marina walk way.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Service is always good no complaint with this business so fare
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,The donuts are so good that they frequently sell out. It's a little hut in the park supplied by the main shop in the mission so their hours and availability can be a bit variable.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,What is there to say? Dynamo makes the best donuts anywhere. Hands-down.  Full stop.
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Great little place to get coffee, right down on the waterfront. Fast friendly service. Coffee is small, and relatively expensive. But given the location, that is to be expected. Also, there is a public bathroom directly across the field. so if you're out for a hike, especially during the covid-19 apocalypse, this is a place where you can grab a snack, use the restroom, and see the beautiful waterfront."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"I've had some Dynamo donuts before and they're alright. Last time I went here was post-run with a group of women who split a donut and all seemed to really like it. I think it might be cash only? The nice part of this location is it's right on the water, so it's very pleasant to grab some coffee or coffee and donut and sit outside."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Good donuts and coffee with great views
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Good strong coffee and donuts lived up to the hype! Beautiful views too 😻 …
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Picked up some delicious donuts here and watched the fog reveal the Golden Gate Bridge. Fun place!
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"Perfect location if you're touring around the Embarcadero in San Francisco. It's right before Crissy Field, the restored wetlands that leads up to Ft. Point and the Golden Gate Bridge. If you're on a bicycle or walking, great place for a quick stop. You can eat right there, or head over to the water, about 200 yards away, with benches and plenty of places to take your doughnuts with you. Great place for people-watching as walkers and runners all pass right by. Dynamo specializes in weird flavors, though, which may or may not be what you want. A little pricey, too. And the hours are limited, so check on that ahead of time. But it's a cool little place and a neat way to get off your feet for a bit."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,"The guy working is a great barista, and super honest. The square card reader he was using double charged me, something I didn't find out till the next day, where I also found a credit back. Super honest, great latte, all around nice place.  Will be back the next time I'm in town."
Dynamo Donut + Coffee,110 Yacht Rd,Good place to check out the doughnut stall for interesting doughnut flavours. I am a fan of the ginger orange. The maple bacon apple was okay. I couldn't taste the apple in it.
