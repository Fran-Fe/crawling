Starbucks,100 1st St,Always good drinks and nice staff. Quick service and consistent quality and eager to fix anything that isn’t the best.
Starbucks,100 1st St,Best Starbucks location in SF! Right on top of Salesforce Transit Terminal on 5th floor with beautiful views!
Starbucks,100 1st St,Joslin was super sweet.  I wanted low calorie drink & she was happy go over different options for me. I ended up ordering skinny vanilla latte. I do wish that it was hotter.
Starbucks,100 1st St,"The drink was nice, just like other Starbucks.   But the manager was rude, unlike other Starbucks."
Starbucks,100 1st St,The world’s first (and currently only) co-branded Starbucks!
Starbucks,100 1st St,Best Starbucks in all of San Francisco very personal home feeling here come on a regular and be expected to be greeted by name with a smile thank you Starbucks team for making my days awesome
Starbucks,100 1st St,Located rifht next to the Transit Center and therefore always busy.
Starbucks,100 1st St,This Starbucks is really nice and cute!
Starbucks,100 1st St,Safety precautions friendly staff relaxed vibes thank you!
Starbucks,100 1st St,Not the first time I go in and get told  “ this is what you ordered and don’t even get offered a remake of the drink” If i was at fault and given the wrong order I would of been fine but when I showed them the drink I wanted I still got told I was in the wrong....  Unfortunately didn’t get this woman’s name and would not like to use ethnicity to describe her.  It’s ridiculous to have this type of service in a place that chargers a minimum of 5 dollar for any beverage you get. Like I said this is not the first time this happens and management seemed to agree with her when I asked for a remake of the drink.
Starbucks,100 1st St,Another nice Starbucks!
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Starbucks is a known quality and this one did not disappoint.  I got what I ordered - exactly what I ordered.  What was supposed to be cold,  was,  and what was supposed to be warm , was.   What more can you ask?  The Starbucks mobile app makes ordering exactly what you want easy and quick - I highly recommend it!"
Starbucks,100 1st St,A good place and very welcoming staffs.
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Starbucks how can you go wrong? Your selection is good and coffee is sort of strong Your efficient at making the brew of life Helps me stay awake so at work there's no strife Your almost on every block it's crazy Good thing for me because I'm lazy  Typical Starbucks. They make everything the same, you know what you're getting, not bad :)"
Starbucks,100 1st St,"My go-to Starbucks before heading to work. I often order online here and my order is always ready to go by the time arrive, or gets fulfilled very quickly. One time, my order was forgotten, but I told a barista and they fixed it for me right away."
Starbucks,100 1st St,This shop doesn't have the same amenities that I've been spoiled by at other Starbucks (wireless chargers and outlets). It's also not very large so it can become crowded. The lines are also fairly brutal.
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Awful place. Like all other Starbucks places in San Francisco. First they banned giving stopper for the coffee. Now while you carring your cup till the destination you constantly spilling on yourself. Second they went even further. They are not giving lids on the register and they suggested to carry my super hot large coffee without a lid and a sleeve to sugar station . You know, if spill steaming coffee while doing this it will be perfect lawsuit."
Starbucks,100 1st St,Always a great experience for grandma and the kids. grandma enjoys a half-caff double tall 1 pump vanilla non-fat extra hot caramel macchiato. Where as I prefer a double espresso macchiato with extra foam. The kids get nothing if they cry. Frapps if they obey me.
Starbucks,100 1st St,This Starbucks kicks butt! The place is swarmed each work day morning and they just crank out the drinks. It is always a pleasure to see them working so efficiently and friendly.
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Used to go to this location often on my way to work, I've reconsidered that now.  I ordered a nitro brew via mobile order, arrived to find out they were out and was handed a cup of 4 espresso shots at room temperature with milk barely in it.  When I asked for a refund, I was told it was not possible due to ""corporate limiting how mobily ordering happens"".  Time to become a die hard local coffee addict."
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Usual Starbucks service, quick and easy and the location was clean and inviting."
Starbucks,100 1st St,Nice starbucks with views of salesforce park.
Starbucks,100 1st St,The service here is AMAZING! Nice place to sit outside and people watch.
Starbucks,100 1st St,I ordered a soy latte and it mysteriously had sugar even though I didn’t ask for it. Now i have to throw it in the trash.
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Acceptable coffee, but can't get a simple unheated muffin order right. Trouble 2 out of 3 visits."
Starbucks,100 1st St,"Now I am no connoisseur of Coffee nor will I ever boast of being one, however I can tell you this Starbucks really makes the Star come to mind. being elevated I would guess 4 or 5 levels above the ground nestled into the side of the Salesforce Tower completely shocked me when I first laid eyes on it the first time. this Beautiful Creation that is the salesforce park a feat of modern ingenuity and know how complimented with a brilliant idea of attaching the park to the building and letting absolutely anyone share a cup of coffee in the tallest building in San Francisco. You may not be on the top floor or the viewing deck but either way is definitely a neat experience. I would recommend to anyone looking for something to occupy your afternoon or want to take a walk somewhere with a friend or even alone make your destination Starbucks at the Salesforce Park you will not be let down. The Baristas were very knowledgeable and willing to create just about any concoction you could imagine. Starbucks really pulled out the nice dinner plates for this location the interior is very warm and welcoming in a moderately windy area so can come as a well needed break even though the park itself has areas to which you can sit and get out of the wind but none have the ingenious romance of Visibly pleasing qualities paired with that of the aromatic essence from the freshly ground coffee beans. All in all this Starbucks is my favorite Starbucks I have ever visited Just the marriage of the park and Starbucks was a wonderful idea that everyone who walks up is able to enjoy. 10/10 for me it may not be a landmark or historical place of San Francisco but if you are a tourist put this on your list of to do's since it will also take you to an astonishing park on top of a bus terminal 4 or 5 stories above street level with views that will take you breath away but at least the park has all the foliage, plants and trees to when you do catch you breath at least it will be a fresh one. Thank you for taking the time to read my Review I am Jonathan Ellmann and I will post a new review tomorrow. I will do so every day and I will begin recording my times in these locations and post it on YouTube to show all the wonderful things San Francisco has to offer so come take a trip with me all over San Francisco, The Bay Area and who knows where this might take me!"
