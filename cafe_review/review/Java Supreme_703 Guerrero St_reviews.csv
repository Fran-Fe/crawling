Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,The turkey sandwich with pesto and avocado was awesome.  Good price and quick service.  Don't forget to check the secret menu.
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,"Food and drinks are great. Super value for money. The place is simple, not many unnecessary sophistications. Sometimes the owner may not seem 100% empathetic but the service is still good."
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,I ordered an iced latte and I can honestly say it was one of the worst coffee drinks I’ve ever had in my life. My boyfriend and I both agreed it was “undrinkable.” I don’t even think he made it with espresso (I think he used old ice coffee?). Threw it away after one sip. I gave them two stars because the person was nice at least.
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,cute little cafe in the neighborhood. very nice owners - they even give treats when there are dogs visiting. my favorite is the java supreme (coffee + chocolate syrup + syrup of your choice) and Matt’s plate (they told me it’s inspired by one of the customers). The regular customers would bring their own containers for food and drinks. Healthy and environmentally friendly.
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,"was told i couldn't dine in only after I got my food and sat down to eat, while there were many empty tables and two other customers were dining in"
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,"Went there to work in a coffee shop for an hour. After buying a drink and food, they told us that they don’t let people dine in or work. Would’ve been nice if they told us before buying food. Don’t come here to work or sit down, the seats and outlets are for visual aesthetic only."
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,"Great coffee - only place around serving strong coffee at less than $2/large. Best juice-free green smoothie around. Sandwiches are delicious and substantial for not expensive. Bagel sandwiches are yummy too. Nice, friendly hosts. Opens early, perfect when you need coffee at 7am."
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,"Very rude service. And on top of that, the coffee tasted like water. Do not come here."
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,"They accept all kinds of payments now. The two folks behind the counter every day are really sweet. Great bagel sandwiches. Solid cheap coffee. Mostly locals, like myself, who are regulars. I live a block away and have probably been here about 100 times."
Java Supreme,703 Guerrero St,The couple running the cafe were very nice. Egg and cheese bagel was filling and tasty. If I lived nearby I could easily see myself becoming a regular. Usually enough space to sit and work as well.
