Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,Nice and cozy spot. Good coffee( light roast). Tasty breakfast sandwiches. Friendly owner.
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"My husband and I went to this coffee shop while we were visiting from Phoenix. The coffee was incredible! I had the black & white. The food was good, too. Although it did seem cluttered inside, it was a beautiful day to sit outside so we didn't mind. The owner is extremely service-oriented and friendly. He gave us recommendations of what to do while visiting, and you can tell he is a genuinely nice guy. Definitely one of my top favorite experiences while in town!"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"The best coffee / sandwich I've had in San Fran, and so affordable! The guy working behind the bar in so nice and remembered me from coming in the day before. Very cute window couch seats, internet access. Great espresso. 10/10"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Definitely my favorite cafe in the city! The owner is always super nice, and he makes the best coffee too. They also have a great selection of tea, overall a really under appreciated spot!"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"I never do this but I have no Choice. This place is vile. Went here a few months ago and there was only one person working in the very small space behind the counter. At one point, it may have been a normal cafe with tables, chairs and a place where you could study, ready, or hang out with friends for awhile. But, when I went, it was nearly filled to the brim with stuff — seemingly personal belongings, as though Someone might live there during closed hour. I can’t say enough about health code violations I saw😵‍💫a rat while waiting for my extremely overpriced, gnarly, arguably rotten Arnold palmer. The lemonade was fizzing (a sign of oxidation —  completely rotten , with. Burnt, and ice tea. Everything was dirty. Wouldn’t go back if I was paid to."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,This place is soooo cute and the food is so delicious I love it so much
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,Chester was so sweet and accommodating. Delicious food and yummy coffee and tea. Definitely recommend when visiting.
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Best cafe ever! Super kind staff and customers, really wholesome and delicious 🤤"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"This place reminds me of what I expect out of San Francisco. This is more than just a place with really good coffee. It's place you come to enjoy a cozy local environment and build a connection with the owner. Just like the old days. Very nice vibe and a very unique place with well priced coffee, away from snobbery and overly modernized distractions polluting this city. Please let places like this strive, hangout out here with your friends and family, and enjoy coffee, company, and culture."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,Inside was a wreck. The coffee was 'fresh' but it was burnt. I should have walked out as soon as I smelled the inside. It was not the smell of a good coffee shop. The coffee turned out to be so bad that I went down the street to Cup A Joe and bought a new cup
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"I get coffee here at least once a week, Chester is always great to chat with and the coffee is wonderful."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,One of the best coffee shops in San Francisco. Chester is such a pleasure! 10/10 recommend this place
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,I love this place. I’ve been coming here for 10 years every time I visit SF and it’s been great every since.  Still the same owner and he remembers my children and I every time.  He’s great. The food is great and it has a wonderful corner table with a huge window that just gives you a nice city feel. I can’t wait to be back!
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Desperate for a morning cup of coffee, searched my Google maps and found this gem a half block away. Entering, it seemed a little stressed, but then felt warm & cozy. I actually wanted to stay for a while, but wifey had other plans for breakfast 😕. Coffee was great, sandwich options were nice, but I wasn't hungry (just needed coffee). Owner was very accommodating and conversated while providing great service. Nice place to sit, mingle and enjoy coffee. I miss atmospheric shops like this in Chicago."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"So good! We got a bagel sandwich, coffee, and tea and it was all so good. The owner was so nice as well. Definitely recommend the egg and cheese and on bagel."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Had breakfast at this small, neighborhood cafe while visiting SF. The food was really good quality and Chester (the man in charge) was very nice. I was sorry to hear that the Dutch Pancakes on the menu are no longer being made but if nobody is buying, there is no reason to waste resources and make the batter. If you are staying in the neighborhood, consider Cafe Bean for breakfast one day."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Very not recommend.  I use my card and I paid 23.75 after one day shows on my account they add 5$ extra with not even asking for my permission What is that ...  Be carefully people to pay card there  Yes, please return it. I did not accept any other extra payment  I still did not get refund !!!!"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"I've eaten here over 50 times in 2 years. This is the only place in the area I'll go for breakfast. Chester is so welcoming and the atmosphere is very eclectic. If you want to eat breakfast downtown like a local, this is the place!"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,Great little coffee place. Quiet and affordable. They have Nutella bagels!
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"A cute neighborhood coffee shop that serves coffee, tea, and beer from tap.  The owner is friendly guy chatting with you as he makes your order.  They serve selection of breakfast sandwiches.  There isn't much seating here, on nice day, take draft outside."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"The owner of the place is so cool. He's got all the action figures from Star wars and Marvel characters. The bagels are so good I recommend the CAB Bagel guys!!! It's got avocado, bacon and cream cheese."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"The cafe is a bit of a mess, but don't let that turn you away. The food and coffee were both good.  Friendly service."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"I always get a mocha when I try a new place. Cafe Bean is definitely above average! Service is a bit slow if you're in a hurry, but it's definitely worth the wait. I paid $3. They accept debit/credit cards through Square.  #throughglass"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"This place is a golden spot in San Francisco been going for about 8 years and it has never dissapointed great food and the owner is a great guy who you can always chill and talk about life, great cafe 10000000/100000000"
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Should have walked out the minute I walked in. The place was a mess and did not look professional at all. Ordered two iced coffees, coffee tasted old and burnt - I am by no means a coffee snot but it was so bad my boyfriend and I threw it away."

Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"There was no sense of cleanliness in the store, and life-sized human mannequins were sitting on the seats, and I was startled when I entered. The coffee is normal and I will not visit again."
Cafe Bean,800 Sutter St,"Relaxing / quiet place to work or to have a small (big) coffee in the morning before a big day of visiting SF. Warm and very kind staff, more than adequate price for the quantity, I highly recommend 😄"
