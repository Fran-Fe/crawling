Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Good place for a morning cup of coffee. I ordered a latte which was nice and creamy.  Love the iconic blue bottle logo. Space is beautiful with plentiful seating. Also there is good merch selection at this location (I got a reusable silicon eco cup which I’m very excited to use)
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Decent coffee but inconsiderate staff.  Deliver wrong food. Barista seemed to be suffering from a skin condition while working without gloves.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Super friendly staff, delicious matcha latte with heart shaped almond milk. Yummy banana bread. I guess the only downside is, it’s not very cozy. But it’s fine for just grabbing a drink and sitting down."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Beautiful coffee. Blue Bottle never misses in its quality and preparation. Venue is stark and white and suffers horribly from lack of sound insulation. Moderately busy, it's painfully loud."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Great place to grab a coffee if staying in the Union Square area of San Francisco! The cafe mocha hit the spot!
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"solid blue bottle with ample seating. It gets very loud, so it probably not the best place to take calls or study. The iced New Orleans with oatmilk is great, as always!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Fantastic bright location - awesome coffee every time.  When traveling to the US, after lots of trial-and-error, I have honed in on Blue Bottle Coffee. And their coffee never disappoints.  Ordered their flat-white with whole milk - and got a flawless drink with two ristretto shots mixed in with perfectly microfoamed milk.  Great place to start your day right."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Good place to get a fresh cup of coffee or tea!  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Lots of open space to sit and enjoy your beverages.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,The very first time i got these horrible coffee from blue bottle with rolling eyes staff🙄
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Finally got to try this coffee place. Cute place with very friendly staff. I tried the cappuccino which was really good! Wait time was not that long. They also have coffee beans to purchase.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Came to check this spot and can only say that the place looked clean and the staff was friendly.  I tasted their drip coffee and a latte and both were great tasting, no burnt taste, but well balanced flavors. Not cheap but no pricey for a good cup of coffee."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Coffee is good but they only use paper cups even for eat-in orders. There are ceramic cups on the espresso machine but we were told that they cannot use them due to being short-staffed.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,I tried for the first time almond butter and it was incredibly delicious. I also ordered a matcha latte which it was delightful as well. The employees are so nice. Seems to be a very brand new place but it is highly recommendable.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"visiting SF for work. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Of course, the coffee was exceptional. It was my second visit today and one of the staff actually remembered my name. She just made my day :-) 고맙습니다!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"I like Blue Bottle, but this location seems to be somehow the slowest one I've ever been to. Waiting for 20+ minutes for your coffee is not unusual... And it's not like it's the best coffee you can get.  Seriously I saw them lose multiple orders in one morning. Utterly baffling, save yourself some time"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Brand new blue bottle in between Kearney and Sutter. There are a lot more seatings at this bottle vs the Sansome location. This makes it so much easier to meet with people here without playing musical chairs to find a seat. You can order drinks here through their app as well instead of waiting in line. Great and fast service!!
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Another blue bottle at the heart of SF downtown. Brand new, just opened this week, with friendly and experienced staff. And they are all environmentally conscious, so you can drink great coffee and feel good."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Super friendly staff rung me up and gave my drink a cool foam flourish. I watched from across the cafe as the barista prepared my egregiously basic avocado toast more meticulously than needed, but definitely appreciated. The hearty bread with avacado with a savory spice sprinkle combined with a silky oatmilk latte were a winning combo. I'll be back"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"I've received bad service from different locations. It's usually staff not calling out my drink or an unreasonable wait. If you go here, order online and flag down someone. No promises it'll be ready or correct."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"I specifically asked for a  lungo espresso. I even explained to the cashier What does that mean. He told me we will give it to you. When I went to pick up my drink, it was a plain ristretto shot as I was trying to explain to the barista what I wanted it. She immediately shut me down and she said we don’t do that here!!! Since you don’t do that then why did you take my money from the first place? I have never seen a coffee shop that doesn’t want to cater to the customers. At the end of the day we bring money to you you gotta listen to us.!!!!!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Stylish and minimalistic place. Clean and comfortable. Great coffee and tasty avocado toast! :)
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"So happy Blue Bottle opened up on the corner by my work! I've loved this company since I found them in Austin, TX. Great customer service and coffee. Ray's got a great team there who cares! Super clean store as well."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Excellent service, friendly and helpful atmosphere. Excellent coffee as usual. Try the Brazilian style coffee floater(scoop of icecream in cold coffee, yum)."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Good coffee, nice scones, excellent service!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Amazing first time experience at Blue Bottle! They were so nice! Made great recommendations and comped me my first order!
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Love it 😍 The customer was great 👍 And the sweet late coffee delicious 😱
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Super friendly staff!!! Love the drinks ;)
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Really good staff, clean restroom and yummy drinks and snacks. Perfect place to catch up with friends or to read a book alone."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Lemon almod cake was excellent but it was challenging to transport my latte to the table without spilling - cup was 99.9% full. Hot chocolate was yummy but could be warmer. The cashier could improve on the customer service.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"Can't go wrong with a latte  cappuccino, drip, or americano on the fly or sit down for coffee and convo. Tasty treats available too."
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Ordered an oat milk latte and it was made terribly. The barista was a lady with colored hair she was rude and rushing all the orders. She steamed the milk and poured it straight into the cup in one pour. There was no latte art and lots of bubbles! It tasted weak and off! Difference is night and day from the other blue bottles I’ve been.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Really yummy coffee but expect to pay at least $7 for any drink! 🤣 …
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,A good find in the city. One of the better coffee here.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,This is a good coffee place. The coffee is tasty and comforting. Good place to hang out when you are trying to pass some time and enjoy a nice drink.
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Amazing coffee. Loved the chicory infused Nola styled latte !!
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Coffee is great but wifi not so much. 5mbps…
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,"I went to the Sutter location to buy a gift card for a co-worker. The barista instead talked me into trying a mixed box--3 full size bags of coffee. I was worried that I was gathering a line behind me (I was asking a lot of questions)and he said ""Every customer that comes through these doors is important. Let's answer your questions, so you are a 100% satisfied"".  Honestly, the customer service I receive in this location is pretty fantastic. Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic--I deal with the same young man, I think, and I have to say--whoever hired him knows good people and good people skills!"
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Talk about quality. Huge fan of Blue Bottle Coffee and really appreciate the consistent product. Thanks!  Anthonyxibarrax
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Staff extremely slow today and I was getting frustrated but they were so nice about it and apologized for the wait that I couldn’t stay angry anymore even though it took about 15 mins to get a cuppa mocha. Next time will plan to take out at least 30 mins to grab coffee during the morning rush hour
Blue Bottle Coffee,199 Sutter St,Nice and clean.  Coffee is good as usual.
