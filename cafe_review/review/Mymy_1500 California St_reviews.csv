Mymy,1500 California St,"Great breakfast and lunch spot.  Indoor and outdoor seating.   So many good things on the menu, I tried 2 meals and took the leftovers home. - The Monte Cristo is delicious and properly fried. - I also tried the zucchini Parmesan pancake. This was amazing and I wish I had asked for extra butter."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Came in for breakfast. Short wait to get a table but we got there pretty early. Wife had the french toast and it was amazing. Fresh berries, marscapone cream. I had the bacon and eggs with crispy potatoes and zucchini ricotta pancakes. The bacon was thick and perfectly cooked. The potatoes were crispy. The pancakes were absolutely amazing. If/when im in the area again i will definitely be stopping in for breakfast!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"First time here for breakfast and it was GREAT! Fast, prompt, and polite service! Good was great too! I ordered the Chile verde chilaquiles. Not spicy but very full of flavor. It came with cilantro and Mexican cheese mixed with diced onion.plate came with crispy potatoes and a side of meat in a small bowl.  We also ordered a “small” side of eggs with cheese for my son. 10/10 recommend!!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Food is always amazing. The crab cakes, ricotta pancakes, and burger was really good. Like is out the door starting at 10:30, so go early."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Quick to be seated even on for Saturday brunch service. Staff are all super friendly and the food comes pretty quickly! We had the challah french toast and 2 eggs with potatoes & toast, with a few sides. Very reasonable and good value portions. Bonus - bathroom is really clean."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great food! Great drinks! Friendly staff and pretty quick. Don’t worry about the long line, it moves fast and is worth it! Def try the potatoes! Probably the crispiest I’ve ever had. Really fresh food"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Visited this place a couple weeks ago. There was a big line but moved quick.  Ordered the Crab cake Benedict and the Challah Bread French toast.  The Crab cake had a nice texture  and the lemon dill sauce gave it a nice zest. Really liked the  combination.  But the star of the show was the Challah Bread French Toast. Can't go wrong with the combo of macadamia and mascarpone and bacon. Just a exciting and fun combination of flavours and textures. I felt it was more desserty but definitely worth coming back for.  I probably feel the portions for both could be bigger, but in terms of flavour it was pretty good and something different from your regular breakfast."
Mymy,1500 California St,"The French toast with fried chicken was pretty good but would have been better with either powdered sugar or whipped cream on the side. Lemon pancakes were very good. We also enjoyed their mimosas. Overall, very pleased."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Everything was exceptional! We got the Crab and Shrimp Cake Benedict, The Shrimp and Sausage Grits, the Crab Roll, the Banana Souffle Pancakes, and the Red Velvet Lattes with Oatmilk. It was delicious this is by far the best brunch place in sf! I love the amount of seafood options they have. I will be making my way back this week!"
Mymy,1500 California St,Brought my 12yo daughter for breakfast on our spring break trip after reading great reviews and enjoyed the food. We got corned beef hash and eggs with potatoes. Paid $55 for 2 plus tip. Seemed pricey. But food was good. Would have loved fresh squeezed orange juice. Its a tiny little restaurant so youre sitting close to others which feela cramped or like you have to whisper. The waiters service when I told him I didnt like acacados that were saucy on top of my eggs was appreciated. He had manager come and replace my plate with a new one. Attentive service which I appreciated. I would work to keep prices lower however for what you get. The toasted multi-grain bread was soo good. No parking. Don't even try. Come in an UBER or walk to avoid frustration.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Food is quite good but overpriced, mandatory 20% tips. You need to make reservation in advance"
Mymy,1500 California St,"1st time here. There was a line to come in, but it does move fast. The dining area is very small, and they have outdoor sitting. The food was good, portion sizes were of bigger portions. I'm not a fan of red velvet cake, but the red velvet latte here, WOW!! I say this is a must go to in SF. Plates average $22 each."
Mymy,1500 California St,Staff are super friendly and lines move very fast. We didn’t wait long before being seated. Food is above average but not good enough for me. There’s too much sweet sauce in waffle fried chicken dish and the crab cake Benedict is too salty. But I still want to come again to taste other dishes.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great place for brunch. We got there within a half hour of opening and it was already packed, but they had outdoor sitting that was perfect and we got seated right away.  The lattes were great tasting and good quality, and not overly sweet.  Husband had the Classic Eggs Benedict and I had the Norwegian Benedict. Both were delicious!  We don’t go to San Francisco all that often, but if ever back in the area we would definitely come back here."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Had the best ever French toast with fresh berries and cream. I took a chance at ordering a pistachio latte and was not disappointed. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Since I was on vacation, I wanted splurge a little . I would definitely come back if and whenever I should return to SF."
Mymy,1500 California St,Fantastic brunch destination. Seats inside and outside (we sat inside) and super tempting menu. The coffee menu includes a range of interesting latte options. We loved the red velvet latte and lavender latte. For brunch we couldn't decide between the Eggs Benedict with lobster and Eggs Benedict with crab and shrimp - so had both and it was a great choice. The breakfast potatoes served on the were also a must have.  Highly recommended.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Had the vanilla curd banana pancakes. One of the best pancakes I have ever had, especially liked what they did with the banana. Only downside is that it’s a bit expensive"
Mymy,1500 California St,Nice place. Service was quick and our food tasted good. The portion size was big. We came on a Monday so it was not busy at all
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great food, great customer service. They serve you plenty of food. Delicious delicious. Its a must to go spot! Get their early it gets busy. No reservations. Lobster Benedict and the crab cake Benedict are TOP favorite. Banana pancake 🥞so fluffy and delicious it melts in your mouth! PLEASE TRY IT"
Mymy,1500 California St,"The food is absolutely amazing, from the Chicken &French Toast to the banana pancakes, to the crab and shrimp Benedict. The service was great, and the atmosphere is fun. Must try place!!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Where do I start! The food here is A+++! We went twice! We had the French toast with fried chicken, banana pancakes, corn beef with potatoes and the crab Benedict. MY OH MY everything was delicious no complaints!"
Mymy,1500 California St,The vibe is so calming. I’m picking this place we were really liked the presentation of the food. As a family of 4 there was a minimum wait time of about 10 minutes. Everything was absolutely delicious. We walked about 10 minutes here and the area wasn’t as pleasant. The iced coffee was a bit watered down and our table was not so clean.. But this was worth the walk! Bathroom was also very clean which is important. I’d come back !
Mymy,1500 California St,"This spot serves more than just breakfast, but maaan! This was by far the best food I've had while visiting! I highly recommend"
Mymy,1500 California St,I love me some eggs Benedict. The choice for which one to get was difficult. I had the Norwegian and it was delicious. I hope to come back another time to try the other flavors. We enjoyed the energy of the place.
Mymy,1500 California St,"A must for breakfast. Well worth the wait. Loved everything, the shrimp and grits, the classic eggs Benedict, banana pancakes & French toast with berries. Oh and their breakfast potatoes were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. So good!"
Mymy,1500 California St,Delicious western breakfast. But the space is very small and you might have to wait a bit in the queue. But all worth it.
Mymy,1500 California St,"My expectations were set high after seeing the reviews and pictures, this place absolutely met them. Delicious food."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Awesome spot to grab a last minute weekend brunch. Seating is first come first served. We arrived on a Saturday around 11am and were seated after about a 15 min wait.  We ordered the Miss Mymy which comes with eggs, choice of pancakes, potatoes, and choice of meat. The zucchini ricotta pancakes were delicious and potatoes were perfectly seasoned! The matcha and red velvet lattes were good though a little difficult to drink in the square mugs. Nice big portions. Will definitely be back!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Service is super friendly, the place is good. Plan to be on line for a while. Parking can be hard. My concern that all the glasses and carafes are from plastic and is not consistent with the concept. Another think is that the apple cider is not warm and is super expensive for the tiny bottle of martinellis apple cider. I think that they can improve the concept by trying to really do everything from scratch. Good decorations on the dishes on flavor was nah."
Mymy,1500 California St,Pistachio latte is great. Mymy plate is pretty good! Montecristo is delicious!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Most amazing breakfast ever! Absolutely delicious, well prepared, well presented, good ingredients. Four of us ate, each having something different and every dish was fabulous.  One small negative. Call me old fashioned, but having to pay $120 for four of us to eat breakfast in a cafe smarted a bit."
Mymy,1500 California St,"I showed up first thing in the morning at 9am on Sunday and the place was completely filled already. I had to wait a bit for a seat for just one! The cafe is rather small and feels cramped from my perspective. Atmosphere aside, the food was delicious and I liked their blend of traditional and trendy breakfast menu items. IF you enjoy small places and you get a seat you will almost certainly enjoy this Nob Hill cafe."
Mymy,1500 California St,This meal was so delicious with gravy and this turkey fried into a French toast coat with jelly and the potatoes were so crunchy
Mymy,1500 California St,"A nice small but highly popular eatery on Nob Hill right by a cable car stop. The food is very tasty and the service is fine. The place is quite dense inside, so you overhear all, sometimes noisy conversations. There are also at least 6 covered booths outside and a few tables alongside the restaurant windows."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Delicious breakfast, worth every penny! I got MyMy breakfast with the lemon pancakes, bacon, potatoes, and over medium eggs, and it’s was so tasty! The crispness of the potatoes and bacon were perfect! Definitely would come here again and try other menu items too!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Beautifully crafted breakfast/brunch dishes that exceeded my expectations. We tried the Challah French toast with fresh fruits and caramelized walnuts, corn beef hash with two eggs and a green hollidaise sauce, and the zucchini pancakes."
Mymy,1500 California St,"I have been eyeing this cafe for a while now so was super excited to catch them this morning. The food and drinks were delicious! The service was attentive and efficient, we enjoyed ourselves. My wife and friend ordered the chicken and challah French toast and I ordered the tex mex scramble. It was an instagrammable worthy presentation and even better on the taste. Would definitely go back and recommend checking it out for yourself.  Pro tip: the lines may look long but they get through it really quick. Also, if you come before 9:30AM you don’t typically have to wait."
Mymy,1500 California St,"One of those it looks better than it tastes. It was ok. Wayy too heavy, soaking on butter and syrup. The strawberries were a bit mushy. Flavors are abit off, not delicate or satisfying, the aftertaste was weird.  There is cool booth seating outside.  Service is fast but we felt like they were trying to kick us out to serve the other people that were in the line.  Expects lines to eat here"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Service was top notch, just like their food. If you are coming to San Francisco please stop here for breakfast.. I got the crabcake Benedict and it was amazing. The potatoes were nicely fried although they lacked seasoning. I also got an order of French toast which was amazing."
Mymy,1500 California St,This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. They have excellent service and even better food.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone visiting San Francisco.  😃
Mymy,1500 California St,"Best breakfast!!  Right off the cable car line. I had the mymy with zucchini ricotta pancakes, my brother had the chilaquiles and french toast- everything was perfect, best breakfast we had during our trip. Service was outstanding and quick."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Solid breakfast spot. I got the corned beef hash, the meat was well cooked, juicy and tender and went well with the peppers and onions of the hash."
Mymy,1500 California St,Great breakfast and brunch restaurant that opens until 2pm. Their egg Benedict’s are good. Highly recommended!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Everything on the menu is delicious. My family loves this place. Extensive menu, lots of variety, but always very tasty. Typically has a wait but line moves quick."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Cute little breakfast spot, had a French toast and a pink and pistachio latte. Super delicious. Great service and a nice atmosphere ✨"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Walking into the restaurant I wasn't expecting much, but the smells were magnificent. From the Bloody Mary to the Red Velvet Latte, the drinks were on point.  The food was the star of the show. Eggs were perfectly cooked, the pork sausage was obviously made in house and the potatoes, oh the potatoes, light and fluffy inside and crispy on the outside. Wish we lived here just so we could become regulars."
Mymy,1500 California St,"First of all, stellar services. Very attentive and efficient. Secondly, the food is great. There's always a line but the establishment is quite spacious, so the line moves rather fast. There are also outdoor seatings. I got the smoked duck omelette and really like it!!! We also got the lemon souffle pancakes and they were good, huge portion and very fluffy."
Mymy,1500 California St,"As it was a lazy Sunday , my husband and myself decided to go on a breakfast adventure or should I say cafe hunting? And MyMy 😉 We are so pleased that we found this gold mine , we didn’t sit in ,we did a take out and we loved our breakfast choices , we ordered a crab 🦀 cake Benedict with lemon dill sauce and 2 eggs 🍳 🍳 any style . The pork patty is so fresh and so yummy and husband was bowled over the lemon dill sauce . We also took the cafe lattes which was really good as well . The pace has a indoor and a outdoor seating , plenty of tables to sit and a very friendly  staff ."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Mymy is a great place for brunch! Today I had the crab cake Benedict $20 with an IPA beer $5. With eggs Benedict, I like to pop the egg and let the yolk drip down all the way down to the bread. The crab cake had a pungent dill/lemon taste to it because of that green sauce on top. It is a distinct taste. The little crispy potatoes were OK. Not great. I would have preferred hashbrowns if it was available. Service was excellent and my food came out reasonably quick. I parked at a meter and it took exactly an hour from waiting on a table to finishing my food. Good job everyone at Mymy. I had a good brunch today."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Really delicious! Perhaps a bit pricey for breakfast, but completely worth it. Also going on weekdays is much better so you can avoid a long wait"
Mymy,1500 California St,My wife and I came here every weekend for years before we moved out of country. It’s so good that it’s the first place I go to whenever I’m back in town. Food is fantastic and the people are kind. Stopped in today after 3 years and they still remembered my order.  Menu recommendations: Everything. I have a particular affinity for the corned beef hash and the Tex Mex scramble.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Monte Cristo was not a Monte Cristo. First, it was made on the grill (flatop) no mention of this on the menu: no breading encashing or just a grilled sandwich. Second, even though the traditional raspberry jam was listed on the menu, I was instead given cheap strawberry jam. When I requested the raspberry jam, the cooks just pulled out the strawberry chunks. Finally, I asked if they had a raspberry jam, and the manager said they no longer carried it and it was a typo. He was very friendly about it, but I still feel like at least a small discount would have been appropriate."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Absolutely amazing. We showed up right as they opened and there was a short line. We were seated quickly, and our servers were very efficient. We tried a few of the dishes and all were delicious. I highly suggest the pistachio latte, crab cake Benedict, and the challah French toast. Totally worth the wait!"
Mymy,1500 California St,Great srvc Great menu & they have the best single breakfast dish w the dill crab cake Benedict. Maybe the quality of the crab cake itself can improve but still the best Benedict plate I seen in SF (imo)
Mymy,1500 California St,"I've never eaten pancakes so fluffy and light. The location is quite small, so parties of 2 will need to share a table for 4 with another party of 2.  Round 2 nearly two years later: INCREDIBLE. I cannot believe how phenomenal this food is. Line was about 25 minutes for a 10:30 Sunday brunch, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. Food was pricey, but WELL worth the price tag of $18-30/entree. If I could give 6 stars, I would."
Mymy,1500 California St,The banana souffle pancakes are beyond excellent…. ample portions will satisfy the hungriest visitor. If it’s a chilly day sit away from the door in the left corner. Service is efficient.
Mymy,1500 California St,"First off, my favorite thing about this place is the variety of specialty Benedict’s on the menu, an eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast. Everything was wonderful here from my chai latte to the smoked salmon Benedict (I forgot the name on the menu but it will be the only Benedict with smoked salmon.) Seriously every bite was delicious from the poached egg, to the crispy potatoes to the salmon itself. Even the rye bread was really good. My friend enjoyed her crab cake Benedict and pistachio latte, she even ordered a second latte. The third plate was an almost savory French toast, super delish but not too smothered in sweet. I wish I could afford to have breakfast here every day, I will be back for sure!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"I had a good experience in MyMy for brunch. Very good food and selection. The home fries are some of the best I've ever had.  For the price, it's not one of the top brunch spots I've been in the bay, but very solid and worth a look if you're looking for a nice brunch time."
Mymy,1500 California St,"An amazing breakfast! I had the banana souffle and it was really delicious. We were lucky that there wasn't a line, so we could sit immediately. There is outside seating, but might be a bit noisy with all the traffic. Prices are very reasonable"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Local place with great food! Always fresh and tasty fruit. Experimental brunch menu that’s worth exploring the unknown. There is outdoor seating and it’s cozy inside. Food comes out quickly too, very correct and efficient with orders. These have been some of the best home potatoes I’ve ever had, sometimes. The prices have gone up recently, but they give considerable portions. The seasonal fruit with pancakes is just 1 kind of fruit, not a mix as one might expect."
Mymy,1500 California St,So much dill.  They love their dill sauce which is fine and good but it's too much.  Salmon tartine was rich and luxurious.  Crab cakes weren't amazing and doused in too much dill sauce.  Coffee wasn't very good but orange juice is as delicious as reviews have said.  But what bothered me the most was that the volume of the wait staff talking and joking amongst themselves was louder than the kitchen and customers put together that made the atmosphere awkward.
Mymy,1500 California St,Amazing pancakes! Worth every calorie of it. It’s very busy so get there earlier. You do sit very closely to everyone so we were not lucky with our loud neighbors but there is nothing anyone could do about it..
Mymy,1500 California St,"(Visit 8/5/17) Got the french toast, crab cake as a side and a latte. The Challah bread was soft and very flavorful. It was topped with strawberries, and a cream sauce. It definitely complemented the french toast well. The crab cakes were amazing. They were topped with some sort of pesto mayo based sauce. Couldn't get enough of the crab cakes. Lastly,  the latte was sweet yet strong. Which is how I like it. The place is small, but clean. The staff was very friendly and service was fast."
Mymy,1500 California St,"line was justifiedly long but we were seated fairly shortly upon arriving. great presentation and even better flavour, french toast was one of the best i’ve had. mimosa wasn’t bad but a little overpriced. bf enjoyed his omelette though and overall food was great"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Food overall was pretty good, but the banana soufflé pancakes were not soufflé - just regular pancakes. This was especially disappointing because we had ordered them precisely because they were soufflé.  Salmon tartine was good, though very creamy/saucy. There is cream cheese AND a thick cream dill sauce on top so this masked the flavorful- ness of the dish a bit. Would recommend getting the cream cheese or dill sauce on the side.  Service was efficient, but not very friendly. I think our server was in a bad mood that day, which I understand happens from time to time."
Mymy,1500 California St,Delicious breakfast location with great atmosphere and respectable prices. Will definitely go back!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Had an omelette, had three pieces of sausage all the rest was onions, not good my wife and daughter got their food and I waited 10 minutes to get mine.  Don’t go off of other star ratings, that is what we did and very disappointed"
Mymy,1500 California St,Rude staff. We waited online for more than 10 min outside where she rudely told to go and it was dusty outside because there was construction going in front of the restaurant. We asked one of the staff when we will be seated but she yelled at us saying she had not time for that. We asked why she was yelling she said she was not and she didn’t have time to seat us. Her attitude towards customers was not at all pleasant and we left because we didn’t want to deal with such person. I hope you can train her on how to deal with customers.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Pancakes and bacon were good, but $20 good? Not really. Service was spotty. Little too pricey for breakfast food. You will get good food, just be prepared to pay a premium. Moderate recommendation"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Brunch food was good along with their hot lattes, however I don’t really see the hype and would not wait longer then maybe 15 mins. Guess it was good to come once and try it out."
Mymy,1500 California St,I will definitely be back. I got the Miss Mymy that included ricotta zucchini pancakes (yum!). Eggs were perfectly poached. Mango mimosas were great. I'm looking forward to trying more things on the menu.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great food. We asked to sit at a different table because it was in the sun and we were a little cold from waiting out side, they had no issue. Service was friendly and quick. Food was hot and fresh. Everything had a good flavor and presentation. I wish they had sourdough toast but no biggie."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Best breakfast in the Nob Hill neighbourhood!!! Don't go if you're on a diet. But if you like your bread, your eggs, your avocado, your tomatoes and a proper fry-up, this is the spot. Sit outdoors and watch people negotiate San Fran hill-parking!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"We were told to go here by a local to SF….. I’m glad that we endured the 15 minute walk with hangry kids!  The food was great, and the portions were enormous!  It’s well worth the wait if you have one when you get there."
Mymy,1500 California St,"The food here is delicious! Large serving, so much we couldn’t finish our meals. Food was fresh, warm, & tasteful. Serve was friendly and timely. I would recommend Mymy ."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Mymy coffee shop is our favorite brunch place , today we had chilaquiles verdes, challah bread French toast and dirty chai. Everything was perfect food, service and ambiance. French toast very savory and verdes have real Mexican taste. Also home fries is super crispy and perfectly seasoning. Will come back and try something more."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Long wait on a Saturday around 11, but worthwhile. Very good food, kind and attentive staff."
Mymy,1500 California St,"I'm a huge potato fan, and the home fries here are right on target. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The crab and shrimp eggs benedict were beautifully executed. My waitress was also very friendly."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Huckleberry's on Cleveland Ave is great.  We have been there twice and had the same server (waitress) who is awesome.  Don't know her name, but she has dark hair with a really skinny pony-tail.  Excellent food, excellent service!"
Mymy,1500 California St,This place is absolutely delicious. Great feeling outdoor tables and excellent customer service. Best brunch dishes specially French toasts
Mymy,1500 California St,Outdoor ambience was great. Food is not too bad. Tex Mex Scramble is good and worth the price.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Came here for breakfast and was pleasantly greeted by a long, but fast line. It was def worth the wait as my Chilaquiles and my latté were delicious. The potatoes were well seasoned and crisped to perfection. The pulled pork was amazing. As someone who usually avoids pork, this was worth the 5 mile walk later. The verde guacamole salsa that the chilaquiles is generously topped with had a good spice level, enough onions and it complimented the rest of the dish well. My friends got the pancakes and and an omelette both of which were very good. Be aware they do not do substitutions here, what’s on the menu is what you get. But you will not be disappointed."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Pretty good but not in a rush to come back, seems overpriced. I liked the zucchini pancakes, they’re an unusual menu item. Orange juice was terrible, service felt rushed."
Mymy,1500 California St,"The servers were amazingly attentive and had great suggestions for the food - which was also stunningly good. We had the lobster roll and fried chicken challah french toast with red velvet and ube lattes and mango mimosa. For a last minute pick, this ended up being a gem that I would not hesitate to go back to"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Got takeout here and it was the best brunch I’ve had in a while! Loved the pancakes, crispy potatoes and eggs!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"We visited San Francisco over the Memorial Day weekend and decided to check this place out after the numerous reviews I read online. I’ll have to admit-I am so glad we tried this place! I took my parents and they absolutely loved it. We still talk about our meal till today (mainly because the total on our bill took us to surprise lol) but this place still deserves a 5 star rating. We ordered the Norwegian eggs Benedict, the Baja California eggs Benedict and the Banana soufflé pancakes. We were 3 people and the meal was perfect. Make sure to get potatoes with your eggs Benedict as they are literally to die for. I have no idea how they make them but you just can’t stop eating those potatoes. If I visit San Francisco again I’ll definitely come eat here again! Be ready to wait in a line though!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Delicious eggs benedict! Both the BLT and the dungeness crab are super tasty and quite big (two plates can probably feed 3 people).  There's usually a line outside, but goes quite fast. The service could be a bit faster too. Coffee is the usual American weak-ish dinner coffee."
Mymy,1500 California St,Amazing breakfast! We read a review about the lemon cottage cheese pancakes so had to check it out. Definitely a win! The other was challah french toast. Both were delicious and our server was so friendly and inviting. Visit if you love breakfast!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Absolutely delicious food with large portions! Their crew hustles, but still expect a line with somewhere this good."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great, filling and affordable breakfast. There’s usually a wait but we got seated for a table of 2 in about 5-10 mins. The Norwegian Benedict was amazing. The OG is freshly squeezed and is a must!! Country potatoes too!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Very great place to start your day, whether you're visiting or a local. The food is wonderful, service friendly, and portions very generous. Pricing is moderate but it's excellent quality food. Juices are all hand squeezed and fresh. It's a very small place. Very small, like 15 tables. So there can be a small weight. But it is worth it. The fresh lemonade is really really really good."
Mymy,1500 California St,"We had souffle  pancakes which was good but not the traditional fluffy souffle pancakes that I know. Also had the Frisco omelet which was just alright. Our server  was trying to be a hostess and wait on tables at the same time but struggling to do both. So expect to wait.  They need to hire more servers.  Still, I give her an A for effort."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Pros: wide variety of breakfast-y foods. Everything is tasty, and portion sizes are decent.  Cons: it’s another overpriced brunch spot (to be expected in sf), it’s crowded, hard to get good seating, hard to park."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Generous portions of delicious American brunch. Coffee/espresso products are a bit bland.  Shrimp w grits: grilled shrimp, red sausage, two poached eggs, brussel sprouts and salsa fresca over cheese grits. Served with toast. Solid dish. $17.5  Banana pancakes: chestnuts, bananas, egg white merengue. The merengue was a bit excessive, but it's filling. $13  Coffee: free refills but it's watery and bland  Latte: again, they seem to serve bland caffeine products"
Mymy,1500 California St,Absolutely perfect food. We had the banana soufflé pancakes and an omelette. The crispy potatoes were also great. Highly recommend.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Delicious anniversary breakfast.  Very accommodating.  Had a brief wait for this cozy little restaurant, but service was fast.  Asked if I could get a side of fried chicken with my French toast (which was delicious) and lots of fresh fruit, also asked if they could make us a velvet latte w/out coffee.  They happily accommodated every request and service with a smile!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"Nice breakfast place. You'll have to wait in line for a while. I liked the benediction, we tried two of them and both were good. Pancakes are good as well. Service is a bit slow."
Mymy,1500 California St,Food was okay. A 20% gratuity was auto added to our bill without notifying us. We ended up paying $40+ for gratuity and tips for a $100 meal
Mymy,1500 California St,"The food was great. We had to wait a bit to be seated (20 min) but we came on a Saturday morning, so probably during the week people don’t have to wait that long."
Mymy,1500 California St,"One of the best eggs benedict that I’ve had in SF. We tried the salmon benedict and the dungeoness crab benedict- both were delicious. There is usually a line out front during the weekends, but the wait is definitely worth it."
Mymy,1500 California St,"My experience at the restaurant was horrible. Waited in the line for 10 minutes without anybody acknowledging us. When we asked when we’re gonna be seated we were rude reply that she doesn’t have time for us. When we asked why, she was yelling at us yelling she said she was not when clearly she was. I would not recommend going here."
Mymy,1500 California St,"The service was great. I went for brunch and it was busy, so we did a line for 40 minutes. I was happy they had Almond milk hot chocolate. I also order the crab cakes Benedict, it was ok. I could barely taste the crab but the presentation was good."
Mymy,1500 California St,"This place is amaizing!! I love their food , especially their place Tex-Mex it's the best for me their  food is delicious!!!  Everything is fast  , You have to make line but not for long time ."
Mymy,1500 California St,Delicious breakfast spot with patio tables available. I recommend ordering the Tex-Mex Scramble and the Lemon Dill Crab Cakes Benedict. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also pretty tasty! Beware there can be a long line on the weekends!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great location, nice sunny terrace. Friendly and helpful staff. The food is very tasty, the plates are huge. Various eggs Benedict, all delicious!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"I was there for breakfast, order benedict lime dill and Pancakes, the pancake was great, the benedict was average"
Mymy,1500 California St,The staff waa very friendly. Food was gorgeous AND delicious! Almost too pretty eat! It was very clean and Covid restriction compliant. The entire atmosphere was warm and welcoming!
Mymy,1500 California St,Mannnnn this place was GREAT. Everything fresh and good. 6 of us ate here on Vacation. Was definitely impressed.
Mymy,1500 California St,"I came here for brunch with a friend on a Sunday morning. The service was great. As soon as we walked in we were asked if we wanted to dine inside or outside. We both figured we dine inside since it was pretty cold outside. We were seated next to the window and given menus. My friend already knew what she wanted since she's pretty much a regular here. It was my first time, so I had to look over the menu. I contemplated on the Tex-Mex Scramble but ended up getting the Challah Bread French Toast. This menu item comes with Mascarpone sweet cream, roasted macadamia, seasonal fruits, bacon (but you can ask them to not include the bacon), and maple. I also got a mimosa with orange juice.  The Challah Bread French Toast was amazing! It wasn't even sweet which I'm so thankful for. Too many restaurants had tons of sugar in their food items, I'm so glad this place doesn't. My food was very mildly sweet and the mixture of the French toast with the sweet cream, macadamia, and maple was just simply delicious! My friend and I really enjoyed our mimosas as well."
Mymy,1500 California St,The staff is rude!! We came and there were three other people who came the same time and one of the staff rudely said don’t  stand here line up behind the robe. The sign that says to line up was not visible but we stood behind it after she yelled. Staff moved in and out serving other customers after 10 min standing in line I asked if someone can seat us to one of the staff. She yelled at me saying she does have time and can’t seat us I asked her why she was yelling I asked because we were standing for a while and we could see tables open. She kept yelling she has no time!. We wasted time and while we were standing outside there was construction work going on and we got dusts all over us. I think her attitude and the way she talked to us was not appropriate and we got offended and left.
Mymy,1500 California St,"Very Small Coffee House down the corner between Larkin Street & California Street.  Came around 10am in the morning and there was already short queue. We waited for approximately 20mins before getting our table.  The menu selection was quite alot to choose from.  The portion was generous, so if you dont eat alot of breakfast, I recommend you to share.  The staff was very friendly and proactive."
Mymy,1500 California St,I'm sorry but this was not that good. Very average and not worth the hype or even stay in line. Also don't eat in those boxes outside because it smells like pee. Overall overpriced and not satisfied.
Mymy,1500 California St,Food was delicious and the service was great thanks Pond keep up the good work!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Tasty fresh-squeezed juice, and my langoustine omelet had plenty of meat in it. Cheese was generic and thick, though. Very crisp potatoes but soft on the inside. Annoying system where you have to wait in a line outside to get a seat, but it moved very quickly."
Mymy,1500 California St,Chose this place by recommendations and tried their mex scramble and lemon ricotta pancake. I have to say they they really did live up to the hype. The scrambled eggs were flavourful and the hash was the bomb!! The ricotta pancake was soft and fluffy. Almost soufflé like. Overall a lovely place. Be sure to get there early as the queue builds up especially on weekends!
Mymy,1500 California St,"3.5 stars  We tried to choose a place for brunch which didn’t have an insane wait on a Sunday morning. We yelped this place, called in and found that the wait was only about 30 minutes. When we arrived, we found out that you have to stand in line and that there is no wait list. Since the line wasn’t super long, we decided to wait.  We got the lemon dill shrimp cake which was pretty good. The crab/shrimp cake was surprisingly good and the lemon dill hollandaise was not bad. I wish it was a little more lemon-y or dill-y though. There was just a hint. They didn't give us a giant sheet of hash browns which is what we were expecting (from yelp pics), but we got house potatoes instead. They were actually pretty good, but we had our hearts set on a giant hash brown. We also go the lemon ricotta soufflé pancake which I was really excited about, but was kind of disappointed with. It just tasted more like eggs, less like pancakes and barely any lemon flavor. Maybe I’m confused on what a soufflé pancake is, but it was just okay.  Overall, this place as okay food and the place is more homey and not as up to date as some other brunch places."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great food. Service is fast, fun and easy. Very small place, but tables turn pretty quickly.  Portions are huge, and the food is absolutely delicious."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Delicious! A wide variety of food choices and very satisfying meal. I had the crab cake Benedict with skillet potatoes and a lateé and it lasted me all day. Flavorful, large portion, affordable, great staff, clean, organized. It's a small space but the food packs a punch."
Mymy,1500 California St,We travel a lot and eat out a lot and are sort of proudly snobby foodies. This was fabulous.  Simply that.   Had shrimp and Dungeness crab Benedict With avacado. Perfectly cooked. Hollandaise was sublime.   Potatoes were amazing.  Friend had egges with cheese onion etc. also great.  Worth the wait. Service was great.   Highly highly recommend.  Go
Mymy,1500 California St,"Busy brunch place offering all the usual brunch dishes and some rarities. In particular, the lobster roll is to die for. Large portions and really fast service. Be warned that they don't have a waiting list, so get ready to stand in line to get in!"
Mymy,1500 California St,"The potatoes are so good you won't believe your taste buds, perfectly made egg Benedict's, and the fluffiest souffle pancakes!! good service but always a little crowded, worth the wait though"
Mymy,1500 California St,Really jummy but it was a bit cold where we were sitting
Mymy,1500 California St,Only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I want to keep it a secret. The service was excellent. The food was amazing! The prices weren't outrageous for the quality. This is now my favorite place in San Fransisco!!
Mymy,1500 California St,Great breakfast! Lovely staff and really great selection of food. The pancakes are awesome.
Mymy,1500 California St,Wow these eggs were fantastic. Fav brunch I ate while visiting San Fran.
Mymy,1500 California St,Absolutely delicious food.  Wonderful friendly service.
Mymy,1500 California St,"My reason for this 2 star rating is legitimate and I believe the employees need to get it right and pay attention to the customer and own up to what they messed up. My wife and I were visiting San Francisco and we were looking for very good breakfast spots. Found this one as the reviews seemed pretty decent. Well, of course it is a bit chilly so it’s not their fault. However, I believe they should make sure there are heaters outside even on one side. Ok,I was on. Next thing, if you take a look at my photo, I have two areas marked in red. My reason for doing this was because our waitress gave us a problem. My wife specifically asked and even read the menu item, CHICKEN N CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST. The waitress heard and marked it. Once my wife got her order, it was only the challah French toast and no chicken. My wife asked where the chicken was and the waitress insisted that my wife didn’t say that. Ok, instead of apologizing, she basically said we can fix this by giving you a piece of chicken which sounded like an extra cost when it shouldn’t have been in the first place. I could be wrong but again, it’s what it sound like. Not only that, if you look at the photo again, the waitress said it doesn’t come with the salad or potatoes. If it doesn’t, why is that in the same section with either meal (with and without chicken)? I ordered the Florentine Breakfast Sando and mine came with the potatoes. So once again, I’m not understanding why it doesn’t fall under the same category. Please fix this on the menu if it’s incorrect and teach the employees to apologize for their mistake when delivering customer service!"
Mymy,1500 California St,Fantastic food but long wait and outdoor seating left much to be desired. Tables were small and the booths gave no privacy to the table next to us.
Mymy,1500 California St,Ate here for the first time and the food is amazing. I recommend trying them out whenever you're in the area. Their menu selection is amazing and the prices are affordable.
Mymy,1500 California St,Holy smokes. EAT HERE! Awesome breakfast spot. The presentation of the food is awesome right down to the white fiestaware. I bet the wait can be long but I got right in. Ordered the tex Mex scramble and it's incredible. Good flavor. Also food was at the table in like 5 minutes. Staff is also very friendly. Stop in. Eat here. Haven't even finished my food before I started this review.
Mymy,1500 California St,Great service and great food.  Wait was only a few minutes.  Inside was a bit cramped
Mymy,1500 California St,Great breakfast spot with some really great options. The food is delicious and very nice to look at!
Mymy,1500 California St,"Wonderful find. During our month-long stay in the City, we had occasion to grab breakfast at many places and enjoyed most of our meals. Out of all the breakfast places, we found Mymy to serve the most scrumptious breakfast. My son had the Flatiron Steak and Benedict with Chimichurri sauce. The steak was a perfect medium rare ... nice reddish pink without bleeding and well seasoned. The eggs were poached to perfection with a nice run of the yolk after the cut. The sauce was a savory compliment to the dish. Surprisingly, the equal star to the steak and eggs were the potatoes, which were crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. Swirl the potatoes in the runny yolk with a bite of the steak makes for a very yummy bite. I had the Challah Bread French Toast that was battered in mascarpone cream sauce. My goodness, it was heavenly. You could enjoy it without the syrup, but at that point might as well dunk each bite into the syrup and get a proper sugar rush. The dish was topped with a generous portion of fresh berries and almond slivers to balance each bite with freshness and texture. Thoroughly enjoyed this place. Get there early .... there is always a line and the place is rather cozy in size."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Love coming here for breakfast, the (mostly) Vietnamese staff is always friendly and ready to help.  Also the portions are very sufficient so you won’t need to eat until later that afternoon, so also great for brunch."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Great but not amazing. Definitely a good place to eat, can get packed but I’ve been to other places where the line was well worth it. My favorite here is there matcha green tea latte."
Mymy,1500 California St,"Worth the wait, near perfect breakie. The eggs are to kills for while the potatoes are to die for! My friend dragged me across the town for this, forever grateful! Oh by the way, next door coffee is very good too."
Mymy,1500 California St,I highly recommend this restaurant 👍🏻Delicious and beautiful breakfasts are guaranteed. The staff is polite.
Mymy,1500 California St,Overall service could be a lil better. Ordered shrimp and grits. Sausage and shrimps were cooked very well. Shrimp had good seasoning. Grits could have had a thicker consistency and did not like the sour cream combination. Would definitely go again to get a different experience
Mymy,1500 California St,Nice breakfast location with great food and decent portions.  Tables quite close together when seated outside. Worth a visit if your staying close by.
Mymy,1500 California St,What a joke.  Talk about getting over on me for my hard earned $30.  Yup.  Costed me $30 for these burnt pancakes and potato's and bacon. What a big disappointment and a waste of money😞 …
