Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Was looking at the menu and saw that they are one of the few spots that serve Beef Short Ribs, and figured I'd try it out. I did, and although they tasted Ok, it wasn't exactly what I expected. Nice size portions, but I'm not really a corn, and mashed potatoes type😂🤣. Those are the sides that come with the full dinner, and next time I'll ask if they can substitute👍. They claimed that my order was gonna be one of the final ones of the day, due to running out of food😳. Must be a really popular place, if that's the case. Next time hopefully they'll have the Scallops available.💯"
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,A spot on example of an unpretentious cheap eat in the tenderloin. Can't beat a prime rib dinner for $20 or a full lumberjack breakfast for less than $15.
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Best value for money fast home-cooking diner you can find this side of SF. No frills, quick but friendly service. Great for simple but satisfying dinners or breakfast."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Corn beef, liver and onions, short ribs and stuffed bell peppers!"
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"This is a regular hangout for me and my friends. American food, reasonably priced. Have been going there for 20 years.  It's a nice neighborhood spot."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"My first visit since they lost their lease on Hyde Street. There's a feel in the cafe that I don't like, aroma. Everyone seems to go quiet. I feel as though I let the air out in the the dinning room.  I'm glad I did take out, because something is not right."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,It was worth to have a Salmon steak 4 dinner cost 16 with tip n tx. Tosted bread w/butter r good The fish chowder soup r great 2. It only serve on friday .
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"The best spot for a straight up breakfast/dinner in the TL. Great prices/portions, quick/friendly service. Honestly if your looking for a tasty/affordable meal this is the place to go."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"This restaurant has been in business now for 25+ years.   Portions are great, food is excellent.  Will be a sad day for the Tenderloin, if it ever closes."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"I came with a friend. We both got the spaghetti and meat balls special. She brought out two huge plates with bread and butter. I asked for more butter. She came back with two tiny pats. Then she said ""Next time I charge you!"". Ok, so it's not Olive Garden. But the portions were so big we had to ask for take out containers."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"This one of the last type of restaurant in the Tenderloin district.  Today, Vietnamese food, sandwich shops and coffee places dominate the neighborhood.  The food served here is distinctively American food with large main dishes that are of the stick to your rib type affair and of average to better than average quality.  The soups tend to be on the salty side, the ""salad"" that comes with the complete dinner is lettuce with a tomato slice and gobs of thousand island dressing; oil  and vinegar are available, but you have to ask when you order.  Value is the top priority here; veg consists of canned corn, peas or carrots, instant mashed potatoes + your main dish.  Large portions, honest ingredients, home style meals are reasonable to inexpensive  make this a go to destination if you're in the area.  Once upon time, there were many such places in the neighborhood, but now, somehow, it has survived and is the last man standing."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Still reasonable prices,yummy,big portion 2. Friend like the salmon 2. Add 1.50 ,U may have salad n everyday sp soup. Come w/family.  I will set this restaurant b my canteen ."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT AND THE PORTIONS WAS BIG ARE COMPANY HAD ARE THANKSGIVING DINNER HERE AND I WAS VERY EASED WITH EVERYTHING I CANT WAIT TO GO BACK AND EAT AGAIN I AM GOING TO BE EATING HERE QUIT OFTEN
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,This place was my first San Francisco greasy spoon and I loved it then and I love it even more now. The family that owns the place are great people. Place is kind of like a hofbrau. It is a pit stop for Senior citizens looking for a decent meal. It's old style like from the thirties.
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Great food for a good price. We experienced good customer service and was treated to a pleasant breakfast. No frills, just a large portion of good food. Large pancakes, big slice of bacon and eggs cooked to order. Great place to come if you’re in the Tenderloin district."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Very friendly and straight forward place. It's very clean & small in size but not cramped. American food like the ideal mom may've made at home. Full meals...soup & salad, dinner roll, then main course with potatoes, gravy and a cooked vegetable all for $8 - $13."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"I eat breakfast there a couple times a month,.  They give you a good breakfast at reasonable prices.  If you go there twice the owner/ waitress will remember you and usually what you ordered last time you were there.  I like that because she makes you feel welcomed.   Try it out, they have a decent sized menu for a small cafe as well."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,this is a great neighborhood diner. it's inexpensive and service is super fast
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Good Food.. but every time I go there, the service SUCKS. don't bother trying to get some A1 sauce. Last time I go here!!  M.W"
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"This place has the best fluffy pancakes in all of San Francisco. My friend and I both ordered the hot cakes with bacon and eggs. One side order of sausage and one side order of hash browns and a side order of toast for our eggs, which all three sides were plenty for us to share. A glass of o.j. each as well as a cup of coffee each  and our bill came to $30 and some change. Everything came out fantastic but the pancakes soared above all the rest. Great place for a breakfast meal. Excellent service but keep in mind we went around 2pm there was only two other tables so we definitely caught them at a no busy time. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking to find a cheap breakfast for two."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Love this place!  Friendly service and super reasonably priced food.  I've only been for breakfast but the pancakes, eggs, and French toast are great - nothing fancy but diner food done right!"
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Nice people, clean place and good portions for a killer price.  Nothing to take your girl out for a romamtic date but perfect for the big hunger after a busy day. The burgers are really good."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"I used to eat at the old location, on Hyde or Leavenworth, from '94-'05. I LOVE their omelettes and bread pudding. I was surprised to see they'd moved and I'll definitely miss the old location which once had a peace emanating Buddhist temple across the street. But was I ever so happy to see May, who's been here ever since then! I love that woman!!! And the other big surprise - the prices are still the same as back then!  I will always swing through Lafayette Coffee Shop when visiting SF for good old fashioned breakfasts. So much of what I loved of the City is gone, but not here. Thanks May and family for keeping some of the history of the SF I love alive!!!"
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"This is not a 5 star white table cloth kind of place.  It's a greasy spoon with with really good food, generous portions, and great prices.  The staff is friendly and the service is good."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Been coming here for around ten years and so far i have ""NEVER"" been disappointed with the food. The staff is great its a family run business that prides itself on customer service, the wait time for your food is about 10min depending what you order, the location is very clean."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Awesome place for a ""home cooked"" meal. Somehow the cook nanages to keep that ""institutional"" taste out if anything I have eaten from there. The daily special, offers three dishes, and a pretty descent selection of dishes a la carte. Lafayette's isn't the greatest place in San Francisco,   nor is it the prettiest place, nor is the location the greatest being in the Tenderloin,  but if you longing for some homemade food, at a reasonable cost then  give Lafayette's a try you might find yourself pleasantly surprised."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,Great place to eat great prices and great food and momma San cool to thanks🤗🤗🤗😁😁🥞🍗🥓🍔🥗🍧 …
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"The best real Tenderloin joint around. It was much more low key at it's original place on Hyde. However, the change of location is good and bad. Good because it seems newer. Bad because more people are learning about one of the most affordable, yet valuable joints, amongst all these unnecessarily, overpriced eateries."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Good portions, yummy coffee. Denver omelette and hash browns was really good."
Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Big serving ,great price, clean ,fast it's in walking distance from my work so I order there on my lunches."

Lafayette Coffee Shop,611 Larkin St,"Food is inexpensive and large in portion, but just tolerable for many items. But it is an old school place and for that I can forgive sometimes watery mashed potatoes."
