Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I can’t help but stop by Philz if I am in the area. The coffee is delicious. They have seating indoor and outdoor. There is a restroom. Oftentimes I come here when I am on my way to meet someone and arrived quicker than expected. I’ve also made intentional visits just to have the Philtered Soul. If you’re short on time, download the app to preorder."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Nice brewed coffee options. Beware, it’s not a espresso based type of coffee shop."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I am baffled at the great reviews for this place. I generally like Philz actual coffee, and this is a location with a decent amount of seating, but every time I have been here, the service has been awful. The staff will let you stand at the register for as long as they feel like it without acknowledging you, and your drink will take forever to be made. Yesterday, it took over 20 minutes to get a drink with only one order in front of mine. No acknowledgment even when I said hi or thank you.  You can have the best product out there, but if your staff and service stink, expect it to drive business away.  Don't bother here, there are plenty of other places in the area where you can get a coffee faster than your hair turns grey, and without the attitude and rudeness."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Great coffee, a colleague highly recommended the mint mojito and it was honestly so good! I hate the taste of coffee normally but thid was delicious."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Cool spot.  Nice staff.  Great coffee.  Didn't do stand up comedy there but I'm sure they would have laughed if I did.  5 stars!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Bad customer service! I was trying to check my order after 10 mins waiting and people after me already had their drinks. What I got is a lecture on every drink needs 5 mins. I had a little baby with me so I didn’t react to her bad attitude. Sigh.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Super cozy and nice spot near the ferry building to have relax afternoon coffee, specifically sit outside under the sun within breeze in any foggy-free summer days, together with someone  important to you ☀️"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Great ambiance and friendly people! Coming from an area without Philz I was excited to try it. Unfortunately I felt it was way too overhyped for what it was, but still recommend and see if you have a better experience."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"One of my favorite philz coffee locations in San Francisco. Lovely outdoor seating with a view to the Ferry Building. They run out of their delicious avocado toast very quickly, so better come early during the day."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I tried the chai latte. When they say it tastes earthy, it literally tastes like dirt. It was the most expensive and least favorite chai I’ve ever had. Tha staff at the truck were helpful but the chai taste was terrible."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Nor your typical coffee shop! The crew behind the counter keeps it fun while you wait. The Mocha Tesora was almost like Mexican champurrado.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,This coffee is delicious. Would you please consider expanding to the Kansas City market. I promise to be a loyal customer and brand ambassador.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The shop is nice, staff was friendly, although the coffee was okay. This probably comes down moreso to preference- I'm a big fan of creamy sweet coffees, and it was more limited to sugar or honey. The underlying flavor of the coffee was quite good, I would just like more options for sweet additions."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Great drinks. Got the iced coffee rosé and it’s one of the best coffee I’ve ever had.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Great place to get coffee! This was my go to spot on a recent trip. Their service is very fast for the quality of coffee they are making and the staff is friendly. The coffee is a very similar price to Starbucks and is 100x better. I wish we had a Philz in my town. Don’t miss it!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Worst customer service!!  Very rude and dismissive both days I visited. Had multiple staff behind counter but only one person assisting customers, resulting in a 30-minute wait. Manager could care less. Just stood there watching the line grow and didn’t help customers. Never coming back. Blue Bottle is across the street in the Ferry Building. Go there if you don’t want to be served by rude jerks."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,One of the largest Philz Coffee in the city and at the end of market street so it's not as crowded as other Philz locations. Friendly staff and good coffee and great place to study.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Absolutely fantastic staff.... Can't say enough! ""Phillz coffee... You're gonna like the way it tastes"" 🤙 …"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I just had a Philtered Soul that changed my life (cream, no sugar). This is far from my first Philz experience, and it’s always amazing, but this one was truly unforgettable. Well done Phil 👏 …"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Super friendly staff and makes the coffee with love. No, seriously, this is exactly what the staff told me with a big smile! They also have a nice outdoor seating area ☕"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"We were the only ones waiting in line and there were three baristas working on mobile orders and took them a few minutes to even acknowledge we were there. The internet is atrocious for the bay. Coffee was good, don't get me wrong. With Pete's and blue bottle just down the block I would probably skip this next time."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Always a fine cup--best in town!  Light roasts have more caffeine.  Great place to work too
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Imagine a perfectly roasted coffee, milk frothed to 160 degrees F, a just quirky enough atmosphere, and friendly baristas. Add a mint leaf on top, and you've got Philz Coffee. This is my go-to stop for coffee everytime I'm in SF!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Over $5 for a cup of coffee, but it was the best cup of coffee I recall having in a long time."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Friendly, quick, solid and consistent coffee! Recommended."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,I ordered mojito again - still beyond amazing! And the quinoa salad is healthy and tasty😚 …
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I like Philz Coffee in a basic way. This location is good to take a coffee to Ferry Building (It has only Peet's and Blue bottle). As well as other Philz, coffee is custom made for you, WiFi is okay, and staffs are friendly."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Great hip place to come have fresh individually made cops of drip coffee! Fun music & groovy atmosphere!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Very welcoming, quick service, and delicious coffee."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Awesome coffee great place to sit and relax on Saturday afternoon
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Even with noise reducing headphones, the music is extremely loud. I'm down for raves, but that's not what I go to Philz for."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,I got the “soo good” coffee which had mint leaves! It tasted great and I loved the vibe of the coffee shop. There’s free WiFi and bathrooms.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Always a dependable cup with easy ordering ahead via the app.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Great coffee everywhere here, but Philz is worth a visit"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Best coffee in town. Go for the Tantalizing Turkish with light sugar and cream.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"My favorite coffee whenever I visit SF. I always get Tessora or Ether. But today , Philtered Soul (cream, no sugar) just delighted my day. Thank you Philz!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Some of the best coffee I have ever had! Hands down better than Starbucks, Peet's, etc.  Coffee for the true connoisseur."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This is because zero stars is not an option. Awfull service, and worst place ever. Avoid!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Got the mocha tesora on the advice of a friend and I was not disappointed! Serious 🍫 🍫! Love this shop. Plenty of seating, great music and vibe. …"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Love Philz coffee! Try Iced Coffee Rose. It’s super awesome!!!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Tasty! Opens early! Ultra friendly staff! Fantastic from A to Z. Thank you.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Over priced. Almost $30 for 2 person and they get the coffee order wrong. Won't change it without charging you for the right order
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Superb coffee… San fransico style.. went well with Pork Suasage &Egg Burrito… downtown amazing coffee shop to visit.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,The only thing I'd ask of Philz would be to open one in MN! Mint mohito coffee and avocado toast is my choice.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Friendly staff, good iced teas. Just don't be in a hurry, because they brew each cup individually when you order, this isn't a quick coffee run."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,A bit interesting coffee place to visit. Got served nice and quick
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Great coffee! I love that the staff have their favorite drinks posted around the bar. It's great for someone indecisive like me 😂. I absolutely love the music they play as well. The atmosphere is personable and just all around comforting. If you want a fun and friendly coffee experience, come here. …"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Vanessa made an incredible hot gingersnap. Mm mm good.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Came here for the first time and received such genuine service from the staff. They took their time to make sure that I ordered the right ground coffee as intended and explained what made each blend unique. Tried the ether roast and was impressed with the bold flavor. Reflecting on their customer service, they even made sure that I was happy with my choice and guaranteed to provide something else at no charge if I wasn't satisfied. The location also is beautifully designed and decorated such that it is inviting and a great place if you want to meet with others or work inside or outdoors."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,The mojito iced coffee was out of the world. Located at the heart of SFO is just perfect to stop for a coffee.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"While I am a cold brew guy, their iced coffee is other worldly. Super friendly staff, even if there is a wait it is worth it."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Go to this Philz location for the coffee, not the food.  If you're hungry, eat someplace else first, then come here get yourself a cup of coffee.  Food wise, they didn't have a lot of selection to choose from in the first place. And what they did have, wasn't that great. I'd recommend Management change out the items they have in their display, as the ""sample"" sandwiches looked very unappetizing.  Also, although I like their choice in music, it's WAY too loud. If you go with someone else, having a conversation is difficult since you can't hear each other that well.  Not an ideal date spot if you're wanting to get to know someone.  One usually goes to a coffee shop for coffee, not food, and I get that.  But if you're going to want a snack, go somewhere either before or after."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The place is impeccably clean and elegant, and the staff is super friendly and professional - the only issue I have is that the coffee is burnt. No,  like this - BURNT. Please correct me if I'm wrong and it's supposed to be burnt and taste tartish-sour, but it was really, really burnt."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Great coffee, great music.  Good atmosphere.  The Jacobs wonderbar is tasty and dark."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I really like Philz, and the staff and ambience were great. But the pour over coffee wasn't good, it was under-extracted and had grounds in it."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Had a quiet bad experience- ordered rose coffee with less / lite sugar - got coffee that tasted horrible - went back to counter - the guy preparing at around 5:40pm on 11/19/22 was with a bad attitude problem and would not even consider that he made horrible coffee- ordered hot and said if you want sugar I can add - not understand that it is not hot anymore by the time this discussion concluded - hope Philz trains servers to happily replace drink if not done right - please check who was at counter at that time and fix this - thanks
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"GREAT staff, expert advice for tastes and preferences. Good drip coffee - reminder they have none of your typical espresso drinks.  I could do without the mint in all the drinks - adds a sort of pop I'm not fond of. Perhaps it's not in all the coffees though, and maybe depends on how slammed they are.  I'm in for the week at the hotel next door, and definitely going to ve coming back for more!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Jacob’s Wonderbar, Philz way (medium cream, medium sugar) I also get the Ancho chili breakfast burrito with an extra hot sauce (Tapatio). Usually 3-4 minute wait after order. Nice staff, convenient seating, public restroom (code required) never used the wifi but I’m sure they have it."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The drinks here are strong! I love coming here when I need a cup of coffee that will keep me awake and get me  through a long workday. Employees work quickly and are very friendly, don't be afraid to ask for recommendations they'll always tell you what they do to their personal favorites to make it even better! I like the laid back vibe, there are a few places to sit but it's not a coffee shop I would hang out at for long,  just a place to grab a quick cup and go back to work."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I went with one of my co-workers for our early pick me up for the day! She ordered a Julie's  Ultimate medium and I ordered  Julie's Ultimate large, the guy at the registered charged me for 2 mediums! I had no idea and we I told the varista that I ordered a large he was very rude almost refusing to make me the right size coffee and gave the ugliest look!!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Iced Mint Mojito is great!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Drinks good, friendly staff. However, they're not the cleanest store.  The cashier wore gloves while she rung up people and used the same gloves to touch food. Never changed them. She's protecting herself, but not the public. That's cross contamination. We are in a pandemic. I expect better. And what about the food handlers book? It says to not wear gloves while transactioning....  Also, coffee filters...sitting out in the open on the counter where people walk by and can touch, or debris can fall on it...why aren't they in a container?? That's hella gross 🤢"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Nice coffee, they can customize your brew any way you want"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Love Philz Coffee now that I have finally been able to visit! Have heard about this little chain before, but never had a chance to go. Super chill environment and most everything about the place is aesthetically pleasing! Great customer service and everything about the experience makes me want to return!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,In the last few times coming to this location only in the morning. I've gotten crappie customer service and a mean attitude from one particular lady. She wears clear frame glasses and has a tattoo on her inner right arm.. This morning I seen the evil coming out of her. And it's not even 7am yet...Welp never coming back here. But on the plus side The other 2 ladies are supper sweet.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The coffee is great, there is adequate seating area, and light snacks if you get hungry. Philz is more of a fast-casual place that you can grab coffee and go but it does have all the perks of a coffee shop with WiFi, outlets, and seating areas. This is a chain but it continues to have high quality coffee that they roast in house and wide variety (light, medium, dark roasts) to match your taste. They also have tea."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Nice atmosphere. One of the few coffee shops you don't need headphones. Fire mix!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,GREAT ~ PLACE ~ TO ~ TAKE ~ A ~ BRAKE
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Philz, if you know about it then you know why they have tremendous reviews. If your new in town, I couldn't recommend any other coffee to try first but Philz! It's delicous. Now the secret is they use heavy creamer for milk so if you are counting calories you can ask for different milk (which is what I do from time to time) otherwise enjoy the splurge :)"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I was looking for an afternoon caffeine boost and walked in expecting your regular cafe fare. The very different menu took me by surprise. The barista noticed my indecision and walked me through their top options -- and since this was my first visit to Philz, the drink was complimentary! 😊 fabulous service and a great hipster vibe . Excellent coffee too!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Ordered online and it worked out perfectly
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Loved the coffee here. The best coffee I had in SF
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Great coffee but slow service
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"My favorite Philz Coffee location. Great place to read, hang out with the friends and just to have the best coffee in San Francisco."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Fancy, perfect yummy coffee — made the way you like it. TIP: Download the app and order on the app to skip the line. The line is long — if your meeting someone here for a business meeting — plan extra time to wait in line, order, pay and wait for your coffee. THIS IS SLOW FOOD — and worth the wait."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This is not your typical coffee shop... it’s a fresh, unique experience that will leave you wanting more. Unlike other coffee places, each cup of coffee here is made fresh just for you. You get to choose from several different brews, which are separated into dark, medium and light roasts. If you’re not sure what’s right for you, the baristas are ready with suggestions and are very patient and helpful. Grab a fresh pastry to enjoy with your fresh brew, and you’re good to go! The food is good, and the coffee is great! I only wish this chain existed closer to home, too!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Delicious coffees and friendly staff, but minus a star due to the reduced selection compared to all other Philz I've visited.  Also, not that much seating.  Luckily they still offer Mint Mojitos.  Delicious... and they pack quite the caffeine punch, as do pretty much all the Philz coffee drinks :D"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Overhyped coffee. Cold coffee lacked taste and felt underbrewed. The place had so many workers yet it was unkempt.  The menu could be better given so many choices can be made out of a coffee. Seven eleven coffee would be a better option.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This coffee place is a local cult for coffee lovers. This is chain which has expanded quickly over the years so it's more accessible now than it was before. The story of the owner and his year's long dedication to his craft is admirable. This is the best location if you're right by the water, albeit a bit small for seating. Packed with long lines in the morning. Their signature drink is the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee. Perfect, refreshing drink in any weather."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Very relaxing, with none of the normal clanging coffee making noise I'd normally associate with a coffee shop, just soft slow music, seriously I could fall asleep right now. Pastries are light and delicious, staff are attentive & friendly, they seem to be genuinely happy working here."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Baristas are usually very friendly (cashier may not), and I like their fresh brewing coffee!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Coffee is great staff is also great just one young lady that has an attitude tremendously rude today she made my coffee and I seriously asked myself why should I come back for this? When she's a cashier also her mean expressions make me feel like regretting spending at Philz, I paid for my coffee and at the end of tired day all I want is to relax enjoy my coffee not her rude and mean face I don't know her name because usually staffers don't wear name tags.the rest of staffers are very polite"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Smooth coffee Medium is $4.50
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Coffee was Grand. Price was less than a Grand unlike their Corporate competition....LOL... Great service. Smiles all around.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,My favorite Philz location given that it's more out of the Financial district which means the lines are slightly shorter. It's better than the other location down on Market Street that is closer to the Montgomery station. This story is larger so there is more indoor seating. Also the decorations in this store are more pleasing to my eye. Wait time isn't too long and the coffee is still the same quality that I expect from all Philz locations.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Though signature coffee shop in heart of downtown San Francisco near Pier 1 but poorly maintained rest rooms. The coffee was not better than its competitors.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"They may make good cups of coffee, but they can't seem to make an iced tea. An order of black iced tea was served to me hot, in a paper cup. When I explained it was supposed to be iced, it was poured over ice and returned to the same hot paper cup. Ice immediately melted. When I realized that the tea had mint in it, even though I declined mint when it was offered, it was time to ask for a refund of the $3.50 I paid. All along the staff kept saying ""we want your cup to be perfect,"" but they couldn't seem to make that happen. Perhaps more attention to the product and less attention to the outrageous pink and lavender colored makeup on the (male) store manager."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,The staff at Phz on Market/Embarcadero made me a great iced ecstatic coffee on this warm weekend day. I was thrilled to get chilled. Thanks Philz
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This brand new Philz location in the Embarcadero Center has what it takes. Efficient store layout, friendly baristas, and most importantly, one of the best coffees the Bay Area has to offer.  My favorites are the Tantalizing Turkish and the Silken Splendor... always a delight.  I was part of the soft opening today and was able to chat with the amazing folks that work there. Go make it another awesome Philz location!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Very nice was treated with kindness they are very nice
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"It was my first time to US, and my friend took me here. The idea to line up for individual barista was a very unique concept that I have never seen anywhere else! Friendly staff, good vibes, free wifi (very useful for tourists like me), and great coffee. I really enjoyed their signature mint mojito iced coffee."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Yes and yum!  This is some of the best coffee I've ever had and the service is always stellar. Their avocado toast is delightful and I am in love with one of the baristas.   Be sure to ask about their ""secret"" menu.  Nutty By Nature is my fav!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"No espresso. I know - some people like their coffee that way, and those people should be accepted and treated with respect and dignity... but you and I, dear reader, know that in some deep way it's wrong.  [For the avoidance of doubt: the first sentence of this review is the only part of the review that readers should treat seriously.]"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The best up and coming coffee place in the bay area! The coffee experiencie is tailored to you as the customer, so a barrista hears out your particular specifications before even starting to make your drink, and they focus only on your drink until it's done. I've had nothing but quality coffee here."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"They have amazing coffees, not sure where they are sourced from. The barista usually just ask you want kind of coffee you would like and they customize themselves to deliver amazing coffees. They have amazing cold coffees like Mint Mojito and hot coffees like Darker blends with medium cream."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Jacobs Wonderbar medium cream medium sugar. Best cup of coffee in San Francisco every time! A great tasting kick in the pants, when you need a little pick me up. Always cheerful pleasant and colorful staff."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Being a bit of a coffee snob, I never thought I would like let alone enjoy and savor slow drip coffee that has herbs and spices infused in it. Yet in between bouts of OCD on the proper grind for Espresso beans, use of a proper conical burr grinder, roasting beans at the correct temperature, and the right pour - there is still a wonderful obsession around a hand crafted slow drip coffee infused with an amazing amount of flavor and complexity.  If you're new to this coffee, I would go with Ambrosia Coffee of God.  Enjoy!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Pour over shop...  No lattes at all.  However, the coffee was great."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"What is wrong with every single employee? 4 employees took almost 10 minutes to make 4 cups of coffee with 9 people in line who hadn’t even ordered yet, completely relaxed (read: slow) and chatting to each other, totally unconcerned with the line not moving once in almost 10 minutes. Don’t bother coming here unless you love standing in line and have at least 20 minutes to wait for A SINGLE CUP OF COFFEE"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Coffee is good as usual but it desperately needs more stuff. Every my visit I stay in lines, my orders are messed up, a person on counter reask several times and still do not provide what I want. Last time even worse I did not get all packages of coffee beans which I paid, so I had to return to the cafe ;(  plus, may be since it is crowded area, their restrooms are not clean."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,As it is here to San Francisco I I was told that this is a must visit. Very unique experience of having your blend of coffee and additives mixed by your very own barista. It's spendy. It takes a bit of time to get. If you have the time it's worth it. If you want to grab a coffee and go maybe look elsewhere.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"SF legend. Wish this spot had better merch but besides that, good seating and crew. Use the app and save some time!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Okay so let me start off by saying I'm not the world's biggest coffee drinker. With that said Phil's is by far one of the best coffee places in the city. The relaxed atmosphere as noticed in the wonderful mix-matched furniture, as well as the amazing baristas, who make your drink the way you like. if something seems off about the drink, guess what? They will re-make it for you. Nice selection of breakfast snacks and pastries. My go to drink is their Iced Green Tea, with mint of course, and a spot of almond milk!! Its the best way to wake up on the way to work!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Philz is loved for a good reason. Their mint mojito is perfect on a hot day. I also appreciate some of their darker cups. While not exactly a traditional cup of coffee, Philz always is consistent and the staff is welcoming."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Best chai tea and coffee (chocolate hazelnut) we've had in a long time! Very flavorful! The added mint on top adds a nice touch as well. YUM!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Love the coffee, excellent staff and recommendations, try ether coffee to start the day"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This is a strong and hearty location for the FiDi and tourist crowd alike. Although, I would like to think it swings more local-work crowd as the lines in the morning can get quite long. Try an iced Mocha Tesora instead of the usual Mint Mojito. Really, any of their coffee is tasty."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Got a recommendation for an iced Philtered Soul and it was very delicious. It's a hip location with nice interior. Outdoor seating in the summer will be great next to the Ferry Building and the palms.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"On the way from Hyatt Embarcadero to the pier, you will find a large, roomy coffee shop with inside and outside tables, decent coffee and food, a mini chain store based on Starbucks. Floor space allows quiet coversations and reflection."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"I've never had Philz Coffee before since I'm from Napa, and I asked the gentleman at the counter for a coffee on the sweeter side. He suggested to me the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee, saying it was a very sweet drink I would probably enjoy. At the time when he asked me if I liked it, I couldn't put into words what I was feeling. I hope you read this, I did thoroughly enjoy that reccomendation! The mint is what was causing me so much confusion, but the more I drank the coffee as the leaves sat the more I loved it! It has a nice creamy texture with a mixture of the ice melting makes it more enjoyable as you sip it. If I come back more often to San Francisco, I will definately be coming here as a ritual for when I visit! Staff is very friendly too if my review didn't show it enough. You guys made my morning! :)"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The coffee here is fantastic! If you get the beans to go, and want that same Philz taste, you'll have to have light brown sugar and heavy cream too for your beverage."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Absolutely a great coffee shop. Very good variety to choose from. Freshly ground and filtered naturally without pressure. Customer friendly..nice to hang out with friends or read alone.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Of San Francisco's great coffee shops -- Philz, Blue Bottle, Four Barrel -- I find that Philz is the one to which I return, again and again. Why? I find it's a deeper, richer flavor that doesn't go bitter if I let the brew sit for a while, say in a meeting.  I didn't even know that there was a Philz near the Ferry Building. I stumbled across it and felt compelled to run in and grab a cup. Philz trades in blends, which is my major complaint: I prefer single-source or single-country coffees. While I like some of Philz blends, it's the Ethiopian Harrar or Yergacheffe that make me smile. (Yes, there's usually at least one container of non-blend beans behind the baristas.)  This day it was labelled 'Ethiopian', but none of the employees could tell me exactly what it was. Neither the baristas front of house nor the back of house office staff had any idea. Teaching moment: your staff should know the minimum (at least) about what you're brewing.  So there it is: one tasty cup of coffee, one smile, one better day.  Disclaimer: I am acquainted with Jacob, Phil's son. When I managed our coffee habit at an office near the ballpark I negotiated with Jacob to meet our weekly coffee budget with a constantly-varying selection of Philz beans. It was magnificent!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Saw this place on a coffee documentary, so I was super psyched when I saw it from Muni.  Tried: 1. Mint Mojito iced coffee 2. Iced black coffee  The mint mojito was very good. It was creamy and had tons of fresh mint leaves.  The iced coffee was okay. It tasted just like iced coffee I can make at home (to be fair I use high quality beans at home).  I was disappointed they didn't have cold brewed coffee.  I gave it 5 stars because I'm not a good judge of iced coffee. I prefer and normally drink cold brewed :) The mint mojito was great.  Service was good. Good atmosphere and music."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Amazing coffee, great service! It's not fast, so don't go if you're in a hurry unless you pre-order. Good breakfast food at a reasonable price."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Favorite coffee place in SF. Whether you're a drip coffee person or not, get your coffee fix here. Light, medium and dark blends in AMAZING flavors, as well as tea and cold options, snacks and the nicest staff :)"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Prime location with tons of traffic, but they move things along quickly. Lots of space inside and outside to sit (if you can beat the remote workers to a spot). Staff is friendly and patient if you aren't sure what you want."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"It took a while to get our coffee, but apparently every cup is made fresh. The coffee itself is very tasty!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This is a super Philz. It has extensive indoor and outdoor seating, while offering an extensive setup of everything from coffee to alternative drinks and pastries. Given its location I think it draws a very eclectic crowd, blending locals and visitors from al walks of life. Really fun spot."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Good strong Arabic coffe blend. The Mediterranean toast was ok, not more and no less, and overpriced,  not filling (but they did substitute  the egg for hummus ). Service was good."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"We went to this location after the farmer's market on a Saturday morning. I've tried Blue Bottle before (which was sold inside the Embarcadero building) in NY so I wanted to check out Philz. And I have to say that it was yummy!!!  Gisselle was our barista and she provided us recommendations on drinks. We started off with the mint mojito and tesora. We didn't enjoy the tesora as much as the mint mojito and instead, we switched it to the iced chai. The staff and baristas are so kind and made my first experience at Philz.  The mint mojito had a good mixture of sweet and creamy and you can never go wrong with an iced chai. Check it out and for sure, try the mint mojito!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"My first Philz experience, in San Francisco where it all started, no less.  Conveniently located between the Ferry Marketplace & the Hyatt Regency where I stayed, Philz Coffee is known for crafting personalized coffee & tea, one cup at a time.  I've seen & heard references to Philz' mint mojito iced coffee drink, so I already had in mind what I wanted on my last morning in San Francisco.  Mint mojito (large, medium sweet)- Refreshing!  Medium sweetness was about the right level for me, as I usually have my coffee w/o sugar.  I dare not imagine a mint mojito at normal sweetness.  The coffee had low acidity, and exceptional flavor.  As I finished my drink, I noticed about a quarter of the cup full of mint leaves.  No skimping on mint at Philz!  I enjoyed my personally crafted cup of mint mojito, but I found at a price point of $5.50, it was rather small in portions.  I made sure to savor every last drop to get my complete money's worth.  Besides drinks, Philz has some exceptional looking pastries & savory food items for sale.  I was eyeing the avocado toast, but thought otherwise.  In a hurry?  Philz has a separate line for those that order ahead, expediting the process for the masses.  Service was good.  My barista was friendly & helped me decided upon the sweetness level.  She informed me to pay at the cashier & to keep my ears tuned in when she called out ""mint mojito, medium sweet."" The wait in the queue wasn't very long, and water is available to quench your thirst. Inside seating is via a few communal tables, couches & seats.  More seating available al fresco via tables with the Ferry Marketplace & the bay in eyesight.  I made a quick stroll here, so I'm unsure of the parking arrangements.  I haven't had my fill of Philz, just yet!  Philz Coffee brews an excellent cup o' Joe, not in large batches like some of the competition.  The mint mojito is a delicious drink, the popularity of which I can quite understand.  Big on flavor, I wish it was of a quantity to match.  Nevertheless, I was quite happy with my morning caffeine boost & I've become a fan of Philz.  Highly recommend! NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"The lady working at the counter was a pro and made me her best version of a decaf mint mojito even though it's not an official drink. It is a little sus outside, but I guess that's why they have a security guard inside."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Got remodeled few months ago. Very nice place to sit down and do work. Many plugs to charge computers or phones. And as always, tea and coffee are very delicious at any philiz coffee."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Philz Coffee is hands down the best place for coffee. The coffee is amazing, and the staff is always friendly. If there is a location near where I am at, it is my first choice for coffee. We drink Philz Coffee at home as well."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"This is one of my favorite Philz locations! It's the biggest store with the nicest staff and the most interesting parton's!! I've been to a lot of other locations; Berkeley, Walnut Creek, San Jose, Sac, San Bruno, Santa Clara... This Philz has it all and then some!!"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Large space with indoor and outdoor seats. Indoor 10 or so seats for working space. Friendly staff and great pour over coffees just like you would expect from good old Philz but snack selection too Starbucks'y
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Nicely located across the Ferry Building, next to the Hyatt Regency, Embarcadero BART station, California St Cable Car Line. Love that this Philz has plenty of outdoor seating besides indoor seating. Great place to people watch. My new Philz Coffee favorite is half medium roasted Silken Splendor and Philtered Soul with medium cream / sugar- taste like a creamy, smooth chocolate, nutty flavorful coffee. Learned about this combination after talking to the Philz barrista and telling him what I like.  He suggested that there were Philz coffee combos he could make. There is also larger pastry and half sandwich selection since the last time I was at a Philz. Get it heated or toasted if you can. Makes a big difference, especially when you order a flaky, buttery croissant. Bring how the flavor. This location has restrooms, but you have to ask for the code in order to use either mens or womens restrooms."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Great coffee. I especially love the iced mint mojito coffee and the ecstasy. Super high quality, there's something for everyone. Good avocado toast, too."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,The long line made me think that coffee would be orgasmic.  I was disappointed to discover that it was just ok. I did have a very patient barista and he asked all the right questions. Overall not worth a twenty plus minute wait.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Delicious coffee with a great location right off the pier.  Definitely worth the stop for some unique flavor combinations.  It was very busy when we were there but worth it!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Philz is more my style than places like Blue Bottle. The coffee is unique and delicious, but without pretension--or maybe just a more acceptable amount."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Had an amazing cup of coffee today at Philz.  Jacob's Wonderbar was everything they claimed; rich chocolate flavors and very smooth.  Ready for my next cup!
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Philz coffee is amazing (better than Starbucks). The coffee tastes rich especially the dark blends. I would highly recommend mint mojito.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Very clean and modern. Doesn't have that ""small coffee shop"" feel like some of the others, but I don't mind. The line is usually pretty long so I recommend using the OrderAhead app."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,It was great and their baristas we're lovely! I would happily come here again. I highly suggest the iced mocha. I was talked into it by one of the baristas and it was a wonder and a delight.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Bathrooms were overflowing with trash patio was had bird fecal all over the place doing the pensions very dirty store I don't recommend this place for anybody this place can give you a disease you're not careful
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"Enjoyable place. Good coffee. But really needs some more substantial choices - - protein foods like small egg, potato and tomato ""burrito"" style foods. Make ahead of time and refrigerate... Easy Peavy 🌞 …"
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"It's always nice to go the peer and come visit place. Coffe wise, I guess it's same philz as other places, but the place has a lot of seatings. Lots of comfy chairs, working area and outside seatings. And the bathroom is pretty clean, staffs are nice and the place is nicely located."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Right in the middle of everything. Just about every direction is something to do.  I believe all coffee is pour-over. Good stuff.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"As someone who loves strong, dark roast coffee, I love this place. Jacob's Wonderbar is my go-to. Lines get long so I recommend downloading the mobile app."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"From out of town, got a sooooo good coffee with cream. The cream somehow made the coffee thicker, almost like a latte. The coffee (as its name would suggest) was soooo good. And they put in a mint leaf! Definitely recommend."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,"One of the toughest choices is choosing from Philz or Blue Bottle. But you can never go wrong with Philz. The lines are usually long here,. But the baristas do a good job of interacting with customers waiting, and it makes it a lot shorter."
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Coffey brings ppls together 🤝 staff awsome always make my coffey on point because they dont mind opinions if taster bugs are being complicated 😝  ice rose w/ honey  😍 almost like the iced mint mojito😳 if you want to adventure in new flavors. …
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,I mean...it's fine.  Saw multiple homeless people entering the bathroom and doing drug deals that didn't make is feel very safe but the coffee was fine.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,It was good coffee. I did not realize it was only pour overs before I went and I like espresso beverages more. The pour over concept is unique and it was very fresh and tasty.
Philz Coffee,5 Embarcadero Ctr,Great baristas! Very friendly and helpful. Shop was clean and inviting. Great iced coffee!
