fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Pretty delicious coffee. Morning bun is a favorite for a snack. The room is clean and tidy and it’s never that busy where you’re waiting more than 5 mins for your order.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Nice coffee. I really liked the cappuccino and the lavender earl grey latte.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,This is my second time grabbing coffee at this coffee shop. They charged $5 for a latte and an additional $1 for the half and half. In most coffee shops this is $4.25 to $5 for the same order. The place is clean. You used to be able to sit in there pre-pandemic but not at the moment. It is well ventilated which is a plus.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Reasonably acceptable specialty coffee  and perhaps one of the better ones in San Francisco. Ordered a flat white only.  Milk was frothed slightly too hot for my liking.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"I love this neighborhood coffee shop, it is the one place in a few block radius where you can get a city-like coffee experience and great pastries.  They put in tables recently so you can sit with friends."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Best coffee shop I've been to in a while. The bathroom was very wheelchair accessible in a way that most other places don't make the effort. Great matcha latte and pleasant environment as well. Pastries from Craftsman and Wolves. For here drinks served in real glassware. Pretty perfect.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"This is a small, cozy place doing serious coffee as well as tea lattes. I had a regular latte here which was very nice - not among my personal favorites on SF but very well executed. The place is small and charming. I didn't try the pastries but they looked appetizing."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Five stars because my cortado was delicious. Great coffee, not an amazing location or anything special in terms of the decor."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"I’m pretty convinced this is the best coffee shop in the city. Their menu is simple and they do EVERYTHING on it to perfection. Their chai is not overly sweet and not made from gross powder (they actually steep tea to make a chai latte.) The espresso is top notch and expertly made. The staff is competent and welcoming. The space is clean and simple. And the prices are totally fair. I love supporting this little business and plan to continue returning often!!  Coming back to a couple years after leaving this review to double down on how great this place is. They make the best tea latte in the city- they even have a whole section of their menu devoted to tea latte.  The vibe is great, the baristas are top notch, they’ve brought back their indoor dining/study space. It’s just the best."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,I see the intent of the location. The place was meant to spruce up what came before. I can still see the plumbing and electrical wires in certain places. The ambiance is a bit bare in places. I would suggest populating it with some merchandising.  The coffee was good. The latte was light and foamy without too many large sized bubbles.  Parking would be a bit difficult at times. The location is just like that. Take a scooter or motorcycle.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Fire spot! Has wifi and outlets. Worked here for a few hours with a mocha alongside me! Very calm and easy to work or have a chat here. Definitely recommend!
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"This was the perfect spot to pop in for a nice flat whit and pick up a scrumptious blueberry muffin for my little one. They had a great bean in the hopper, and a good assortment of tea as well. Staff was friendly, and coffee was prepared quickly."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,We came here for boba tea but they don’t serve any.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"One of my favorite coffee shops in SF!  I am here around 3 times a week.  Typically get an oat cappuccino but when I’m in the mood, their mochas are the best that I have had in all my extensive cafe wandering.  The tea selections are also great."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Nice vibe. Good coffee. Great neighborhood spot.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,I came here once before and had a great experience - the staff was very kind and coffee was great. Second time was not the same and felt ignored the whole time until they reluctantly took my order.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"This is has been my local go-to coffee shop for years. It’s usually pretty busy, so don’t go there assuming you’ll get a spot to sit down unless you go early! The coffee and tea lattes are absolutely delicious—I’m a fan of the lavender and the coconut myself, and I love getting it with tapioca (which is only available after noon). The waitstaff are nice but not exceptionally friendly so I find myself over-smiling at them to win them over 😂"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Good coffee, quick service. I like how they have a focused menu. They had onyx coffee beans for sale when I visited which I'm a huge fan of. Would come back!"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"I moved to this neighborhood months before and only discovered this cute corner cafe after a friend raved about their coffee and tea. Trusting her, I gave this place a shot and now it has become one of my favorite coffee spots in the city.  Fifty/Fifty has a great staff and seems to be growing their menu options. Their coffee beans are from Ritual Coffee, and they can prepare it in different ways: standard drip, pour over, cold brew, etc. I am a big fan of their milk tea lattes, which can be done hot or cold. Their Match Green Tea Latte is delicious, as is the Jasmine and the Lavender Earl Grey. Tapioca/Boba is available after 12pm, and is the perfect chewy texture. They serve Dynamo Donuts too if you want to pair that tea or coffee with something sweet in the morning.  The best part: they take credit card, Apple Pay, and Android Pay through Square, which means I never have to worry about bringing cash. They have a great stamp card system too: one free drink after purchasing 10 drinks! It's a great place to grab a drink and chat with someone or get some reading done. On the warmer days, there is outdoor seating, with tables on the sidewalk."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Best coffee in the area. Opens early, ideal for both a quick coffee stop or if you need to work. Please be prepared for crowds during the weekends. 😊 Location: right next to bus 38 😊 Ambiance: small and petite but it offers good seating along the window as well as small tables (for 2) with plugs next door. 😊 F&B:  Ritual coffee made here is great. Very well brewed, the cappuccino are also very tasty with soy or almond and oats options.  Snacks: unable to taste anything as there's no vegan pastry. There's many habitués that come here as a testimony of how good their coffee is. WiFi: provided Outlets: Yes Time limits: none Big tables for meeting: none Bathroom: clean."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,I’m updating my review from 5 stars to 3. Mainly because we used to get really great tasting coffee from here. And for some reason since the Owner(I believe) is no longer there anymore the quality of has gone way down. This all start about 2-3 months ago not sure why.  I still enjoy coming here to pick up pastries.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Serving ritual coffee! Very nice people, fast service, laid back in here, super calm and quiet place to get some work done with great coffee! This is my favorite coffee shop in all of the Richmond Geary stretch. I usually drink coffee at home rather than buy coffee out because none of the other nearby shops have decent coffee , finally found a place that I can depend on when I'm out and about."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Great little coffee shop in the Richmond. Although it's small there is often enough seating and the bar stools at the window are great for people watching. They serve ritual coder and make good cappuccinos. They also have some amazing donuts including bacon maple.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Coming from Sydney and Melbourne where amazing espresso coffee is essentially taken for granted, SF seemed limited; just the well known Sight Glass, Four Barrel, Blue Bottle.  I reckon this little place on Geary is up there, if not the best coffee I've had in San Francisco.  They also serve lovely savory muffins and sweet treats."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Fifty/Fifty is my go-to coffee shop in the Richmond district. Service is always fast and friendly. It's small, and fairly popular so seating can sometimes be hard to come by, but I'm usually getting my drink to go, anyway. They serve a variety of drinks including boba teas. I mostly only go for the coffee. They serve Ritual Coffee Roasters, which is a good standard, imo. They offer a buy ten, get one free punch card which is always a plus!"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Great little coffee shop that's open nice and early. It's probably the only place I know where you can get milk tea at 7am (called tea lattes here). After noon, they have tapioca which you can add to any of your drinks! I love the honey lavender earl grey - it's excellent hot or cold. They also have a stellar hazelnut hot chocolate.  I've never gotten food here, but they have pastries that look so, so, good. The temptation is always there.  Service is always friendly and they often have interesting knick knacks on the shelves. I once saw what was essentially a grown-up coffee sippy cup and that was amazing!"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"A little pricier for coffee in the area, but the place has nice service, tall front windows to watch the street through, and excellent mochas without much sweetness. If you intend to stop through for a quick coffee and a bathroom, make sure you have whatever bathroom app is being used in the city for efficiency. I'm also not 100% sure they have drip coffee; the bulk of their coffee service seems to be in pourovers."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Honestly their tapioca is one of the best I've had in a long time. I got the lavender earl grey drink, took me a whole cup to realize how good that was - you need to really love the lavender flavor to like it."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"This cute shop has great to-go coffee and tea, including boba in the afternoon. I appreciate all of the options — almond, oat, and soy milks, as well as a decaf tea. The baristas are friendly, too! The only downside that there’s no seating nearby. Maybe there’ll be a parklet in the future, although this section of Geary has a lot of traffic."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Nice small little coffee/boba/pastry shop in the inner Richmond. It's a small shop that sits around a dozen people but it very clean and has a modern feel. The drinks and pastries are pretty good but always seem to sell out quickly. If you go here near closing time you'll notice they run out of items like boba or pastries in their entirety so you might be disappointed coming in too late.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Great find for coffee and natural boba drinks in the Richmond district.  Very sparse, minimalistic decor... Quiet place to chill, read or just hang out.  Ordered a matcha oatmilk boba drink along with a Thai ice tea with boba. Both were very good .. And the staff was quick and attentive."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Good Coffee and amazing Pastries. They don't make them here, but wherever they get them delivered from, they are awesome. The maple glazed doughnut with bacon on stop is highly recommended. Coffee and Teas are a little expensive, but very good."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Went here for the boba. They didn't have too many options, but I had heard good things and was still excited to check it out. They let me use my reusable cup, which I always appreciate. The boba and tea were good, would return if I was in the area."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Searched for the perfect matcha latte in this part of SF. This is it.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Good coffee.. you have to ask for a lid and whatnot but that seems pretty california. Prices are standard. They do not have decaf drip coffee so you have to pay a little more for a decaf americano. They do have almond and soy milk.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Their coffee, pastries, and boba are all yum yum yum! Their staff is also friendly and helpful. The space is a bit small, but can be a fun place to get some work done. The wifi is free and reliable and the atmosphere is generally serene. Sometimes I wish I could kick out the kids that show up there haha, but sadly this place is just too family friendly!"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Fast, friendly, bright little place with Ritual Coffee and daily fresh pastries from high-end  local bakeries such as Dynamo. A place you can count on for consistently good expresso drinks. Also fresh Ritual Coffee beans for sale."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Awesome ambiance and AMAZING coffee. Get the dirty iced chai with oatmilk. Great spicy notes and amazing with a donut too! Baristas Nick and Kallie were amazingly accommodating and beaming with warmth and smiles! 10/10
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Yum yum yum best mocha ever... I hate when they are made overly sweet.... They also use Ritual Roasters beans, bonus!  Awesome gluten free donuts from some place in the Mission."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Hands down the best cafe in San Francisco. This place has incredible coffee and matcha, and a modern yet comfortable atmosphere. Higher-end pricing for coffee, but most definitely worth it."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Super slow service that seemed preety disorganized. Watched the staff put up a drink that had Boba that wasn't supposed to have Boba.  Rather than remake the order, they staff member just poured into another cup and strained out the Boba.  Pretty sure that drink tasted differently than the customer wanted. Also, they still use plastic straws if that's your thing. Craftsman and wolves pastries.  Probably OK for drinks that aren't too complicated or if they aren't juggling a lot of orders."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Super cute local coffee shop. Love theor vanilla flat white.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Nice place for a wake coffee, macha,mocha"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Great cappuccino; high quality coffee/espresso beans. Almond croissant and ham and cheese croissant were very tasty and can tell are made with real/whole ingredients.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,By far one of the best coffee shops in the city. Espresso shots are always pulled perfectly - never bitter or sour - and the milk foam is some of the best I've seen.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Went for a quick drink. I had the honey coconut which I highly recommend 10/10. Bit pricy tho
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Cute little coffee shop with modern decor. Their pastries were delicious and they open early at 7am! I got their jasmine green tea and mushroom&onion savory pastry~
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Favorite small coffee shop in the city. One of my favorite cold brews anywhere.  Serving ritual coffee and delicious baked goods, including Dynamo donuts. Sooo good."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Cute little coffee shop. Very small with limited selection.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"This place is the ideal coffee shop for meeting a friend or getting some work done. They've got great coffee, tea, and food, and the shop is well designed with a nice, laid back atmosphere."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Cafe serves Ritual Coffee brand. I ordered Coffee and Chai and both were satisfying. Cafe has 5 tables and a window counter seating area. Located on Geary and Spruce
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Small cafe along an otherwise uninspiring stretch of Geary. A good selection of drinks and a great pastry cupboard! You can't miss the orange van parked outside.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,The cofee is very good. It's nice small place with few pastries. I love the quietness of this place compared to othe cafe's where it's hard to hear the person next to you.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Dynamo donuts and Ritual coffee, this small corner spot has the good stuff. Tends to attract the laptop mafia, but the window seats are nice."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,This place serves solid coffee and fresh-baked pastries (I recommend the cheese and chive biscuit). The staff are friendly and it has a neighborhood feel to it.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"The Baked goods come from A shop in Palo Alto... Best in the Bay, han n chz bangerz"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,My preferred neighborhood coffee shop. Free WiFi and bathroom in a small but airy shop. Airways has great coffee

fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Lovely little space with nice WiFi access. They have great coffee, dynamo donuts and milk tea boba all in one place."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Great coffee and pastries and they even sell Heart from Portland who is an amazing roaster.

fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Consistently great coffee and a small but excellent selection of snacks (Dynamo donut's and pastries from Le Marais). A frequent stop on the way to work.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Excellent boba teas as well as hand crafted pour overs make this one of our favorite stops in SF.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Great local spot for pour over and espresso drinks. Their mango boba tea is also delicious.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,They use Jasmine tea for their matcha latte which gives it a floral note and makes it quite delightful.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"One of the worst places I’ve been. Quality does not seem so good, but they charge so much!! $5 is way too expensive for just sone average drink."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,My neighbourhood coffee shop that I usually stop by along the walk to work. I like their lavender Earl grey latte.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Coffee is good not great. Outdoor parked was simple but nice.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Great coffee, comfortable interior. There's a fifty/fifty chance here that there will be empty seating next time ;-)"
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Small but cozy space with great lattes and baked goods. I'd recommend the banana bread. 🍌 🍞👌 …

fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"The gentleman who helped me was so nice.  He was able to pull up all my info from 7 years ago in Reno, and even give me a small discount."

fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,My favorite coffee place in SF (and I've tried a lot of the more highfalutin places around here)!
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,Tasty grab and go coffee. A small selection of pastries. A few tables for those that want to sit and sip.
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,"Hole in the wall place, with only coffee and cold pastries. I'd hope they would have heated up my ham & swiss croissant."
fifty fifty,3157 Geary Blvd,So good. Try the lavender Earl Grey latte. Buy the coffee beans - all light roast!!
