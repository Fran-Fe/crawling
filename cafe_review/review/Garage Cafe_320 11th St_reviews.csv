Garage Cafe,320 11th St,"Not open for the past couple weekends and weeks in between - everyone that populates 11th street miss our guy so much!!  He is a pillar of stability that supports the action taking place on the “Club Corridor”.  We’re all hoping he returns soon and in good health.  Joe is a treasure on 11th.  Every day I look to see if he’s opened back up - it’s been a rare day to see this place not taking business.  Truly, you never know watcha got til it’s gone 😥  We all hope to see you soon, and are sending the best wishes and loves and positive vibes. 🥰💜💝"

Will definitely be coming back.
