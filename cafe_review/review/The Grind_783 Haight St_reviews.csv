The Grind,783 Haight St,"I ordered coffee, toast, and eggs, and the staff was friendly and pleasant. The staff recommended the sausage, which was spicy and very tasty!"
The Grind,783 Haight St,Eat here often.  It's good but SO SLOW regardless of how busy.  It takes about 30 minutes to get a salad.  Order ahead
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Nice place, great food, though you have to bus your own table."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"A dope gentleman greeted us and was so sweet. Our Chinese chicken salad came out in literally minutes. Lettuce wrapped burger took just a couple minutes more, so super quick overall. The staff were so sweet and the interior is spacious as hell. Glad I found this place!  *eta: damn the food is delicious, too!"
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I love their veggie omelette with feta cheese instead of cheddar and a side of home fries and an onion or garlic bagel. Their drip coffee is delicious, I like to add half & half and sprinkle some cinnamon powder."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Awesome spot for a casual meal. Order at the counter, food came right out. Super friendly service. Wi-Fi available"
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Like many others have said, the food here is great! Quite a bit overpriced but overall pretty tasty. They do mess up the occasional order but what warrants the one-star rating instead of a 4 star, is the wait staff, namely the older white lady at the front. The rest of the staff is friendly and great but she is discriminatory and downright rude.  For the white couple ahead of us, she gave them ranch and extra items for free, but for me and my ethnic girlfriend, we had to pay for all these things. When we went to grab the ketchup, she said those are for dine-in only and told us that we had to grab the ketchup packets for to-go even though the other ones are also clearly grab and go. We asked for a cup of water, and she said that we can't have any, and explicitly marked ""No drinks"" only on our bag. She proceeded to glare at us as we walked out.  I opened my food and there was a single piece of bacon on top of my veggie sandwich! This is absolutely unacceptable as bacon/pork is considered taboo in many religions/lifestyles including mine and they should be extra careful especially when someone orders a veggie sandwich. Though as seen in the photo, the placement looks almost deliberate which makes me even more suspicious of potential discrimination/retaliatory behavior.  I thought this would be an isolated incident so I gave them another shot today, and I was treated the exact same way by this employee if not more aggressive as if she recognized me. This cafe has a potential to become a local favorite and comfort food place of mine, but as long as the restaurant continues to keep employees who don't appreciate SF's diversity and treat customers so poorly, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. I also encourage others to not support such businesses that tolerate a culture of discrimination and hate."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I often go here with my friends on our lunch break. The stuff is pretty good, but expensive for its quality. Expensive even as a native San Franciscan"
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I visited this place on a daily basis during my staying around the area and I loved it from minute one. Apart from the delicious food and great coffee, its staff is the highlight without any doubts: they always welcomed me with a nice smile and courtesy.  Thank you guys for making every start of my days so amazing! Will have to visit you again!"
The Grind,783 Haight St,Had the pancake with Walnut and banana as well as the croissant french toast style with strawberries. Friendly but busy environment with a nice sitting area outside. Coffee is mediocre but food portions are large and well prepared. Recommended for a non fancy brunch with friends.
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I really wanted to support this business, but my food was delivered COLD. I know it was not the delivery driver’s fault; since I scheduled the order in advance, the restaurant probably had it sitting around for a long time. Not good. And they didn’t provide utensils. How do you eat hash browns without utensils? I hope they do better next time, if I give them a second chance."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I LOVE this place. The food is amazing, the people are incredibly nice, the tables are big and convenient, it's just wonderful in every possible way. It's not exactly cheap, but it's not bad value. I go every time I'm in the area."
The Grind,783 Haight St,Fast Casual breakfast with lots of options for gluten free or vegans.  Service is fast and efficient.
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Excellent cafe with a large, delicious, and healthy menu. The staff are friendly and I always try to stop by here when I'm in town for their oriental chicken salad."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Good coffee, good pancakes and good bagels. Simply said, the best breakfast in Lower Haight."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"The Rubin was on par with the best I ever had. Perfect bread, cheese and meat with just the right amount of dressing. 10/10"
The Grind,783 Haight St,i came here last year in july while on vacation. stayed 3 days in san francisco and went 2 out of the 3. the food that was served to me has never tasted so good. every bite i took was absolutely delicious. the mango smoothie tasted like they specifically picked that mango for me. i have thought about this restaurant for so long. i wish to return one day and cherish it for the time i stay. i love the grind
The Grind,783 Haight St,"It's a great spot! The hash browns were kinda ho-hum but my southwest omelette was delicious and they substituted my toast for an everything bagel at no extra cost. Coffee was good too. The staff were all friendly and competent, the place was clean, everyone was masked up, and the outdoor seating was comfy. Oh and I was super happy that there wasn't even a line at 10am on a Saturday."
The Grind,783 Haight St,Best breakfast scrambles around.
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Food is tasty but sandwich took over 30 minutes to prepare, wouldnt recommend overall"
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I usually go here about once a week due to its proximity to our apartment. I enjoy the coffee and their parklet is great! I find the food pretty good, need to toast their bagels a bit more. However, when this place gets busy, it gets BUSY! It can take a moment to get your food. Please be kind and respectful to the staff!"
The Grind,783 Haight St,"We ordered breakfast from here on UberEATS. We got a waffle with Nutella and bananas, a side of hash browns, and a haight scramble with home fries and toast. The food tasted great and the portions were good size and even with it getting delivered nothing was soggy. The hash browns and home fries were still crunchy. Everything was packed nicely. I will definitely order from here again."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Loved our breakfast, appreciate the cooks, everything was delicious and we could tell made to order. Ladies in front friendly and quick. Even the busses was quick and friendly. Made our Sunday trip set off on a great start!!!!"
The Grind,783 Haight St,Food was good and they had a cool set with ordering and stuff. No complaints with the service either.
The Grind,783 Haight St,"great breakfast brunch stop, order any one of their amazing dishes and it's delivered to your table in a short time, just in time to fill the belly. I've only had breakfast here but it's always a pleasure"
The Grind,783 Haight St,The best in comfort food!  And the service is superb!
The Grind,783 Haight St,"I eat here about once a week for brunch. It's pretty easy to get a table and I very much enjoy their menu. It has a good mix of fresh salads and sandwiches as well as brunch favorites.  Their coffee drinks are made quick to order and are delicious. I'll often order a latte along with a bagel or something else similarly light. However, I've not been disappointed with an order yet."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"One of the best cafes in San Francisco! Hands down the best chicken fried steak I have ever had! I have tried most of the menu and love everything on it. The only thing I don't like that I have tried are the country home potatoes, not sure what it is about them, I just didn't like them."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Great place for a quick brunch. The menu is pretty far reaching and well rounded. Not the fanciest place but great if you need a quick, delicious brunch! There’s something for everyone"
The Grind,783 Haight St,The service from the staff was very good and they were very friendly. The food came out quick and tasted excellent. The atmosphere was your typical burger joint atmosphere.
The Grind,783 Haight St,I ordered the mushroom Swiss hamburger I found it to be tasteless and very greasy.. very disappointed. I have eaten here from many years it seems like the quality is falling off.. also that burger was $17.. with union rings... McDonald's would have been better.
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Lovely Pancakes, nice service and really fast! My recommendation: the walnut banana pancakes 🍌 …"
The Grind,783 Haight St,Went there from out of town and not familiar with the menu. Had the idea of ordering pancakes with eggs and 2 slices of bacon and my daughter wanted waffles with eggs and 2 bacon slices. Somehow the heavy set lady at the cash register gave us everything as side orders in addition to 4 separate orders of bacon even though this place offers combos which is basically what we wanted. When I asked her how come she didn't suggest a combo or why she gave us so much bacon she stated very loudly that it wasn't her job to tell customers what to order. We did not question the $35 per breakfast because we thought SF was expensive. Do not expect any help from these people. Will never go back even though the coffee is good.
The Grind,783 Haight St,"MANDATORY GRATUITY is incongruous terminology. Though the food is still good, these people embarrassed me by charging me a 15% mandatory gratuity without telling me. I would have refused to pay and walked out, but I did not want to embarrass my guest. They have no waiter to provide service. If employees are underpaid either the employer needs to pay a living wage or the employees need to look for work elsewhere. A gratuity, by definition, cannot be mandated. The patron may choose to leave nothing or a massive tip, but that is the patrons choice. I will never eat here again. I will ask every restaurant their gratuity policy before I order. I will not provide compensation for a cheap, heartless, lying employers greed."
The Grind,783 Haight St,"Terrible customer service. The barrister was very unprofessional. I am a writer who likes to get a coffee and some snacks when I sit down at a place for a few hours. This rather heavy-set employee began harassing me when she saw I had ordered only a coffee and a piece of cake. I asked her ""Is this considered food so I sit down?"" She answered yes. But when I was eating the food she had approved as ""food,"" she returned to me, telling me I had to be ""consuming food"" to which I said ""Is there a rule how fast should I be eating my food?"" because I did have my slice of cake in front of me. Awful customer service. I was going to give them three stars for good food but if you are treated poorly, the food won't taste good.  The server then started yelling at her own adolescent daughter in front of the customers."
The Grind,783 Haight St,Every time I've been in it's a great experience. The staff are super nice and friendly. I'm always able to use the bathroom which is super nice when bike commuting around the city. A go-to spot for my mom and I now.
The Grind,783 Haight St,Great little place. Clean and fast service. Walking distance to painted ladies (FYI up hill).
The Grind,783 Haight St,Food was delicious. Loved the hot chocolate as well.
The Grind,783 Haight St,The best cookies! The peanut butter and ginger ones really make my day
The Grind,783 Haight St,Absolutely killer breakfast burritos. Hash browns were pretty good as well. The servers were all wonderful.
