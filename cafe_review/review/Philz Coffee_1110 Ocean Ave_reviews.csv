Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Ordered a Jacobs Wonderbar, sweet and creamy, on the Philz app. Coffee was good. I like the decorations and coffee memes at this Philz."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Real coffee, real people.  It’s a vibe they hold strong too… For a long time I’ve enjoyed their coffee and shops through out the bay.  Today I ordered via the mobile app. But I ordered pick up at the wrong Philz 50 miles away… at 630 am, in the most pleasant of ways, the baristas at store I was actually at heard my sad story and made my order.  Thank you for helping me have a good morning .  And thank you for the beautiful mint mojito"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"The worst Philz experience I have ever had. The place is a dump. Mobile ordering only, the bathroom smells of urine, music is distasteful and everything from floors to tables are disgusting. I ordered a croissant that was stale when I took a corner off, I went up to ask if they could heat it up and they said they couldn't because I had taken a bite off. Huge fan of Philz generally, this is the worst one... EVER."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Right off the City College of San Francisco. The place has a great atmosphere with many students and passerby grabbing a drink. A pretty good selection of coffee. If you want to study with a drink this a a spot to definitely check out. The staff definitely made the drinks in a timely manner.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Killer coffee. Probably the best anywhere. The team preparing it are like scientists in a lab. Be patient, they are working on your own loving custom made cup of fragrant coffee beans being treated the proper way! Behold the miracle, then hold and drink and savor it!"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"This is not how you serve a cold brew coffee  Also, why $6.15 for a reguler medium black simple cold brew??"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Wonderfully delicious coffee and friendly baristas. Definitely a treat to visit here when I get the chance. Very accessible from public transportation, street parking is a little iffy since this section of Ocean Avenue is always typically busy. Usually a little bit of wait since the coffee is individually made, but not a big deal since it's incredibly worth it. For dark roasts, definitely try out the Jacob's Wonderbar and for medium roasts I'm quite partial to the Tesora. Be on the lookout for some of their featured creations like their Iced Mint Mojito too."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Great Coffee place to go too. Plum muffin was awesome too. Great service and excellent coffee taste.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,i LOVEEE philz coffee. absolutely exquisite coffee and affable staff. the calming environment allows for a tasteful place to enjoy fresh brews.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Good old Philz Coffee. No complaints here. Got my coffee on time, vibe was good."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"I have come here multiple times and It simply okay. I like the vibe and it is a great study area. However, I am not a big fan of the coffee of food. I ordered an egg and pork sausage burrito which is $6.50. The tortilla was hard and the quality poor. I also tried their hazelnut coffee and it had no flavor."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,The coffee was really good. Everything is ground to order. We tried the mojito and the iced mocha and they were super fresh and flavorful.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"The philz mint mojito is my favorite drink! A bit pricey, but very worth it on those tiring mornings."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,I waited 15+ minutes for a Small cold brew that costs $5. The line was short and they were fully staffed. coffee has amazing flavor but Overpriced. Update - I tried moving to phone order for more accurate pickup - even the phone orders are 15+ minutes late. What a joke! I am done with this business.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Fantastic as always but short staffed. Really appreciated the two women working the whole place solo as this is a very busy location.  Would be 5 but have to ding one star for owners not ensuring staffing is right.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Love this place, never have had a people problem for the past 5years I’ve been coming here.  Today I was clearly 45mins past close time (5.45pm) to pick up packed ground coffee beans, and I would have been OK with “we are closed”, “whatever it is pick up tomorrow, cause we are closed”.. instead someone did open the door and literally told me “NEXT TIME, COME ON TIME, OR WE WILL THROW IT AWAY”.  I’m not sure this qualifies as a response for any reason. Keep the door shut if you don’t want to deal with a late one like me and I will walk away disappointed at myself - not you!  Absolutely unnecessary to treat anyone this way."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Nicole was very helpful picking out the drink I wanted. Great spot.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"It really depends what your needs are. If you enjoy coffee that makes the day more productive speed wise with solid wifi, then this place suits your needs."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Next to the City College main campus, it's spacious and offers different types is seating. Many flavors and roasts to choose from. Cool little tables inside and outside to share a nice conversation over."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"My cat liked the coffee so much he stole it from me, will have to order 2 in future"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Wait times have gone to standard 15-30 minutes even ordering online. Slow service, the vibe has gone.  Poor communication between staff. One Cashier taking orders, making food. C'mon Philz!  Get the spark back into this place!!"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"If you are a coffee lover you must at least try coffee here once. Clean, spacious, fun interior. Trendy crowd. Cheerful and friendly staff. The place is usually full; be patient if you are looking for a spot at the table and would like to work on your laptop. The coffee is pricey but you can't get this kind of coffee elsewhere. If in doubt, try the iced half-sweet phiharmonic."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Philz is always great, the only complaints I have here is parking. Other than that everything is great"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Great place to study. There are always plenty of seats at the community tables. Plus plenty of outlets to charge your laptop and/or phone. Then when you need a break or meal there are other places for a change scenery. Then come back for a second coffee and round 2 of studying. It's Philz. Great coffe!
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Your typical Philz San Francisco experience. The signs are clear for first timers. Suggest taking a minute to decide your drink and how you'd like it (no milk, with milk and sugar, Philz way etc) before going up to the counter. Also all coffees are hand crafted, so can take an extra minute - but so worth it. They also have an app that you can use to order in advance."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Great place, awesome atmosphere, and the peeps that work here are so cool and friendly! I don't drink coffee, but their hot chocolate is phenomenal, and they're teas are pretty fine. Overall it's a really cashmoney place🤙🤙🤙 …"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Love the Philz brand having been in Berkeley during college. Great addition to the Ocean Avenue area. Large with a fair amount of seating and power outlets. Never been too crazy busy when I've stopped by. Had a strange smoggy, smokey haze inside once however would've interested to know if others have had this happen."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,One of the best ones yet. They are friendly and their coffees are a must. You can customize your drink to one of 3 sweet levels. That's great for those who are picky.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Phil'z has been my favorite coffee place in San Francisco since I moved here, and now I have one around the corner from my apartment! This location is the best yet. Awesome if you like board games as well - they have a big variety available to play and plenty of roomy tables."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Cute spot, good coffee, but ordering ahead of time they made me wait 40 min for a cup of coffee (while the baristas are just sitting there chatting). I don't know about you but when I order a cup of coffee I don't expect to wait 40 min"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Got my order wrong again, I don't know why this keeps happening, I cant read the font its too small and its the second time they've pointed me to the wrong drink."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Dark roast iced coffee is my reason for going to Philz Coffee. It has a smooth flavor and. Strong caffeinated beverage are offered. The food choices are great too. Servers are often ecentic and unique.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Love my Philz Coffee. Every time I come here I always get an awesome cup of coffee ☕️. The service is always great and make sure that I sip and completely satisfied. I love the environment and it’s very easy to work here with having WiFi access. I try to always go to locations I haven’t been into just to try out the different food. I do miss Philz’s on Virgin America flights.  Note: my favorites are always Estatic, Mint Mohito and Philz’s Ice Tea."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Friendly baristas and great coffee. What more could you want? My husband and I are obsessed with Philz coffee!
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"The coffee was great but I can't seem to get the right combination when it comes to 'light sugar and light cream.'  Usually too creamy or too sugary, this time was too creamy and not enough sugar."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,I love Philz! But this location specificly has a really friendly staff great set up. It does get a little crowded since it's right by city college and there are a ton of students always studying.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Great, make sure you buy the homeless people outside a cup or give them your change. Oh wait a minute im thinking of the one in the Tenderloin....the one on Ocean its great too. Make sure you buy the homeless person outside a coffee or give him your change."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"This is a review for philz in general. I've only been to 2 locations but my experience was very much the same. This is where I had my first Philz and I must say I felt a bit overwhelmed because all their coffees have special names and it's hard to choose! However, Their coffee experts are very knowledgeable and willing to help you find your perfect cup!  I got the Jacobs wonderbar as the barista recommendation and she got it 100% right.  Best coffee I've had in the US! I loved the flavor ~ with hints of dark chocolate, smoke, and nuts (not smoke from cigars, the meaty smoke I'd assume, but actually didn't taste it so much). All I said was that I liked Lattes that were creamy~ I've also tried the tesora  (with caramel nuts and butter hints) but still prefer Jacobs and continue to order this one.  They have some real special coffees but I'm conservative so will probably stick to my own, if you want something different, how about trying the mint bonito iced coffee? Looks very Pretty!  Cafe has many chairs and tables but it's usually pretty full, CCSF is right next to it!"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"A-last after coming here, since it opened the store has degraded in customer service. Ex: Their ac is broken. They open both doors. The customers put coats on and shut the door. Staff opens the door. They are asked why. Staff confirms it is for the comfort of the staff, not the customer. Value is derived from demands of customers."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,The staff are really friendly and nice atmosphere except the music is way too loud! And they often have really stressful/annoying music playing that makes it difficult to stay. Sounds more like a club than a coffee shop.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Saw Philz on my way to work, dropped in for a cup of coffee, ask for a small, medium roast, walked out the store with coffee in hand, took a sip, and hated it! Straight mud. There's no goin' back there."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Busy place,  plenty of seats. Order ahead and save yourself a 10 minute wait.Parking is tough."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Love Philz but love this location in particular. It's near City College so it does have a regular flow of college kids and young professionals. The music is always vibin' between top 40's and 2000's throwbacks. The decor is modern yet laid back with couches and communal tables. Floor to ceiling windows provide lots of natural light. The baristas here have fun and are often signing behind the counter. Great coffee, tea, small eats like avocado toast (which is one of my faves any where - there's has za'atar seasoning on it), and non dairy options."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Really poor coffee. Gave me the exact opposite of what I asked for. Took three sips then handed it back to dump down the sink. I'd already paid for it and they offered no compensation. Absolutely avoid.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,I've wanted to love Philz since it's such an institution in San Francisco and that's the only reason I've contributed to give them a shot but honestly their coffee is worse than Starbucks and there was a mistake with my order on all three of my visits.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Philz is the worst coffee place ever. The coffee sucks. It’s way overpriced. You can’t add your own milk, sugar, etc. They have to control the amount of milk you add. The counter person says “how much more milk do you want?” And I’m supposed to say what, “5 drops, thanks”?? Bunch of techie bs"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Nice Philz with some good seating. Not quite as cozy feeling as the Noe location - it has a bit of that concrete industrial chic thing going on that's popular right now. Seems frequented by City College students and police officers.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"You have to go, if you like coffee this is a must, ive been getting each item on the menu, almost done! I ask for no cream or sugar, to get the real taste of their coffee wich again is really good"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Friendly baristas and great coffee! There is also some good sitting both inside and out. Always get a large philharmonic with cinnamon in the filter, consistently goood."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Great place to study, wide variety of coffee choices. I wouldn’t advise getting food here - mainly just side dishes and are expensive. However there are lots of places around that you can go to for that."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,They did not tell me there were going to be mint leaves in my coffee so I freaked out on the freeway with a leaf sticking out of my coffee. Coffee was burnt anyway.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"Last time I went I spent like 100 bucks on coffee and I regretted nothing because it is the best coffee on Earth, this location is perfect and just what Ocean ave needed, imo! Forever loving Philz!"
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,"lotsa couches & seating indoor and out. baristas are super sweet, shout out to kg. despite the number of seats, this place can get swamped sometimes with city college nearby."
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,The extra-extra-extra sweet iced mojito does something to me that I just can't resist it. It's so delicious. I just wish it wasn't the only drink at Philz that caused that emotion.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,It was ok. I love hot cocoa but i can never find a good one like starbucks. The cinnamon roll was a plus
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Love this cozy coffee shop. The Cashier is so nice.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Nice coffee place. Sometimes it gets really really busy.
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Top notch cup of coffee! I like the free wifi 🤠 …
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,Philz is the best coffee also if u bring in your personal mug. Theyll charge u for a small. They always aim for perfection
Philz Coffee,1110 Ocean Ave,I don't understand why people love Philz so much. It's usually burned and improperly prepared. Okay better than Starbucks but people mix up burned with strong.
