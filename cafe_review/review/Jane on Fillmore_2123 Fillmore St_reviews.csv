Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,I’ve visited SF many times now and one things I always try to make sure of is to visit Jane at least once on every trip. This was the first time I dined in and I had truly an incredible experience.  The latte and avocado toast were amazing and the service was fantastic. 20/10 recommend supporting this establishment!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The pastries are incredible and the service is fast and efficient. The salmon and avocado toast where also really nice, great for a quick breakfast!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great cappuccino (no coconut milk, fyi). The people are decidedly unfriendly. The woman who took my order literally scowled at me the whole time even when I was super upbeat. I don’t expect the hype squad, but no one wants surly people to start your day. The $16 warm quinoa bowl is huge and healthy, but panning in flavor. Just plain ingredients. If you only want filling volume, it fits the bill, but def needs a sauce, more dressing."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Unfortunately the quality of food has been decreased, constantly the peanut butter taost is not toasted at all. I asked specifically for a well toasted toast but its still dry. Extremely thin layer of butter that I had to ask for extra butter on the side. May be they changed the chef or something but it's not the same taste and quality as it used to be. 6 months ago when I gave 5 stars: My regular place to go to. Yummy food, coffee. Amazing staff. Love this place. The fig toast and baked egg is a must try"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"thank you so much to this place! being gluten free in SF with so many delicious gluten filled items can be depressing, and finding this gem on a hungry saturday morning out was a blessing. excellent vibes, nice staff, and deliciously accommodating menu <3"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I stopped here a couple of time for lunch. I love their egg sandwich with the tomato chutney. Coffee is good. Some more smiles from the staff would do, though."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Everything so GOOD!! Espicially the espresso and blackberry cream cheese. This location has a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, so you could have sometime enjoy your breakfast! (limited for 45 mins but that's perfect for us)"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,First time to this popular bakery. We had a salad and egg sandwich. Both tasty and fresh. The brioche was the best part. I’d stick with pastries. Nice seating outside on Fillmore.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great spot for a working or personal lunch/coffee. Captain crunch cookie is the best
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Me and my friend came here to get a quick bite, the sandwich was decent but the juice had completely settled and already separated when I got it. The service on the other hand… the girl at the register was so rude and cold. No smile, no warmth, made me feel very unwelcomed and honestly I won’t be back because of that."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Chicken salad + white egg panini are good!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"This place is popular because it's popular, know what I mean?  I got the spiced eggs and shawarma bowl. Food tastes like a meal I throw would together from leftovers -- not bad, but not good. Matcha and chai were watered down, made from syrup maybe."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Quick and efficient service here, I got the coffee cake which was quite nice. The crust is a bit crunchy which is definitely enjoyable and it’s not overwhelmingly sweet.  The coffee is a bit watered down for my liking, I expect cold brew to be a bit stronger.  They do have an outdoor seating area open so it’s a nice place to Chill and just read or talk to a friend. Come out and support local business!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Went to Jane this morning based on their high reviews. We arrived at 6:55..minutes before opening at 7am.The outside of the cafe was pretty grungy (although staff was trying to clean a bit). The entry way was wet from what looked like garage being brought out through the restaurant. The tables were covered with crumbs and so were some of the seats. I got Avocado Mash, the dish looked great, but tasted okay. The avocado mash tasted like premade guacamole you buy at any supermarket. I asked the staff if they make the avocado mash in house: they said halfway..I'm not sure how to make mashed avocado halfway..but it's definitely not worth $9."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Chaotic counter service.  Pedestrian - even boring - menu.  Very limited seating so better for take out perhaps, except then you have to get home before you discover your food is meh.  I feel bad for the folks in the neighborhood who are stuck with this place, there are so many amazing and fun venues in SF.  Maybe my expectations were too high after having heard good things, but probably not even worth a second chance unless you like oatmeal, which was adequate.  Worst quiche I've ever eaten - it was gummy and served reheated but lukewarm."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"such a cool atmosphere with amazing food!! i got the egg white panini and it was to DIE for!! the bread is so incredible, as someone coming from out of state, the bread truly cannot be topped! i also had their homemade chai with oatmilk and it was FANTASTIC!! i love my chai spicy so it was great :) service is kind as well and helpful. thanks again"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Prepare yourself for a LONG line! If I wasn't a tourist I'd never wait 25 minutes for coffee. However, it's a nice atmosphere, young crowd, good coffee, fresh food... so I definitely enjoyed myself."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Food is great but service is the WORST. Recommend going to Jane Bakery instead. Yes the line may be longer but trust me, you will get your order sooner and people are nicer."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Coffee was good. The sandwiches were decent, the club sandwich had really nice candied bacon and the mango chicken salad sandwich was really flavorful."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Really chill atmosphere! However, I wasn’t very impressed with the salad. It has a great base but poor execution, it lacked flavor and needed even just a bit of lemon. I keep adding salad, very bland."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Always great that the locals can lead you to a place with great adaptations of standard breakfast and lunch fare, as well as unique bakery treats. Definitely a highlight on your walk along Filmore."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I've googled avocado breakfast in San Francisco, Jane on Fillmore  came out from our search. We've decided to head to this cafe for breakfast. There was a consistent queue  in Jane. We've ordered 2 coffee and an avocado toast also a dragon fruit smoothie bowl. This is my first smoothie bowl. It was very fresh, we also had the avocado toast it was very good as well. Best healthy breakfast place to go to in San Francisco."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"So surprised there wasn't a live. I was able to grab a table quite easily. Service was fine. Food and drinks were good, a little pricy but I would go again. The savory oatmeal with kimchi was good. The matcha latte was a little light on flavor."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I went here yesterday after getting some bras at Knix , the nice barista named Tatum made me an amazing charcoal latte and smoked salmon toast , this place is a non vaccine 💉 freedom choice restaurant so I wanted to support and definitely will be back! Thank you for giving your customers their god given freedoms and not being corrosion based. Thanks again Tatum!!!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Yummy coffee. Egg sandwich was giant. Free wifi. Nice ambiance. It does tend to get crowded though at peak lunch hr and peak breakfast hr. If you want yummy pastries but less wait I'd suggest Jane the bakery on Geary. Had their spicy egg breakfast and savory oats and quinoa warm bowl. The quinoa warm bowl was a definite winner.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Greet brunch/lunch spot. The sandwiches are really good as is the coffee. Not a lot of seating inside but you can always take your food to Alta Plaza park and eat it while you enjoy nice SF vistas
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Loud pop music make this place not suitable for lunch with people. If you into Demi Lovato, just use headphones. Not everyone into it.  Avocado mash looks like someone was eating it before me, lmao."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Staff was super friendly when taking my order and ringing me up and while I waited for my yummy mocha latte. Their wallpaper was perfect photo backdrop during the wait and the banana bread was super delicious as well
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Prefer the takeout at the bakery, but if you can find a spot outside or upstairs you can relax with your pastry."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Several gluten free options. The chia parfait is perfection. Hearty toast with toppings make a meal. Yes, waiting in line is worth it."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great coffee delicious food and friendly smiling staff. This place is very busy in the weekends, bit also during the week so don't expect a quite little cafe. It would be great if they switched out some of the metal chairs upstairs with some comfy armchairs, at the moment it is just hard metal chairs I guess to fit in more people."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,One of the best cafe/bakery in town. Always pretty crowded. Upstairs is a good workplace. Cookies and sandwiches are Top
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"It's not a bakery, Google should change that to coffee shop. They do bake all their own goods but they are baked at other locations and there's a good selection but not like a full on bakery.  Clientele is 90% wealthy 45 yo+ pac heights white ladies, I'm not mad at it. The food menu is healthier fare, I would say it's not a huge menu but you can definitely have a meal here. The breakfast salad is a unique option.  Staff is perfect mix of sweet and surly that is the mark of good coffee."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Always good food, very good quality  espresso and the stuff is absolutely friendly. Seems like they really enjoy being there. My favorites are: 1) cauliflower sandwich 2)pastry with earl gray cream 3) brioche with raspberry 4) chicken pot pie 5) mushroom tart"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Mediocre overpriced food, very slow kitchen, unresponsive staff at the counter. Waited for 50min for a cold tasteless egg sandwich. Our order was put behind others that came much later and came in stages 10 min apart even though all sandwiches where exactly the same kind. We ordered a dragon fruit bowl but when it was brought to the table it looked more like soup. Horrible experience, worst place I've been in a very long time."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Went in on a Thursday afternoon for a coffee and some cookies to go. Saw a handful of people working and a few others just relaxing. The staff was friendly and helpful. 👍 It's a nice little place with small entrees, good pastries and coffee. If you go for the pastries, plan to be there early as they run out of items later on in the day."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good bread, but they are giving 50% of their proceeds to abortions for the month of July, so one star."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Excellent breakfast sandwich. Maybe a little expensive at $12 but it was delicious. It was very clean inside and the staff was nice.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good coffee and pastry...GF Banana bread (so so), Cheddar and Chive biscuit ( very good)...mocha, drip coffee and charcoal latte...all very god"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Their egg white panini is one of the best deals in town.  Big and delicious!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,My frisee salad was delicious but my sisters avocado toast was actually guacamole on toast which sounds the same but it's really not.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Avocado toast was cold - not room temperature, actually cold. Egg salad sandwich is very bland. Spicy baked eggs is weirdly watery. The latte is good."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Excellent food and service. Don’t be discouraged by the line. It’s worth the wait!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Yummy coffee and a nice selection of pastries, presumably from their larger (and more extensive) bakery on Geary. It would be great if they carried a slightly larger variety of pastries at the Jane on Fillmore, but it's still very good."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"If you're expecting a decent latte and croissant,l  in SF I wouldn't highly recommend this place.  Everyone is drinking bottle of water or orange juice and eating some salad."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I waited over 30 minutes for one oatmeal that would not have taken 5 minutes to make. And then I asked them to check in my order, I still did not get it.  Then I asked another server who then brought it to me."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The biscuit and bread are great! Lot of healthy options.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Delicious, one of the best places to eat in San Francisco. Note: it’s crowded, so, try to be early and with time / patient. It would be worth it."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I recently ate at Jane on Fillmore. The location is easily accessible and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the acai bowl, packed with delicious seeds and fruits. The only drawback is that it is overpriced for the food that the offer."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Amazing food and atmosphere! Bottomless drip coffees! Must go!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,I love it here. It’s one of my must stops when I’m walking Fillmore with my doggy. I can’t even think of their cookies without want to go and get one. I also adore their breakfast. Always something new to try and the staff is so friendly and kind. I also really proud to support local businesses with women entrepreneurs like this one so it’s a win-win situation for me: taste good and feel good.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Very busy at ten in the morning Saturday. Inside and outside seating. Large selection of non-traditional breakfast entrees. Avocado toast must be a SF thing. It looked good. We'd come back.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Only good staff, that's all.  The food is bad from the word at all.  Sandwich as from a pack."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The eggs here are microwaved, or taste as if they have been microwaved, which is problematic when they charge like 13 bucks for an egg dish. I mean expect dry, overcooked, microwaved egg slabs at McDonalds or Burger King when they charge just a few bucks. But not at a nicer place like this. It makes no sense to serve food like this at this price point in this kind of place."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Very good food and they have lots of healthy options! The space is nice but maybe too small, it gets crowded and most of the time we don't get seats unless we wait at least 10 mins."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,You won't go wrong with avocado toast and ricotta toast
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great food and coffee but difficult to find a table on Saturday morning.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Hot chocolate tasted very odd, had some kind of “zest” or spice but wasn’t Mexican hot chocolate. Stools are small and uncomfortable, and the quinoa kale bowl was bland and soggy."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Purchased Jane's delicious and always rewarding sourdough and two tasty  croissants, and then I thought I would try out their $12.00 roast beef  sandwich. Seemed like a good idea. Pricey yes, but heck, this is Jane on Fillmore. What a disappointment  More than a disappointment it was a rip.  Why do this Jane?  You have to gouge your customers for two pieces of bread, and three thinly sliced pieces of roast beef that measured 5mm at its thickest and which was clearly not a uniform measurement of roast beet throughout the sandwich because the 5mm of meet was piled up in the middle or the sandwich, cut in half for display. The sandwich itself was 4 inches at its widest and tapered back from there. On top of all this, the sandwich was tasteless. What gives Jane?  You have to squeeze that extra thousand percent profit out of a sandwich at the expense of your well earned reputation for great breads and baked goods. Who's in charge of sandwiches? He/she needs a talking to."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Mocha took too long.   Came out after food.  The poached egg on my avacado mash was cold!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great place to have breakfast, also glutenfree options. Very frienddly staff!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The service was quick and the meal was great!  Wonderful biscuit with egg, cheese and turkey sausage!  Great place."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Sorry I was hungry, so took a few bites before the photo was taken. This place offers quick, fresh and tasty foods. Casual setting."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"A very pleasant cafe to get coffee and toasts, the staff are always friendly and polite. The food is overall good and you can hardly can have a bad experience with it. I would recommend to get their egg salad sandwich, it’s one the top items on their menu."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"This review is for Jane on Fillmore (NOT Jane the Bakery which I’ve had nothing but great experiences with).  Pastries/baked goods: 5/5. You’ll get them fresher at Jane the Bakery but they’re pretty much the closest you’ll get to real Parisian baked goods in SF  food: 2/5: it doesn’t taste very fresh and often under seasoned  Cleanliness: 2/5. On our most recent visit we both got horrible stomach issues after visiting. This is the second time I’ve had issues with this location. Looking at their health scores it’s not surprising (vermin infestations, etc.)  I haven’t had issues with Jane the Bakery so I’d suggest sticking with that location instead."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Jane was crowded for Sunday brunch, but the food was worth the wait. The Peru Bowl was a perfect blend of lettuce, brown rice, spicy chicken, cherry tomatoes  and diced cucumber, topped with sliced avocado.  The cheese biscuit was moist and cheesy, with a nice chewiness."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Nice shop in a great location. Their roast their coffee on the darker side, so if you like that it'll be perfect. I had the avocado mash and cappuccino, and both were fantastic.  Although the sour dough bread was a bit too thick for my liking, everything else about their interpretation of the avocado toast was excellent. It comes with an egg (I recommend getting it soft boiled), jalapenos, and onions. I would definitely order this dish again.  The staff is also very kind and helpful. Make sure to come early though, this place can get very crowded as it is very popular!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Bathrooms are continuously very dirty. Toilet bowl has been filthy every single time I’ve been there. The toilet clean-up sheet (displayed in the bathroom) shows that the last time the bathroom got cleaned was over 2 months ago 😧. This lack of hygiene is making me wonder about the other hygienic practice of this place… …
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I go here on an almost daily basis! Love the coffee, love the folks who work here. They have GF-friendly sweet options too! Place is very clean and has a well-organized approach to ordering/pick up, etc. My personal favorite is the iced americano!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"cute place and VERY popular. the staff was friendly and courteous.  confirmed with staff: no laptops and 45 minute limit to all indoor tables, upstairs and downstairs (not sure about outdoor seating but that doesn’t have any outlets)"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Really nice. Duct area but this place is great!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"We arrived and ordered at 9:30… we didn’t get our food until 10:50.  Stop prioritizing DoorDash orders over people who are sitting in your restaurant waiting for food. Worst of all, my eggs were ice cold after waiting for 90 minutes and my partners sandwich was straight from the microwave."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Everything is super good but my go-to is the egg white panini. I'm not sure if they make their own bread or source it from somewhere but it's amazingly fresh and incredible
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The place is nice, but avocado toast and coffee could be better. it looks pretty cool."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Lovely spot. Good quality food. Good service. Hard to find a table at times. Was very happy with what I ordered. Deviled egg sandwich was great. Tried my friends' salads as well. Cobb and Asian cabbage salads were very good. Great portions.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great cafe on Fillmore to get coffee, breakfast or lunch. They have a large salad menu, with lots of different options. The cookies are also delicious. There is often a long line, because your order at the counter and service isn’t particularly fast. If the overall service improved, this would easily be 5 stars given the quality and price of the food and drinks."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,What a nice cafe. Good coffee and great sandwiches. Everything was kind and had a very good quality.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great coffee, many food and pastry option in the menu. I love their smoothly bowls. The avocado mash is okay. The atmosphere is relax and friendly. People here are very nice."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Coffee was just great- the cups are also really pretty. I remember accidentally coming here both times I was waiting in line for a table at Brenda's. They serve charcoal lattes here in case you need a Sunday morning cleanse after a night out. Overall it's a great place to have lunch or brunch! (It was also very busy on a Friday afternoon when I took a day off from work to study for my licensing exam.)
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,It is very trendy here and it is almost always busy. Whether you're waiting for take out or waiting for a table you will be waiting for quite a while as despite the staff moving about at lightning speeds it is just really popular.  Is it worth the wait?  Yes. The food is delicious and the coffee is pretty great too. If you manage to snag a window seat it's a great place to people watch too.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Poor service; messed up my order; mediocre food
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Some friends brought me a box of goodies from Jane. Some kind of muffin shaped sweet croissant, 2 tarts, a chocolate croissant (the square-ish shaped kind, not the traditional kind), a few savory ones. I don't know what it is about American bakeries but everything was arguably overcooked and bland compared to actual French (or Japanese) bakeries. Sigh..."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"wide selection of food, drinks & pastries; great ambience"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Fantastic cafe! They do consistently excellent lattes and have great pastry options. The bread they bake is also delicious (try their walnut and fig loaf, for example). Given the quality, the place understandably gets super popular at peak times. Great ambiance, good mix of people hanging out chatting and others working."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I was very excited to try their pastries. I have heard very good things about their quality. The reason I'm giving two stars is due to staff. The server that provided me with my coffee was not in a pleasant mood, I asked where the sugar and milk was located & received a snarky remark as to it's location. When I received my avocado toast, it was just tossed on my table. I believe the staff would benefit from a customer service class."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Excellent food and excellent service! Two reasons it's not 5/5: the wait can be 40-60 minutes, and they also messed up an order and said they would refund it but it never went through. I ended up having to contest it with my credit card company due to their errors."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Delicious food and coffee. Friendly atmosphere and nice staff.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great coffee, they use Equator beans and Oatly (sometimes) 🙌  I'd give it a 5 if I could bring my laptop and work from here, but they don't allow for it. Will still go for a coffee to-go or for a coffee and a sit + chat. …"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Overrated, slow, and a total miss on the basics. Our lattes took 20 minutes even though there wasn’t a single person in line when we arrived. Both lattes were barely lukewarm because the barista poured each shot of espresso, then paused for a reeaally long involved conversation with a coworker, then steamed the milk for just a handful of seconds before pouring it. Definitely not worth $10.  We’d heard this spot is known for its baked goods but our pumpkin bread was super dry and disappointing — we actually saw another customer return her slice and ask for a different pastry because it was so dry.  Not sure what all the fuss is over this spot: seems like serving lattes that are actually hot and pastries that aren’t dry as sawdust shouldn’t be too tough of a bar to meet."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"While looking for a light salad place and a cup of tea on a late Sunday afternoon, my friend and I walked along  Fillmore, passing  empty fancy places until we stumbled into packed Jane. One glance at the menu and we knew we found it.  There were only two tiny seating spots left upstairs and those had a colorful view down into the bakery counter and the rest of the lively scene.  Lots of young people with their laptops, a good sign.  The Asian Chicken Salad with sesame dressing was super fresh and delicious and the service good and friendly.  Planning to come back."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Love this place.  Jane makes an amazing almond milk latte.  They also make a delicious espresso.  And, if you have a sweet tooth, their ""Crazy Cookie"" is really, really good.  The cinnamon rolls are just fabulous.  And, if you want to eat healthy, their granola and also their green smoothies are pretty darn good."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Only came here to get coffee. We got the detox and the turmeric latte. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the turmeric drink. I thought it was something new and it definitely tasted well. I loved the decorations with the lamps in the shapes of old hair salon hair dryers. There was quite a bit of wait even though there weren't that many people in the line.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this months ago, especially having dropped in at least three times by now! In any case, despite all the visits, I've only ever come in to try their pastries, and none of their hot foods. By now, I've had two of their coffee cakes, one of their regular cakes, one of their cookies, and most recently, their scones.  And, honestly? Not all that impressed. Good bakery items, but nothing phenomenal. Their coffee cakes are much tastier than their regular cakes, and their scones are pretty solid too, but you can also find better of the various individual items elsewhere in the city.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - Jane is a pretty compact venue, with some limited (but accessible) two tops up front, higher (and less accessible) bar height two tops towards the side, and a second floor with some other sort of seating. The ordering counter and the bar two tops end up forming a slightly narrow corridor, that's somewhat difficult to navigate when the place is packed (which is most of the time), but nothing a couple ""pardon me""s can't fix. As for ordering itself, I recall the counter being a tad on the high side, which makes it a little harder to see all the pastries they have on display.  Bathroom - No comment because I didn't try them."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Just wonderful. Asian chicken salad was plentiful, dragonfruit smoothie bowl was tasty and colorful, and the staff were just delightful. Plus they have a dazzling variety of pastries. Go early to avoid lines."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I absolutely love the atmosphere here! It has the feel of a modern, young, hip, coffee shop/ breakfast place.  My favorite is the egg sandwich which serves as the perfect quick meal or even breakfast on the go.  I often come here for a small bite, a cup of joe and to do about an hour of work and this place has all the angles covered.  I have also had the cinnamon roll here (I highly suggest that you ask them to heat up the roll, as it is 10x better that way).  This is my favorite breakfast place on Filmore for all the reason listed above in addition to the great staff!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"They make from scratch a somewhat yummy green smoothie (my favorite), serve four barrel coffee, have upstairs seating, and bar seating (so you can eat alone and enjoy your lunch without feeling lame). What’s to like?!: The vintage/art deco décor of the place. The soup & sandwich combos for $11. They make amazing soups and bake some incredible house made baked goods. I particularly love their cookies. To dislike?!: Not much to dislike here, only a lot to love."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Took them a full hour and 3 tries to make this sandwich without avocado... and they call it a panini...
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"They make the best mochas here! It’s unfortunately super crowded and it got worse over the past year. They have a few good vegan food options, specifically the smoothie bowls and the warm quinoa bowl. They also have salads if you’re into that. And they make some vegan cookies that are good, I wish they had more variety of those! I used to love their white chocolate chip cookie that has salt on it but that one’s not vegan. The workers are super friendly and always remember my order, even though they get so many customers!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I don't really understand the hype. I had a couple of their pastries and it was just okay. The place was packed (definitely not COVID compliant) and frankly it smelled kinda bad in there, which surprised me. Maybe it was the lack of air flow from having a ton of maskless people in there."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Amazing food. Great service and coffee. The granola and fruit is beautiful and the scrambled egg sandwich is amazing. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend.mend Jane's on Filmore.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Only tried the iced matcha latte with oat milk, but it was darn tasty! Decent place for meeting or working. Medium volume... Not too loud to hold a 1 on 1 conversation, but definitely not a quiet spot."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Delicious baked goods including gluten free options. Great coffee, lattes etc.very lovely staff. Food looked very good but did not try it today."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Food was good but wait was almost 30 minutes for our food. They obviously forgot our order and rushed out the food without a properly cooked egg (no runny yoke). It is also interesting that we had to wait in line again to get the cookies we ordered and they wouldn't bring it to us when we asked at our table.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I really like this place, they have an interesting selection of yummy pastries (i think the cookie we got was called the crazy cookie), and good coffee. Super crowded, though, and really no place to sit which is a bummer (barely space to even stand in line). The upstairs is also a bit hipstery with the graffiti.  But if you're in SF for something or are in the Fillmore, definitely worth a stop."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Both the coffee and the food are excellent if you're willing to brave the long line that's usually there. It can be difficult to hear what the person next to  you is saying, let alone hearing when your order is ready. Highly recommend ordering to go and hanging out at Alta park nearby to avoid the pretentious atmosphere."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Love Janes.  They have the best desserts and gluten free muffins with seasonal flavours.  I always get the pesto tomato sandwich/salad combo which is really good.  It is kinda pricey, but worth it."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Probably my favorite place to have a bite in Pacific Heights. Good prices and great food. Nothing fancy just delicious salads and sandwiches as well as great lattes. Always busy but people do move in and out quickly so you should be able to get a seat even though.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The coffee and food are good but nothing out of the ordinary. I wasn't dying to go back like I am with some cafes in San Francisco. I will say it is a fairly quick and convenient place to get a good cup of coffee on the go but sitting and eating is not ideal.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Coffee and menu is very decent. Glad I arrived at opening time because boy, does this place fill up fast. I like the variations of toast to choose from, the ricotta and walnut one was beautiful."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Fab! And delicious gluten free options available! Varies daily, but the gf banana bead and chocolate chip cookie are most excellent.  Not a TON of places to sit, but the bar is great whether with a friend to chat or by yourself.  Super friendly staff, the Golden Monkey tea is superb, and the atmosphere is lovely.  And best of all, it's not chain-brand Sbucks junk."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The Spicy Baked Eggs and Egg Sandwich were amazing. Great flavor, good sized portions and healthy selections. The bread alone is worth coming back for. Love the vibe and black and white decor too!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"This is a cute cafe that's nice to hang out in. It gets pretty busy on the weekend, but if you're just grabbing a to-go item, it's a great place to stop by. I love the Chai latte with soy milk and their selection of pastries. My favorite is the chocolate chip cookie and pound cake!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Terrible service, no seating. The food was decent but took 20 minutes of waiting in line and then there was no place to sit; they should make more of an effort to find dine-in patrons tables. When we found a table 35 minutes later, nobody came to wipe it down. Coffee was never delivered to table despite Barista saying it would be. Will not go back mostly because of awful logistics and inability to get seats."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"They're known for their baked goods, but they also make a mean Niçoise salad! Not a huge fan of their drip coffee but it does have free refills if you're a caffeine addict like me. Standing in line for a little bit is well worth the meal."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Constantly bustling with hip young professionals, Jane is a spectacular brunch and lunch place! The quinoa bread is remarkable and rather filling but not in a unhealthy way. I usually go with the egg sandwich though I wish there were more egg options that were not bread heavy. All in all, I would go back every weekend if I could. And the coffee is top notch too!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Panini was nicely done. The Dragon fruit bowl was a treat. Macchiato was nice and strong.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Nice little place with good looking food and coffee. However, the washroom is too close to the prep area for cold non cooked foods like granola and yogurt, salads etc.  You can smell the washroom from the coffee bar which is double the distance away. I got some type of stomach bug from here.  Bloated for 2 days, broke out in hives for over a week and now allergic to milk products.  I'm sure it's this place since my wife and 6 year old son ate and drank the same thing as I did for a week before and a week after.  The only thing they didn't eat was the from this place. The same day after eating from here I got sick."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,First visit to Jane on Fillmore and got avocado toast - one of the worst meals I’ve ever had. Left 3/4 of it on the plate. Ice cold guacamole paste on untoasted soggy bread and an ice cold hard boiled egg plopped on top. Nausea-inducing.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I like the bakery, but all of their egg dishes are bordering on terrible. I have never had stiffer eggs in my life. Get the bakery, get a coffee, I get a salad for sandwiches, but skip the eggs."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Coffee (specifically the cappuccino) is really good. The quality is good: temperature is right, nothing burnt. The service is meh. Pretty slow actually. Cookies were good and the biscuits were okay but probably better warm."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Amazing food!! Lots of health conscious options so it's totally safe for all people with all kinds of allergies. But no flavor is spared by using the healthy stuff. Great coffee great food great pastires !great service
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great coffee but there is always a long line.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Jane on filmore is on of san Francisco's best kept secrets. Service is second to none. What a great coffee shop. Can not wait until they get back to indoor service. Love the staff. Love the service. Love the product
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I hesitate to share this w/ you, for fear of them selling out after, but 100% try their Gluten Free Chocolate/Cherry cookie next time. It is UNREAL.  Amazing coffee and service too!!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Love the trendy, lively atmosphere here, and have always had positive experiences with both their drinks & food items. Can get a little crowded, and for whatever reason they have a rule that you can't use laptops at the tables near the front before 3pm."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Cockroaches! sadly our fav spot has declined significantly. we found cockroaches climbing on the water dispenser and on the counter where you can fix up your coffee. its nowhere near as clean or hygienic as it was years ago. the nice staff can't seem to keep up with the high traffic throughout the day to clean up sufficiently.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Very good coffee and pastries and sandwiches are good. A lot of healthy options on the menu. Too bad its self service and if you will buy more items than a simple drink, don't expect them to land on your table all at the same time."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"When you first glance inside the lovely windows and doors of Jane on Fillmore, you're met with some pleasant decor and a bustling vibe full of many guests dining away, an impressive 1st impression that unfortunately ends as soon as you walk through the doors.  Right upon entry, this wave of heat straight out of the sahara desert engulfs every inch of your body, making you feel like a young high school wrestler trapped inside of a steaming hot sauna trying to cut weight for a competition tomorrow.  After peeling off every acceptable layer of clothing possible and navigating my order through heat stroke like conditions (Me - Turkey Club Sandwhich; My GF - Avocado Mash), I eagerly awaited the reprieve I would feel once I finally received the delicious brunch food that I was promised through the many positive reviews online.  Unfortunately, my saga did not contain the Cinderella ending that I so desperately hoped for.  While waiting for my food to be finished, I couldn't help but watch all the hard working chefs bustling meticulously away while preparing every dish inside of their open kitchen next to the dining area.  My curiosity indeed killed the cat (or in this case my appetite), watching them create a standard avocado toast consisted of them pulling out a large industrial sized tub of guac that looked like it was purchased from costco, slathering an ungodly amount onto multiple pieces of toast, followed by pre-made already peeled hard boiled eggs also from a tub.  It felt like if McDonald's ever served avocado toast, this would be the conveyor belt method that they would enforce, hardly the expected amount of personalization or individually cut avocado from actual avocados that a $9  price tag should warrant.  Our fears were confirmed when we actually started consuming our food. The egg and guac mash were indeed cold and bland as expected.  My turkey club sandwich was PACKED with 2 small slices of turkey and tasted no better than the sandwiches that anyone could make from the comfort of their own home.  The only saving grace was the magnificent and diverse staff/chefs, who were nice, social, efficient, and must all have some type of reptile blood inside of them to be able to withstand the constant amount of ubiquitous heat on a daily basis.  Props to you guys."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The best bakery in SF! Wide bread selection & great service. I will come back and certainly recommend it to everyone.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"A delightfully healthy cafe near the UCSF Dental School in Fillmore. I met my gluten AND lactose intolerant friend here and we had a blast trying everything!  The egg white sandwhich, banana bread (regular, gluten free), granola/seeds bar, various out muffins, green smoothie (optional banana, ginger for 50 cents), and coffees (+variety of milks) are not to be missed! Additional seating is available upstairs."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"My favorite little café in Pac Heights! The line is insanely long during the lunch rush and table space is limited, so be prepared. But once you order, the food comes quickly."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Awesome cinnamon bun if you can get there early enough on the weekend but they do sell out fast. I've seen them set aside buns before for call-ins while I'm in line, not cool.  Personally I don't love the Stumptown coffee."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"My only qualm with Jane is that it's always packed! The coffee is good and as a celiac they have some of the best gluten free options I've found in SF. The atmosphere, despite being packed at all times, is also great whether you're going to do work solo or meet someone for mid-day coffee."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Ordered a matcha latte with oat milk. It's pretty average, not bad. I appreciate how it wasn't pre sweetened though"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I'm biased because of the name, but the smashed avocado toast with poached egg was fantastic - the pickled onions and jalapenos made it something special. Great diversity of breakfast options with reasonable prices, and great coffee!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great place for breakfast, very popular with gym goers. Very busy on weekends."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Can't really give more than 3 stars for simply having a single experience where 3 of us had a mocha, a hot chocolate, and bag of herbal tea. There are no A+'s given for the basics."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Fantastic, fresh food in Lower Pac Heights. Go for brunch or lunch or sip on a cappuccino and get some work done. Their salads are delicious and so are their berry bowls—you can’t go wrong here!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Excellent, flaky croissants and pastries. Good vibe and music. For breakfast get there before 8am if you want to score a table. It's very popular with locals."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Very crowded, slow service, but very tasty bakery and this dracont fruit smoothie bowl 😋 …"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Visiting from NYC for a business trip and came here on recommendation of a local. By far the best egg white sandwich I ate in my life. The cinnamon roll is amazing too. I will miss this place.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Worth walking past other cafes for. Coffee 4. Food 5. Service 5. Atmosphere 4. Value 5. Asian chicken salad was huge. Croissant = crisp tasty mess = perfect. Zesty chat latte.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Ok latte, ordered 2 lattes and they frothed the milk for both in one pitcher, but it was still nice. went here  on a warmer day, I don't think they have air conditioning. It wasn't comfortable"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,As I waited in line I saw a woman ahead of me return her fresh orange juice which she had sipped. It was left on show behind the counter. Later when I ordered a fresh orange I was served the one she had returned. This was all conducted by the same employee.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"This place has a special place in my heart. I love the name, I love the vibe (inviting but edgy-- how do they do that?!), and I LOVE the pastries and stuff coming out of these guys' kitchen. Whether you are tucking into an email reply-a-thon (note: the prime tables are reserved for cafe customers and not remote workers-- genius!), or coming to Jane with your family and friends, you'll feel welcome, stylish, and probably pretty hip. A lot of people would compare this place to The Mill, but that's in a different neighborhood. For me, I'm glad we've got our Jane. Make sure to get something on the bread that they make at their Mission location- it's absolutely divine."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,My wife and I have been in SF for a week on holiday from Australia. Over this week we have been to Jane 4x times. Their flat whites are the best in town and baked eggs are epic! We will miss this place 😞 …
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,This place is amazing. There salads was really fresh and soup was so good . had veg options. Great coffee. Very clean and open. You don't even notice the TL is right outside.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"They work so slowly here. Went in on the day that they were not too busy, not not quite ready yet. They ran out of alternative milks and there were three or four employees working there, but still took forever to get just a cup of cappuccino."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The croissants, the kouign amann and bread are all outstanding. Can't beat the chocolate chip cookie. Or the ginger cookie. Or the oatmeal white chocolate. But then, when you have to eat real food? I love the Cobb salad, and I love the curry chicken salad sandwich. You can't go wrong here at all."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I love Janes, it's an awesome breakfast spot in the city.  They have great creamy lattes, friendly staff, solid wifi connection, delicious pastries and food- the salmon platter is my personal favorite!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I’m embarrassed to say that even though I’ve been to Portland, I’ve never had their famous Stumptown coffee. When I discovered that Jane on Fillmore served it, I headed down there. I was sorely disappointed because there was a strong acidic note that left a sour after taste. If you want Stumptown, get the bottled cold brewed coffee.  I ordered the coffee cake with raspberries. It’s exactly what you expect when you pick up a coffee cake at CostCo – a bar above decent. I’m not shitting on CostCo’s baked goods, I’m just saying that Jane’s isn’t something to rave about.  I also ordered the tuna melt. It came with yellow cheddar, tomatoes, and while the tuna had a nice peppery bite, but there was too much mayo. I hate it when watery mayo seeps through the delicious buttery toasted bread and makes it soggy. Other than that, it was decent."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Their gluten-free baked goods are really full of flavor! If you have Celiac Disease, the toast might not be a good idea because of the cross-contamination in the toaster. I suggest warming it up at your home to be extra safe."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Two lattes one breakfast sandwich and one scrambled egg. $30. Great coffee great sandwich good service nice surroundings. I was tempted by the bakery items but was able to resist the temptation. Another day perhaps!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Really good coffee and ambiance/decor. Friendly staff. Food is good.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"It is almost annoying how busy it gets. If you don't want to wait, you'll have to visit after 3pm during the weekend. But I keeps coming back with the constantly changing dessert option. Coffee is wonderful too. There's a small 2nd floor are where you can work."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Muffin?! Did someone say muffin? My search for the cities best muffin has taken me to Jane. The bird seed muffin will fulfill any muffin-lovers dream. Jane is a trendy, urban cafe designed for people to meet, work and eat. The upstairs seating is a worker's paradise (except for the noise from the kitchen - you won't want to take calls from here). Downstairs is a hustle of city people enjoying their bowls of berries, freshly baked pastries, or healthy salads with ingredients you would never think go together. Highly recommend. A wonderful place. Coffee is made with love. Free wi-fi for all."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The place is good, staff is not kind. I ordered coffee at 530pm. The store was closing in 15 minutes and they didn’t tell me anything. I pointed out this point to a clerk and she never apologized. I had to leave half way coffee. Felt rushed."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Abit small but the food is nice
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I've been looking for a satisfying avocado toast since London. This just became my new favorite. Great coffee, friendly staff and funky decor."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"It's debatable what's Jane's ""other"" location: the one on Larkin or my to-go spot, the Fillmore Jane's. What's not debatable: you'll get quality coffee, delicious food, all in a lively PacHeights setting. With San Francisco prices. Salad = $9, Banana bread = $3, Chai Latte = $4.  Well, you'll forget about what you just paid once you take a sip of their home-made Chai, or munch on their fresh and tasty granola.  Very very busy, and it'll be hard to find seating any time of day. But: busy for a reason."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,I liked the latte and the cinnamon roll but it wasn't anything special. The place was quite crowded and the system was strange. But the place is nice and the cookie was delicious!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The food was good but it was a little pricey for what it was. Would have appreciated bigger portions but other than that the menu is great and I love the almond butter toast
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Way over hyped with a line of baby strollers passing directly through the dining area. Let all the new upper Fillmore families have this place. Avocado 'mash' (Safeway guacamole) toast is garbage.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,We enjoyed the tuna melt and deviled egg salad sandwich today. The tuna was our fav (peppery) but we were glad we tried the egg salad too.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Tuna on tuna melt was a little salty but overall still tasty. The orange morning bun (I think) was wonderful.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Orange juice, poured from a jug bought at a grocery store, should not cost $4. Maybe if they had squeezed the oranges themselves. Maybe if they grew the oranges in their backyard. Maybe if they weren't obvious about pouring the store bought orange juice in front of you just to make it clear that you are paying way more than you should be. On this point alone, I refuse to be a patron."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Wonderful vegan options and great matcha lattes. Staff was friendly and helpful. Best to go early morning if you want to get a seat!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Eternally busy, yuppie-meets-hipster cafe Jane serves Stumptown coffee in the heart of the Fillmore strip. You'll be hard-pressed to find seating and there's always a line, but coffee and tea aficionados in the neighborhood may find that it's worth it. Baristas use beakers and machines on seasonal beans and leaves to make the perfect cup for every preference. Pair your cup with one of their filling quiches or sweet treats, then go upstairs to see if you can snag one of the cushy seats. There's free wifi but outlets are hard to find if you come to work."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Try Chat toast! Loved it so much
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Chopped salad was great. The space was pretty filled up on a Sunday, but there were open tables upstairs. WiFi was acceptable."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The seating situation here is seriously stressful given people take tables before they’ve ordered. Coffee and food are both good but the layout of this place needs to be revisited.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"We had homemade Chai here - the best I had in a long time, as it was not too sweet (like most) but really nice and spicy. We also tried the Cuban Cortadito - which was lovely and the Mocha. Also a winner."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Lovely place for breakfast. I love their avocado toast and the muffin. Even though no service at all and too busy to get a table!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Nice coffee spot!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Jane is my favorite coffee shop on Fillmore. My usual there is a cappuccino and some biscotti. It usually gets pretty crowded. Its got free wifi and is a great place to work.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good coffee, great bread.  But man, it can be slow.  Long lines and barista process leaves a little to be desired.  Still worth every one of its four stars though."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Two of us stopped by Jane yesterday for Sunday lunch, where we had enjoyed the food several times before as locals. We were disappointed to find that loud music was blasting in our ears and decided to take our business elsewhere."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Avocado toast with pickled onions and peppers, good for digestive health. Detox tea, also good for my health."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Ok place for coffee and typical cafe food. It doesn't have wifi (shockingly) so not the place to get some work done.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Long line, didn’t have any cookies available except for some non-gluten ones (they were out of all the speciality cookies), didn’t call us to collect our drink orders so we just waited and waited."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great Cafe for good sourdough toast, coffee and pastries for a hang out if you are in the area"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Place used to be good. Avo toast used to be served hot with a poached egg now they plop a boiled egg on the cold avo a give you a 9 dollar cold toast.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The brussel sprouts/sweet potato/kale/quinoa salad served warm was fantastic!!  I am trying to recreate it right now! Joy in Boulder
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"This place has really gone down in quality. Don’t bother buying anything baked items. The cookies are more often than not, stale!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The best almond milk cappuccino I've had in a long time! My hubs also likes the cinnamon rolls.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Cookies don't seem as good as they used to be, like the crazy cookie. The staff at the register appeared to have more important things to do besides helping customers in line. Like me. 🤔 On a Tuesday at 1230. …"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great food with a nice cozy atmosphere
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Breakfast and quick bite type of place, crowded most of the time"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good coffee drinks, food, and setting. Can get busy at times, but that's to be expected."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,This place made my morning! Great healthy brunch food. The cakes are soo good too. Great service and good atmosphere too.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Mediocre food with shockingly slow meal prep times + terrible service. I will not return.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great, tasty, imaginative food and for the US the coffee is pretty good too. Staff need to lighten up and be a bit more enthusiastic about their work."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good but expensive food and lattes. I had some poor customer service when I was there, but they were extremely busy so I’ll cut them some slack on that!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Lots of delicious and healthy food options. Their upstairs seating has lots of outlets and is a pretty great place to post up and work for a bit.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great salads, Stumptown coffee!  Can be crowded at lunch so plan to come early (11:30) or late (1pm) to get a table."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Solid spot for baked goods and cafe fare. Seems like it'd be great for catering too. Like that they have tables with no laptops with plenty of others for.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Egg salad was good.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Cute cozy place. But it can get bit crowded
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Okay brunch place with long lines.  Nice choice of healthy and not so healthy choices. Biscuits with jam is really nice!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Their pastries are fantastic but the service was dreadful. The counter person literally messed up my order three times and I had to return because she didn’t give me all of my order.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Gets busy and space is limited. Food and coffee are awesome. All the baked goods are amazing.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Moderate food. No table arrangements, you need to search on your own. Most annoying was waiter tried to take our plate twice when we were eating and had food in the plates."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Way too slow. You can’t get even get a cup of coffee without wasting 20 minutes of your life. Jane, isn’t it high time to add multiple registers??"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Always very busy (be prepared to queue). However, the staff are epic! And the panini's are perfect with a flat white."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"This review is for the coffee. I got a macchiato, which was 3.5$. The espresso shot was very over extracted. Not what I expected for a 3.5$ macchiato in the city :S"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great sausage sandwich. Coffee was megh. Will try espresso next time
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Love this place! Visit regularly anytime we're in San Francisco. Great menu and the coffee is fab.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"The best coffee within walking distance of my house, by a huge margin. Also, the best cookies in San Francisco, bar none."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,One of the best green smoothies-fresh and packed full of greens
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Trendy coffee shop complete with mustached baristas and infamous avocado toast. Instagram-worthy lattes and wifi to please the masses.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Super busy on the weekends, but excellent, healthy choices. Good drink selection. Worth a breakfast trip."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Very dark coffee and overpriced (for my taste) this is definitely not a 3rd wave coffee shop.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Love this place!  Great little cafe for grabbing a coffee, having a meeting or hanging otu with friends.  I only wish it stayed open later."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good ginger biscuits, but waiting 15 mins for a plain espresso is too much, especially when they don't bother to tell you they've got a backlog."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"It's a pretty good coffee shop, very awesome latte. Most places don't know how to make it but these guys know. Thank you, awesome"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Lots of tasty looking pasteries!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Psssttt.....Jane also has a Tenderloin location! Come to the store on Larkin for the same awesome gluten free baked goods and Stumptown coffee!  Also, sandwiches!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"I arrived 5:17 and closed at 6pm, the cashier answered me badly, said that the schedule did not make the juice I wanted.  I will not be back any more"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great coffee shop.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Food and espresso were good, but you're paying a premium for the atmosphere and trendy menu options."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great coffee and excellent baked treats, including tasty GF/vegan options"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"It's popular place and deserves to be, but juices are very expensive.. it's more expensive than tuna melt sandwich!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great food and coffee. Nice service too, just might take long on weekends!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"A great cafe to sit and work if you have a Mac. The coffee is a bit burnt, but it's still better than Starbucks."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Coffee - cold brew nitro, drip or espresso - done well here. Healthy ingredients and delicious baked goods, too."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Good food, great location. Need more seats if they want to serve dishes good for dine in."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Best cappuccino I've ever had. Perfect combination of crispy to chewy and sweetness of the ""crazy cookie""."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"A bit crowded on the weekend, so need to be strategic about when to come. Otherwise, maybe less enjoyable when it's too crowded and you feel very rushed"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"always busy - coffee is good as are the baked goods.  nice to sit there and do work, especially if you have a mac"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,they serve stumptown coffee and sugar cookies with captain crunch. nuff said -- awesome study spot. free wifi.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Best coffee on Fillmore.  Food is always fresh and delicious.  Long lines at peak times.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Toast and granola was an excellent choice. A bit hectic but an excellent place for a casual breakfast or lunch
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Cute place but I had the $10 avocado toast and have been sick for 3 days.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Breakfast was great, coffee was ok. Slightly pricey but worth it for the quality."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Smoked salmon platter and fresh turmeric juice were awesome! Nice ambient and good service
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Egg white sandwich and banana bread are my general go to's. Really nice for light breakfast
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Great baked goods. Crowded, long wait/line, and crumbs everywhere, but love the baked goods."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,The coffee is really good. The food is OK. Lively atmosphere.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Friday routine before work is to stop at Jane and pick up olive bread for weekend  But for some reason no bread until 10.  Fix this!
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Toasts and bread were okay not the best I had so far. Not worth for the wait in line though.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"It can get crowded and stuffy during a warm day, so take your breakfast to go and head out to Alta Park to enjoy!"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Good food and drinks. Place gets busy. WiFi can be a little slow.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Seems to be a good place to have a light breakfast made with wholesome ingredients.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Skip the Peets and head here for great pastries (made on site) and expertly brewed espresso drinks.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Excellent sandwiches, prices surprisingly reasonable, very nice ambience/location"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,My dish was disappointing. I had the eggs in bean stew. Pastries and coffee were ok.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Run like a frat house ,dirty toilette,cookies and patisseries seem to be almost dead ,Asked for green tea and got a black tea, tables not clean , needs some professional help soon."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Too hot but good options for healthy food. Overpriced and very Fillmore but the service and ingredients are great
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"A nice atmosphere, but I bought a simple tea and it was $3 which I thought was expensive."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great bakery. I came in for a coffee and a snack and I enjoyed my time there.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,This place took forever to make my wife’s matcha latte lol
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Nice place to hang out. Good hot chocolate and cookies. Bathrooms were dirty though.
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Great coffee and brunch options with a great atmosphere in a lovely neighbourhood
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Love this place!! The food is so fresh & tasty. Defo recommend
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Its OKAY, but this store has always had problems with ""hotness"". No air flow and the place gets hot."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Ordered $6 latte wouldn’t let me use laptop at table...1 star is too generous
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Poor layout, people sitting and talking while tons of people are waiting for food, one rude worker with some additude , when I asked for a chair she said if you can find one you can sit"
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"Nice and cozy spot. The coffee, chai and cookies are quite good."
Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,Best baguette i've tried in SF. Delicious. Their cookies are also spot on.

Jane on Fillmore,2123 Fillmore St,"If you are nearby, be sure to try their brunch early in the morning.

The cashier male staff is also very friendly."

It's hard to go back and forth in the shop to secure a seat. Please improve on that."
