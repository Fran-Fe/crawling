Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Great neighborhood coffee shop with quality service and coffee. However it is one of the only places I know of that still does a covid style walk up order process. It’s a real bummer the inside is still closed as the vibes inside were once cozy and welcoming. I used to come here a lot but I opt for other coffee shops in the neighborhood if I’m looking for a sit down and relax vibe. Which is 9 times out of 10. Also, if you order a bagel, be sure to request it toasted brown otherwise you just get it warmed and it is bland. 5 stars if I can finally sit inside and enjoy the place."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,The shop is still mostly closed inside since covid. No where to sit. One person works the register + makes the coffee so line moves slow.
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Came here a few times during our stay in SFO. Ali was very friendly and gave us some good tips on places to visit. Most importantly, the coffee was excellent."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"A cute hole in the wall cafe. Literally covered in green leafy plants  from the street view. It is a cute and cozy place. The girl who assisted me was so helpful and patient. She referred a white chocolate temptation ice coffee. Trying to watch my plastic, she was kind enough to put my iced coffee in a glass cup for me. I will definitely be coming back soon to try more."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Ali, Michael and the Central Coffee crew are always exactly who and what you want from a Bay Area neighborhood coffee shop. Good strong beans served up with a smile and great, fun, eclectic music, fueled at the heart by a sense of shared concern for customers and the continued well being of the neighborhood."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Love this place. Still has the original coffee shop vibe, if you are looking for the minimal sterile tech break room coffee vibe, this isn’t your place. Some of the best coffee in Sf at some of the best prices. Every kind of milk alternative you could ask for. I’ve never been disappointed with the food. Some of these comments below seem like they are rating a breakfast restaurant, it’s a coffee shop... you know, you order coffee, grab something on the side, read a book, do some writing, drawing or work on something. Maybe you even grab and go.  Anyways, so glad I live in walking distance and myself and my dog can enjoy our treats on the seats outside. Stay golden. You guys are a gem."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"I was honestly hoping to love this place, especially since everyone there is so friendly. The coffee was decent, but the food left a bit to be desired. I got a lox bagel sandwich (my favorite) and requested no onions, unfortunately this resulted in them not adding capers. They were also out of the bagel I wanted, but it was understandable with it being 10am on a Saturday. Sadly the bagel I did select was very over toasted. It was more crouton than bagel. Halfway through my sandwich I just removed the top half. My fiance ended up ordering the ham off the bone sandwich. (They didn't really have ANY breakfast listed). It was a good sized sandwich and looked well made. The ingredients looked fresh and delicious. Unfortunately the oil they used on the sandwich was a bit overpowering and you couldn't taste a whole lot past that. I'm not sure if I'll go back, but if I do it will only be for coffee and great service."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"I love this coffee shop, a real community cafe! Tasty bagels and sandwiches, cappuccinos & macchiatos. Wonderful employees, and an owner with a heart of gold. Ali has been in the neighborhood a long time, and is known to donate food and coffee for local events like the neighborhood block party. Feels good to support a place like this. As others have said, thanks for keeping it real!"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Not good, pastries are store bought"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"This is a beloved and wonderful local coffee shop in NOPA. If you drop by, it's likely that you'll meet the owner who will convince to grab one of their many amazing pastries. This place has a great vibe and I suggest their iced chai. I personally am not a big fan of their drip coffee or lattes, but I still like to swing by when I'm in the mood for a treat or chai."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Nice location. Chai had good flavor but was a little watery, even if oak milk. Croissant cinnamon roll was delicious and veggie bagel was good."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"This is the 2nd time I have ordered from here and my order was less than pleasing.  When you order a bagel, first you expect that it will be toasted not warmed and second when you ask for cream cheese and avocado you don't expect the avocado to be brown and squished or at least I don't. For as much as you pay at this place you would think that presentation would matter as much as the quality of the food. Failing on both ends if you ask me."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,This has been my go to local coffee spot for a year now and the staff is very friendly. They took the time to remember my name and order.
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"One of the favorite cafes in the neighborhood. Great coffee, big selection of teas and great sandwiches and pastries. Nice atmosphere, I usually go there for all morning with my laptop and work/skype with family and friends. When is nice outside you can sit on the tables in the sidewalk. Pet friendly, always dogs around and they give you a big water bowl for your furry friends"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,Always  a great casual cafe ! Been coming here for 3 years . It’s open today : Memorial Day 5/30/22 7am-12pm  Only take out bc COVID
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"In love with their veggie bagels, coffee and service! The staff is super kind and always cheerful. I’ve also gotten their pastries and sandwiches. Highly recommend the vegan sandwich and croissant melts!"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"The staff is really nice, its a humble place and feels untouched by the new wave of tech. So happy this is our local coffee shop. The veggie croissants with munster cheese are my go to!!!"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Nice people.  Good coffee and sandwiches.    They didn't have the wild salmon today, so used normal smoke instead and gave me the $2 difference back.   Neighborhood local scene, outdoor seating.   Would go back."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Let the customer wait more than 10 mins to get the order and the morning bun was burnt without a sorry. They replaced the order is almond croissant, and I doubt it’s probably couple days old because it’s very dry and hard... on the other hand, the staffs are nice and pace it’s lovely...."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,I use to visit here when I was a kid but now this is my second home. I love the ambience of this place and the staff was really good and friendly.
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"This was my ""local"" for a week. The staff were consistently friendly and efficient. The coffees were OK but I am a New Zealander and our coffee is a hard act to follow. I loved the feel of this place and its convenience to the MUNI and the Panhandle, Haight & Golden Gate Park. A great place to start the day, thanks peoples you were just lovely!"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Do not come here. It's mine. It has no hipster vibe to it at all. To me it represents a neighborhood centric tradition of cafes with used furniture where people camp out and are conscious to support the business often because they care so much about it sticking around. That being said, do come here. But don't be surprised if it's not within the scope of the on demand model of business. It's friendly, often busy, the bagels address really satisfying and they have no frapuchinos, you might get a florete on your cap but likely you won't. The standard roast is a medium dark. And they also keep a brighter medium sumatra on drip as wellBut this is not a place run by someone without taste. They consistently try new menu items and people come back. Starbucks is a block away so the level of service and quality here shows value.. It's less about simple function than it is about family.. I often watch people sigh heavily at the happy exchanges between Batista and customer when they are in a rush behind it is not But they're not ignoring you. They are a bit of glue trying the residents together and it requires conversation. The tables get filled with people on laptops during the day in the shrinking market of places to work or goof off in public. Do go earlyb as needed. When you plan on"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Great neighborhood place with coffee and drinks you'd expect. I don't want to tell you how good their pastrami croissant sandwiches are because I don't want you to eat them all before I get there, but I suppose I can share."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Great place to get your morning coffee! I wanted a pumpkin spice latte but as they did not have, they made me a dirty spice latte which tastes just like a pumpkin spice latte! Amazing!"
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Central Coffee is one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. It is a humble spot without the unnecessary posh of other coffee spots in the city, but with excellent coffee and sandwiches at a reasonable price."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"First sip of my latte with oat milk, and I was in heaven. Smooth, rich, not bitter and pronounced caramel notes. May be I just got lucky..but it’s the best I had in a while ..."
Central Coffee Tea & Spice,1696 Hayes St,"Also, pro tip if you don't want to wait in line there's a cart right outside that serves cold brew, New Orleans, and 3 different kinds of hot coffee. Super convenient to grab and go!"
