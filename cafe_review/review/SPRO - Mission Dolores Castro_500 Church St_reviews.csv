SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"SPRO is my favorite cafe in a city with many great options. You can see from my photos (not even everything I've ordered, apparently I consumed my food every time without taking a photo first) that I keep coming back, and have ordered most of the menu.  The coffee and tea menu is divine. Not only is it the most creative list of coffee and latte variations that I've seen, they are impressively all well executed. Great sourcing of ingredients, additional components are made in house, no synthetically flavored syrups. Try the spro on its own with a few berries to complement, too. You won't get a burnt or overly acidic pull of espresso here, all the flavors are balanced and the staff are regularly calibrating things.  Speaking of the staff, they are fantastic. The owners have put in so much care, curating not just a great food and drink selection but also a talented and friendly team. Whether I come with a friend or by myself, every visit to SPRO is a good one.  Bonus: Great dog spotting! There's a lil menu for the pups 💜"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Lovely little coffee shop super close to Dolores Park. Really like their modern interior and large drink menu! Tried strawberry fields and it was super refreshing and flavorful. Salmon sandwich was to the point as well! Mild salty salmon, cream cheese, capers and lettuce - ideal proportions and great taste. Like outdoor seating when it’s sunny. The service is fast. They bring your order to your table even if you seat outside. Highly recommended!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Delicious, hearty breakfast with high quality ingredients and so many fun drinks—stuck with the classics this time around but wish I could try them all!  First time visiting the brick and mortar after years of going to the food truck at Spark Social in Soma back when I worked nearby. Stumbled upon while searching for breakfast spots on Google maps and was delighted to find this a 1 min walk from Dolores Park nearby to our Airbnb.  Staff were friendly and thoughtful, giving me a heads up that while the Italian sausage was fully cooked, it might still look a bit pink inside due to being cooked 24 hours sous vide. They assured me it was really good, and they were right! Had to take the second sausage to go and it was great breakfast the next day."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"My favourite coffee shop in the city, from the ambience to the consistently delicious coffee. Such a great place to get work done or sit down with some friends"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Had the Tea Thyme and New Orleans seasonal coffees - both were delicious! Service was great and the person working at the register was awesome! Love all the creative coffee flavors they have!
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Good coffee, nice flavor combinations, not too sweet, pricy. I wouldn’t do a $6-$7 small latte regularly, but it’s a nice treat. The rose cardamom latte was tasty, not overpowering, and is made with a house-made syrup. The cardamom was a little gritty but it was fine. It’s a bright, clean space, I didn’t find it unpleasantly sterile. There’s counter seating, but it’s not a super comfortable space where I’d want to sit and work at length."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"I got the umami bomb, super tasty and looks good too. Very flavorful, generous avocado, tasty microgreens. The bread was also good, which makes or breaks a toast."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"really great coffee at spro - it definitely seems like they have good practices and dial in their coffee very well. vibes are great too!!  tried an espresso shot, pour over, and one of their seasonal drinks (pixie dust)  the espresso and pour over were both exactly what you want, they were well extracted and clean  the pixie dust was really wild, it was like a latte but with strong citrus and spice flavors. honestly it’s not for everyone (and i’m still not sure how much i liked it myself) but i’m glad they’re having fun with it and trying to make drinks that might speak to a smaller audience"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"My husband and I are visiting SFO for the first time and we ordered from this place because of the reviews... Damn we were wrong. I'll leave a pic of the food below so you tell me if that's something you'd eat. Looks bad, tastes bad and it's overpriced.  Two stars because we also ordered moshi waffles and those were decent."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"I feel like the coffee/specialty drinks can be hit or miss, and during peak times it can be hard to find seating.  As a cafe, their extensive food menu is pretty unique. They have more than just the typical cafe food of toast and sandwiches. I mean they also have toast and sandwiches, but they put their own fancy spin on things. I haven’t tried anything else because I ALWAYS get the avocado toast. It’s embarrassing how many times I’ve gotten the avocado toast since it feels like one of those things that I should just make at home. But this one is elevated. They call it the “umami bomb” and it has the perfect balance of savory, sweet and sour (from the ponzu, and ~umami~ (I think from truffle oil), and is topped with (optional) ikura roe. This is the epitome of the avocado toast."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Amazing drinks! Great shakshuka toast and egg sando.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Absolutely delicious food that blew my mind (loved everything but top favorites are Mash Up and Strawberry Guava Mochi Waffles). Best coffee hands down with extensive and unique menu. Wonderful service and wonderful people.  Living two blocks away is officially dangerous for my wallet.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Loved their single origin Ethiopian pour over coffee! I had it straight for three mornings. Food is tasty as well. I had toast and eggs and another pastry with eggs and bacon ,that I can't remember the name. Both were good. Small but great place to sit indoors or outdoors with your book, laptop etc."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Cute cafe/coffee shop in the Castro/Dolores area. My first experience with SPRO was in Mission Bay. This location is a full cafe. This location features a large selection of sandwiches, a few breakfast items, and a few pastries.  I tried a turkey sandwich and a Mardi Gras drink. The sandwich was large and had a good mix of meat and vegetables. It was a bit dry and could of used a little more mayo or dressing. But I figured I should be healthy so I didn’t ask for more. I wish the sandwich came with a little salad or pickle, or have the option for $1 more, but the sandwich alone was filling.  The cold brew drink was tasty! They specialize in creative coffee and tea drinks that you can’t find elsewhere. Instead of just adding a syrup, they use other items like reductions, herbs, sparkling water, and natural ingredients. I’d highly recommend trying one of their specialty drinks! I really enjoyed the cold brew. It’s hard to find a good, strong cold brew, and they nailed it.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to offer suggestions. You don’t see this type of service in most places.  My only wish is that they had more seating. But I’ll be back soon!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"The coffee and breakfast items we ordered were absolutely delicious! I tried the orange blossom coffee and shakshuka, my husband tried eggs and sausage. The shakshuka is so good that we ended up dunkin in the sausages in it as well. I highly recommend this place. Also great service and reasonably priced. The insides of the cafe itself is not much to look at, but if you are going for a good affordable breakfast, give this place a try, will not regret it!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Stopped by here for a quick latte on my way to Dolores Park. We tried the Orange Blossom Latte which was quite good. Only downside is the lack of seating, which is quite limited."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Absurdly good pour over coffee (be a little patient), and a fancy coffee “cocktail” menu that I want to try everything on. Spoil your dog with their dog treat menu. Spoil yourself with their spiced chocolate coffee. Chat with the friendly owner. Spot on coffee shop!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Great concept, different from other coffee shops. I originally requested a cappuccino but then saw they had a menu of season specialities, I went for a warm ginger coffee and it was terrific! 🤩"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,I used to be an early customer of their Mission Bay food truck location and I’m so happy they opened this brick and mortar restaurant 🙌🏼  Finally visited them today and I loved that the flavors I used to be addicted to are still the same as they were almost 3 years ago ❤️  I chose my old time favorites: the mash-up and the umami bomb 🥰  They have more items than they used to and I have no doubt they’re all amazing!  Bonus point: the location is dog-friendly! 🐕
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,This place has the dopest bathroom in San Francisco.  The toilet's all futuristic and the music was thumping.   10/10 will definitely recommend and go back often.   The people were friendly and served good coffee too.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"one of the more inventive coffee places in the city with lots of unique options to try out. however, i was pretty disappointed with the drink I got. might try again to try the more simple coffees but not rushing to go back anytime soon.  service was also pretty bad - not only was it hard to get the workers attention, but they really acted like they didn’t want to be there  pixie dust: it tasted too strongly of the added ingredients and took away from the espresso itself."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Been going to the Soma location since it opened to treat myself, my wife and our dogs. Food and drinks here are amazing especially the waffles. But todays doggie treat was less then desirable. No rice added at all…"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Made a quick stop here during the busy pride Sunday. My Mocha was prepared quick and tasted good. Just about everything was packed but luckily this place wasn’t cutting corners. 4.7/5.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Great coffee and brunch spot, with not so standard items on the food or drinks menu. I enjoyed my Tokyo matcha drink, that has rose syrup in it. As well as my toast with truffled mash potato and perfect eggs. The manager and rest of the team were all very friendly!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Loved the quality coffee here and wide variety of food and drink options. Sous vide sausage and eggs were amazing. Single origin pour over done well too.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,We tried the cappuccino and the cortado (called gibby on the menu) and both were absolutely amazing! 5/5
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"My absolute favorite spot. I was super sad the previous owner had to close during COVID but low and behold SPRO really brought the next level.  The coffee is excellent. I usually go for a spro and they have always been spot on. If you want some milk too, be prepared for some art and perfect temperature.  Their inventive side is more science than you'd think. The cold fashion is a celebration of flavors really bringing the essence across and not a mere imitation. I am not for anything in my coffee but at SPRO i do venture into it.  And their food happens to be spot on too. They use sugar sparingly, letting flavors speak for themselves. From the oatmeal to the umami bomb, go for it!  Great spot to spend some time and try some stuff indoor or out watching the trams and people flow by."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Expensive but sophisticated coffee. This place sets itself apart from your usual chain or run-of-the-mill coffee joint. Their flavors are very unique!  We ordered the Cold Fashioned and Mardi Gras. Cold Fashioned was lightly sweetened with an orange peel burnt and infused to the coffee. The Mardi Gras was a tad sweet but reminded me of a toned down version of the ""Orleans"" coffee drink from Blue Bottle Coffee. Both are excellent"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Incredible coffee shop and cafe. The most innovative coffee drinks you’ve ever had, AND incredible food. I walk a mile once a week to go here. You have to try it"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"This is the only place in San Francisco that deserves a perfect 5 star rating. They do everything right from their incredible customer service to their food, dog menu, aesthetic, and even their bathroom. I wish I found this place in the first day of my trip."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,18% tip minimum in a place where they serve you a 7$ latte in a plastic cup. You're also supposed to pick up your order at the counter and clean your table after you're done.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Was informed as a first time patron about the name and the specialities. I enjoyed being able to interact with the staff members and the rest of the folks inside were doing their thing but interacted in a friendly environment. I got the fifty shades and I'd definitely come back and get more.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Coffee lab and minimalist cafe...wonderful staff and even better coffee and pastries.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Spro Coffee Lab is the Jam! I firmly believe there are no rules to coffee, only best practices. Spro has fun. Coffee is supposed to be fun so chill out, order a few drinks and take your time with this place or you might miss out. They have a lot to offer the the coffee community. They’ve experimented for our enjoyment!  Cheers Spro Coffee Labs!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Busy shop, but good coffee especially for those who are fans of blue bottle type coffee. There are so many options for coffee and food. I look forward to returning."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Had a great Americano here. Also had the egg, cheddar, bacon pastry, which was good but (surprisingly) served cold. I heated it in a toaster oven and it tasted much better. Inside of the cafe is very white, almost a sterile vibe. Everything is quite expensive. Nice baristas, although it’s not especially quick."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Something new happening with the cafe idea for San Francisco. Modern minimalist white interior. Almost everyone there working on their laptops. Nobody over 30. Near a high school so some students too.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Spro is a hip coffee bar along Church Street corridor. They offer the classic coffee drinks, tea and chai with choices of milk. Their special drink menu offers coffee mixology magic! Their combos read like a composed dish. I came in for a cold chai with almond milk. Got a brown butter chocolate chip cookie 🍪 too. The patrons are hipsters with their dogs 🐶. Def the Mission District set looking to people watch. And this is a nice sunny spot! There are two tables out in front providing a great watchers perspective. Spro has a huge glass front for natural light. Will come back for a Hong Kong milk tea or Strawberry Fields (has muddled strawberries!). Breakfast food looks tasty too! Impressed!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Delicious oats and a large portion. Tasty coffees. Lots of different food choices from snacks to larger bites.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"This is the first physical location for the SPRO coffee truck in Mission Bay, and if that is any indication, this new location is going to be AMAZING! (Open July 10) Can’t wait to see what the owners have done with their first brick and mortar store.  Here’s some of what you can expect, based on my extensive experience at their Mission Bay location.  Service: Very friendly and they love dogs! (in mission bay there is a menu for your pups!)  Food & Drinks: Creative and delicious. You can’t go wrong with what you choose, but if it sounds different, I recommend trying it! I’ve sampled food and drinks across their menu at Spark SF, and there are plenty of delicious espresso, tea, mocktails, and food options to try!  Atmosphere: Laid back. I have no idea what kind of music they play in their mission bay location, but it makes their corner of the Spark food truck park feel like it’s own little oasis of a coffeeshop.  TLDR: You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu. This lovely team is expanding locations and are creative geniuses with their food and drink options.  While I encourage you to try a variety of options from their menu, my personal favorites are the Kat’s Pajamas and salmon bagel sandwich. Enjoy!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"This place has lots of fun drink options. The food is also great, especially the mash up and the chocolate chip cookies!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Good coffee but service could've been better - faster to be specific, they took around 15 mins to serve us our coffee to go. I'd still go back to try the food and other drinks"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Rarely give five stars but the lattes are phenomenal. Great seating area inside and out to catch up with a friend. Close to mission delores park for a quick walk. Great pastries and breakfast sandwiches as well!
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Very unique bistro coffee shop, another hidden gem that’s open early enough in the morning to catch on my way to work. On the corner of 17th street/ 500 Church. Drove by around 7:30 am and had to turn around. It definitely beats the Starbucks train which doesn’t satisfy my thirst for an intentional brew - I ended up getting a drip coffee over 2 shots w/a splash of white chocolate & a morning smoothie called Urban Jungle & a Strawberry Guava pillow pastry.!! YUMMM  (Urban Jungle - Kale, spinach, chard, Banana, coconut, pineapple and Honey! *Strawberry Guava Pillow- exactly that. A soft crispy/flaky pastry w/ a generous amount of sliced strawberries atop a Guava blanket of nectar! -Red Eye coffee w/ white chocolate)  I’ll be back again. The staff was pleasant and welcoming ❤️"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Great corner spot with lots of sunshine! Coffee and food is delish.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Some really cool coffee cocktails! Had the sangria (they make it nonalcoholic with an espresso shot) and it was amazing. Really good fruity vibe
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"A few days ago randomly found this place and I loved it. Their Latte is amazing. Friendly staff, great location!! Highly recommending!"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"My wife had one of the best decaf lattes from here today.  It was Madagascar vanilla decaf latte with oat milk and she found it to be quite delicious (perfectly balanced sweetness with a touch of honey and the oat milk).  She has challenges getting a good flavour from other places since she is avoiding caffeine and dairy, but they get it right here.  Also she is enjoying trying their wide menu of subtle and tasty flavours."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Great selection of interesting coffee and tea drinks!
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Great central location in the mission and delicious drinks!
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Probably the best kept secret of the cafe world.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Really great drinks, food, and atmosphere. The people are super nice too."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Great pour over coffee with some nice outdoor seating. The umami bomb can easily be made vegan and it is DELICIOUS!  🌎sustainability rating: 4 out of 5. Better than most coffee shops. They used real cups for coffee for dine in and the food was all served with reusable utensils and dinnerware.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Great food and options! Coffee was great too
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,pretty mediocre coffee for the price. staff is overbearing and enthusiastic which can be awkward when i just want a drink quickly. also no barista has ever called espresso “spro” that i’ve ever known. not saying it doesn’t happen but it just feels cringe.
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Spro has great drinks, ambiance, and wifi!  My favorites are the Madagascar vanilla latte and the After School chocolate smoothie."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Today I randomly stumbled in here and had the Pixie Dust latte and let me tell you it is a bougie latte person’s dream! I can honestly say this was one of the best and most interesting lattes I have ever had. Many layers of delicious flavors and ingredients, no dairy, super smooth espresso, it was a work of art. This place is new to the neighborhood and I can honestly predict that it  will be a hit among the complex palates of San Franciscans. I just selfishly hope I won’t have to start waiting in the famous San Francisco line around the block, even though it will be a testament to how special this shop is."
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,I wish I got the names of the two sweet baristas that spoke to my fiancé and I while visiting San Francisco. We stumbled across Spro and decided to give it a chance but were definitely skeptical reading some of the drink names. Trust them they have great recommendations!! I am still thinking about the Pixie Dust I ordered. The baristas were speaking to us as they made the drinks and gave us so many great recommendations on what we should with the rest of our day. We took their advice and got a view of the city at Bernal Heights and went to the dumpling place as well; their hospitality was great and when I visit again I’m absolutely stopping at Spro again
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,"Drinks are interesting and look tasty, but we had to leave without ours (after paying) because it took 25+ minutes for them to be made and there was no sign of them coming out anytime soon. I think they should let people know when ordering if they’re behind  Edit: our friends who stuck around checked in a few times and after ~50min and they said they never got the order (but our cards were charged) and remade them"
SPRO - Mission Dolores Castro,500 Church St,Sous Vide eggs are cooked perfectly. Specialty drink menu is unique and extensive. Good service. Will return.
