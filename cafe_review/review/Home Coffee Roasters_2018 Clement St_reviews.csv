Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Very nice cafe deep on Clement street. The area is very calm and the home coffee roasters reflects that. There were mostly people working without taking meetings as the sound is somewhat noisy. It was such a great place to work though! Also got the vanilla latte which was really good. Want to to go back and try their other drinks as well, especially the cool, colorful ones 🔥"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"This place is the sweetest spot for coffee lovers. Right in the beginning of china town it attracts locals and tourist. It wasn’t really crowded for a Sunday morning, which came to my surprise. They have a great variety of pastries, toasts, coffee and tea. Everything that we ordered was on point, was precisely what we were looking for. And the place itself is pretty cosy. We just loved it. Levander latte beyond my expectations, it was simply amazing 🤩"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"This is a locally & minority owned coffee shop that def knows how to make some amazing coffee 💜 they have your regular coffee drinks but also some very creative ones, def try one of their specials. They have amazing mochi muffins, and their avo toasts are absolutely delicious. The staff is super friendly and the place itself very cute."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Finally realized I haven’t reviewed this location but I’ve been coming to home cafe since they started and Karl is one of the original employees who runs this location and I love supporting him. Always has a friendly smile and an awesome crew serving all your favorites. I tried the s’mores latte and it was playful and whimsical. They also have cute gear as well, come check it out!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Always a fan of local coffee shops but this one is one of my favorites! Great place to study as well as just hang out and I’ve loved trying every drink on the menu! Would recommend for anyone that’s a coffee fan
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"I don’t drink coffee at all, but since I moved close to this place, I started, and let me tell you is not because I love coffee is because of the service here; they are friendly and kind and make me feel welcome so basically now I'm drinking mocha almost every day, the best place in the neighborhood"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Cute local coffee shop. Good coffee. Nice place to sit and get some work done or meet a friend.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,I didn’t win the $1.08 billion Powerball last night but this delicious and beautiful Matcha Latte sure made up for it.  💚💚💚
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Love this place. Been to Home Cafe couple times at Sunset location. First time at Richmond location. Both sites offer same amount of sitting. Great selection of latte & their toasts are tasty. Reasonable price.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"I initially had gotten to experience a coffee and muffin from Home from their other location thru my friend who brought these delights to me as freebies. So I can now express I must have honestly liked them that much I searched for their location on Clement (closer to me) and ordered the lavender latte and mochi muffin again. These are my new favorites as of now on my search for a new coffee in the mornings routine. The staff was very nice I, the place was clean and creative. The bench that sits along the tables on the wall was a little high for me. I definitely will come back and try other items on the menu otherwise."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"The coffee: I rarely get a latte because I think it's just too much milk, but I could not pass up the excellent latte art and interesting flavors I read about them having. Often, I'll go to places that post pictures of their elaborate art only for them to do very basic or boring designs when I actually order coffee. I was not disappointed here. Of the five different lattes we ordered, each had it's own unique flair, and each individual one was more interesting than any I had seen anywhere else. I got the Nutella latte and it tasted like if you mix an espresso shot into your hot chocolate. It was very good because I like hot chocolate but definitely not for the coffee purist.  The shop: I liked the decor, but it was a bit dimly lit. It was a nice place to meet up with friends and take pictures of coffee, especially with the natural lighting and more blueish hues. If I'm in town again I would love to come back here."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,FANTASTIC LITTLE JOINT  - br-avo toast is very savory - cappuccino is what I order when I try a new spot out to judge espresso skills. Cap was wonderful - third culture bakery mochi goods always welcome in my stomach  gonna come back to continue supporting this spot!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Love this new location in my backyard! It’s a cute little cafe with great and unique drinks (modern spins on traditional drinks) and an Asian-fusion theme that continues to their food. Lavender latte is my fave but they have drinks with cookie batter and their avocado toast is really good, I prefer the avocuddle 🤗. Usually a few people in front of me in line but quick service regardless. Everyone is super friendly too!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"I drink a lot of coffee, and the vanilla coconut latte is hands down one of the best lattes I’ve ever had! We have been twice and both times the staff was incredibly nice, and we didn’t have to wait long, even with a little bit of a line. Their corn and red pepper empanada was fantastic. We are visiting from out of town and out of all the places we have been, I will miss this one the most! If you’re looking for a phenomenal coffee experience, don’t miss Home!!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"The Art of Coffee!  Thank you Instagram for bringing this place to my attention. This coffee place promises happiness. You'll find coffee in a different kind of variations: with Nutella, lavender, red velvet, birthday cake, etc.  Each creative coffee is a hand-crafted piece of art. I felt in love with the rainbow-colored birthday cake latte ($5). The taste is vanilla & hazelnut. Also the Nutella latte ($5)conquered my heart. Yes, you read correctly: NUTELLA Latte! It absolutely tastes like Nutella and you can find some Nutella at the bottom of your cup.  After having tried all these different creations, I didn’t want to leave without getting the Rose Latte. No regrets at all. Turned out this one was my favorite flavor. Not too sweet, not too intense. Just perfect. Served with dried rose pedals.  Next time, I definitely want to try the Lavender Latte.  This is definitely a place to bring your friends, family and visitors to brag how cool coffee in San Francisco can be!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"A small-ish menu more geared towards a light brunch, which is actually a welcome relief for SF. The cafe is absolutely gorgeous and has a wonderful ambience. The staff couldn't be lovelier and the quality of food is fantastic. I'm docking one star for cost, all brunch in SF is pricy but I did feel that this was at on the steeper end. Still very much enjoyed and will come back to try some of their speciality coffee's"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Excellent drip coffee! They roast their own beans and are talented at it. Highly recommend the drip or any of their incredible, creative lattes. The Sea Salt Caramel is my husbands favorite, but you really can’t go wrong with any of them."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Amazing drinks like lavender latte, oh my heavens, so delicious! Coffee roster on site, equipment visible. Kind and friendly staff. Spotless restroom. Almond, soy, oat and dairy milk available, but not low-fat or nonfat. Some breakfast + lunch items and ice cream! See menu photo."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Delicious and beautiful! It was surprising to me that they can do it with non dairy milk because it’s so hard to froth the non dairy milks. They were also very nice.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,A lovely Cafe that's really grown up in the neighborhood! Solid for coffee and a good selection of creative and fun sweet lattes! They have a good amount of space for a Cafe and efficient staff. Parking is a challenge in this neighborhood so bus walk or bike might be the better alternative.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Great coffee. Especially enjoy the creative choices like red velvet latte and birthday cake latte. Friendly and helpful baristas take wonderful care preparing drinks.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Delicious creative lattes, with the best avocado toast I’ve ever had! Highly recommend 👍🏻"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Menu pictured is current as of Jan 25, 2021. The Holy Cow condensed milk latte is slap-yo-mama good, the Seoul Avo Toast is delicious and different with the kimchee and avocado spread making a strange and cool party in my mouth. We also had the Br- Avo Toast and the Organic Matcha Tea Latte. All very good. Pricing not too cheap, but a little cheaper than comparable SF places. Welcome to the San Francisco fusion mix!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Cute coffee place. Definitely feels like home ❤️
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,I’ve never fall in in love so much with a latte. May be an exaggeration or accurate. It’s up to you to find out. I tried the coconut vanilla latte and I will be back to try a lavender later. Also if you don’t love super sweet drinks they will adjust sweetness to your taste :)
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"As others have said, a college student’s paradise! Also has the most creative coffee combinations but most of them are overly sweet! You can ask to make it less sweet. Definitely is a nice place to go to take pictures of the food ;)"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Had the birthday cake latte! Staff was kind and welcoming. Music can be a little loud if you're looking to concentrate and get some work done but at least it's good music :) they played Christmas tunes
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Amazing rose latte! 🌹 I asked for half-sweet with oat milk and it was perfect for me, just the right touch of rose flavor. Alex took the time to draw up some super cool latte art which made me smile — because I’ve been to more than 40 different coffee shops this year in California alone and no barista has yet to do something this lovely for a to-go cup! And Daniel was so patient at explaining what goes in their flavored coffees (those I was considering ordering), highly personable, and an absolute delight to talk to. I know I sound like their mom writing this review but I swear I’m just a millennial who’s blown away by good service in these COVID? — post-COVID? — times. Definitely earmarking it as my go-to coffee shop for whenever I’m in the Richmond neighborhood."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Super friendly service–the person ringing me up warned me that my latte would be very colorful, and wouldn't taste like a birthday cake, but more like a vanilla/hazelnut latte–and very fun menu items. They have a huge toast menu and a very experimental drink menu. A lot of very sweet options. If you want to take beautiful pictures of toast and coffee drinks, this is the place for you. The atmosphere feels bright and cozy, and the Birthday Cake Latte, though too sweet for an everyday treat, was fantastic."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Birthday cake latte is incredible!!love the tasty  foam and the super special colorful latte art! Deco was so modern and nice! Service was great:)) 10/10!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"So amazed by this birthday cake latte I got, in the middle of a busy hour too! The baristas are here are so talented. I hope they're getting paid and tipped by everyone super well!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"A bit pricey, but with good coffee and yummy toasts. My friend had the rose latte and the rose flavor was perfect - not too light and not too overpowering - though a bit sweet for my plain latte self. We shared a kimchi toast that was a good balance of flavors as well."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Coffee was actually nice but one of the workers (guy with longish black hair that looks like Adam Driver) was atrocious - he was curt with me for bringing food with me from outside (a small ziplock bag of like 15 grapes). Fair enough if you don't allow outside food but chill
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Found this coffee place on a visit to San Francisco. The space is really clean, well decorated and spacious. It looks like they're expanding their space and will have an outdoor space as well. They have a really awesome creative menu with items such as a rainbow latte(picture attached). They even made a totoro latte art at our request! The staff was really really nice and welcoming, my favorite part of the visit was the service. They have wifi as well. Music was on point.  My cortado was really good. The espresso has a really nice flavor profile to it, and the milk was steamed well(which is rarer than you'd expect) I had the avocado toast sampler which was absolutely delicious.  Excited to come back here and try more items on the menu! 10/10 would recommend."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,So many fun and unique drinks here. I had the cookie butter latte (iced) and there were literally mini cookies floating on top it was the cutest thing ever. The staff was so friendly and gave us some recommendations for places to visit and eat in the city. Baked goods and avocado toasts are a must try as well!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Masterpieces to drink! Just beautiful! My daughter really wanted to go here for her birthday, and it was worth the trip. We tried birthday cake latte and hot chocolate and both were excellent!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Heard about this place from so many friends and I’m so glad that I took the time to go visit this cute coffee on a sleepy street in the Richmond. The menu offers some of the cutest drinks I’ve ever seen and look forward to my next visit ☕️🌈☕️ …
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,They make a really good oat chai!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"If you like to make coffee at home, and you like to taste your coffee, hard to go wrong with ordering freshly roasted beans from your local roaster. And if you order from home you get free sticker(s) and confetti with each order! The competition among roasters in San Francisco is fierce, but Home Coffee quietly holds it's own in one of the city's foodie hot spots, Clement street."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Good service. Their drinks are really good as well. I prefer the Noriega location though. Roasts are amazing though I wouldn’t get them again, way too pricey. Both location does get back so be prepared to wait for a table to open up or just get your stuff to go."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"They had everything to get five stars. And the reason I didn't give them five is something personal. Their level of roast of coffee seems a bit lighter and im pretty sure that is the leading cause of ""acidity"" in coffee. Drinking a lighter roast seems to give an acidic taste you usually do not detect in darker roasts. Again, this is a personal taste, so some of you may very well enjoy the lighter roast. The place is comfortable, very much needed in this area, and has a few snacks/bakery items that are reason enough to come back! The mochi muffin is awesome. I didnt see honey to sweeten my coffee but im sure they can provide that. The photo shows a double ecpresso $3.25 and the Mochi muffin $4"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Decent iced coffee at a fair price. Not a lot of variety of sweeteners but that is okay.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Bravo avacado toast was excellent, i swapped the radish for tomatoes, very good. The vibe and scenery wasn't super comforting but was nice place."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Ambience is lively and service is friendly. We got the creative coffee and it turned out ok. The coffee flavor didn't come through. However a 5 for a nice place to hang out.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Friendly staff, pretty latte designs and delicious avo toast. I am still shocked at how good it was. Definitely better than I expected and it lives up to the hype!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Loved loved loved the chocolate mint latte and the latte art on it. It was Totoro!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Best coffee in the neighborhood, perhaps even the Richmond. I am typically there for refills of their Ethiopia Yirgacheffe--it's the only bean I can consistently make a decent cup of joe with. In fact I love this coffee so much I bring it when I go on road trips, camping, etc because it's so damn good. That said I also get the sea salt and caramel latte on the treat yoself days. My wife who doesn't drink coffee loves the London Fog. Lastly and critical to a full Home experience, you gotta get those mochi donuts. Dank."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,This cafe is a great place to get a latte or tea and relax. The food is nicely prepared.  I recommend this place to all my friends that come in from out of town.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Very good quality and variety of coffee products. Want Ube iced coffee? They got you covered. Lavender flavor? Check! And, yes, the traditional lattes and expresso drinks are all available as well. Good space, although it is surprisingly small. This is a coffee place, so get your pastries somewhere in else."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"I love this place! Always come for a rainbow latte!  Service is great, though it is often hard to get a seat especially on the weekends. So many yummy flavors I have still yet to try!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,A bit out of the way but worth it for some delightful coffee. The put an interesting twist on all their creations. Get your latte and post it in the gram for that social currency. It is a hoot. I’m a simpleton who just gets an espresso though. Don’t judge.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"As we age, we can experience the feeling of every age we’ve ever been,  simultaneously. In this case 6 yo and old enough to pay for and appreciate this edible art. Thanks HCR…"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Love the coffee here. It is so adorable as well. Downside is the indoor serving is not available.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Incredible. Cute. Delicious. Amazing. One of my favorite coffee shops in SF by far (it comes 2nd to the Sunset location only because that was my first experience with Home Cafe and it was very magical).
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Used to love coming in to this coffee shop until today. I ordered Matcha Latte with Oatmilk. When I tried it, it tasted completely like cows milk. By the way, I am lactose intolerant. When I went back in, I told the kid working there that it tasted like cows milk and he said it wasn't. It was indeed oat milk. I didnt even get an answer to even remake it or anything. Of course, everyone was staring so it made the situation very uncomfortable. I have worked in customer service and understand that the customer should always leave satisfied. Today was just unprofessional. You just lost a customer."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,They've got cute stuff. The drinks are super cute. But it's a bit pricey for the toasts which are some things that can be made cheaply at home.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,My first time here and the rose latte was delicious. I loved being surprised with some kitty latte art as well!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,I love the creative coffees and how welcome and kind all of the employees are.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Always a nice spot to stop in, but service slows down pretty quick with even a small line.  Tasty and good presentation."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Amazing personalised service, remembered my name and order after only two visits. Coffee is the best tasting and presented I have had in the US."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Really great coffee and the nicest people working there!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Nice open floor plan cafe, and sorry I missed out on the patio seating. Staff is super enthusiastic and everyone has a smile. Great atmosphere and great drinks."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Delicious toasts & coffee! Really cute spot with beautiful food, fun place to grab food with friends!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"If you're looking for a place with a calm atmosphere and a good selection of drinks, this is the place.  The staff is amazing along with the layout/design of the place, the sign they place in front stating ""Welcome Home"" doesn't lie.  Just a few notes:  -Coffee here is good with a good selection, very well brewed and smooth. -Parking is street only but not too much an issue on weekdays, lots of meters. -Staff is amazing and welcoming -The toast is very tasty and on the light fair side.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a positive atmosphere place in the morning to chill out or a quick afternoon pick me up break from life."
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,This place has a great lattes and chai !! It’s a nice and cosy place with good ambience . They also have good breakfast toasts!!
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Do you know what a “fat Americano” is? Well, me neither, but it’s delicious!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Local coffee roasters. Prices fair average compared to other local coffee roasters. I shop here every now and then for their beans and they're really good.  Try their Richmons blend. Grinds depending on what you're using but it's really good.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"Pretty good place with good food, good and creative coffee and good people.  It can get pretty busy, so be prepared to have to wait for a table.  Everyone had a laptop out, so I'm guessing it's a very popular work spot and people are there for the long haul.  I got the Holy Cow and it was good.  Their toast is tasty, but a bit pricey in my opinion.  My partner got the Coke latte.  It was...interesting.  The server gave us his honest review, however, and described it as an ""acquired taste"". Very friendly and spot on!"
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,Cute place with some interesting drinks.
Home Coffee Roasters,2018 Clement St,"We came here for the Birthday Cake Lattes and they were GORG! Tasted great too! Great service! Highly recommend!  My favs:  Birthday Cake Latte, Matcha Latte, Cookie Monster, Lavender Latte"
