Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Great pastries and drinks but a bit costly for me. This location is nice though. Nice and clean, has lots of seats, and there's outdoor seats both under the entryway or out on the sidewalk/street. 4 ⭐'s for me!"
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,A VERY RACIST COFFEE SHOP. !! I wasted my time falling in line only to deliberately get ignored. A white lady and a man in coat came in and immediately greeted in. So insulting. How disappointing.
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,It's my first visit and i will be back! Very friendly staff and drinks were great!
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Friendly staff, good pumpkin spice latte, though a bit sweet for my taste. Nice atmosphere and has electrical outlets! But the wifi is pretty slow."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Love Peet's coffee.  Buy the beans for my home machines.  Had a latte, very good. Nice staff."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,Nice place service was good and fast. Thanks.
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Love it; coffee, service and atmosphere ... to mull over life, read or chat with a friend."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,They do have Sumatera coffee beans!
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,Good place to do work and study.
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"I love Peet's! They make a far far superior latte compared to SB & people are always friendly. Mellow atmosphere, quiet & calm. Clean bathrooms too, solid amount of workspace here considering how small it actually is. You can also buy bags of beans. Definitely stop in!"
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,Lovely staff and great coffee.
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,I wanted to give a shoutout to Chris this who greeted me with cheerfulness and positivity at 6am. I’ve encountered him at this location before and he always makes everyone feel special. I have a particular order and he was automate about getting it perfect. The world needs more people like Chris!
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,Super cozy little place. Great for just relaxing and drinking a warm cup of coffee.
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"First of all their coffee was not bitter!  The thing that really impressed me was how clean the entire store was.  The tabletops, cream and sugar station and most importantly the bathroom!  The the young man at the counter was professional yet friendly.  When I ask if Pete's still carried the citrus bread he responded, no sir I believe not but may I suggest the lemon pound cake, its excellent ""!  And he was correct.  I never liked the other guys coffee anyway, it is always better and Pete's is not!"
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,Peets is always my favorite place to go on Polk St for great espresso. Very tasty and nice location. Get errands done while buying good espresso beans!!
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"They were so rude, if they werent the only peets open I would've left the coffee there. We ordered online and of course they didnt put whipped cream on it but when I asked if they if I got the splenda right (as it's called something else online) he said ""your the one that ordered it did YOU get it right""? I was surprised at the lousy customer service compared to other peets."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"My experience reflects the morning staff as of 2018/05/19.  It's a very friendly group.  The staff is jubilant and helpful.  They also work pretty quickly and can get through the line fairly fast.  They usually have a good assortment of pastries and I've never had any issues with the drinks prepared here.  As far as getting work done: the seating is pretty good.  For me (male, 183cm), the wooden table is the right height to work on a laptop, but the wooden chairs are slightly uncomfortable.  On the flip side, the leather chairs are much more cozy, but tend to be relegated to the metal tables (which are slightly on the short side for me).  The reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is that the internet connection is ungodly slow.  I can usually pull between 100kbps and 200kbps, but occasionally not even that.  My LTE phone is faster, so I'll tether it when I need to do something like download a 20MB file.  Overall, I like this place.  It's my go-to when I'm on vacation and want to get personal work done."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"They've been burning a hole in my stomach with their super-rich dark roast for more than 20 years, and I wouldn't change a thing about the place. Thanks for brewing the best coffee on Russian Hill."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"We arrived at 7 - iy closes at 8 - yet there was no decaf and the counter intelligence wouldn't make fresh. She confused which coffee went into  whose travel mug. Then as we were sitting outsider til 745, she abruptly started sweeping around ur table til I asked her if she wanted us to leave.  She said it was 755.  We left, never to return. Peet's coffee is superior to all coffee, imo, but the counter intelligence needs an attitude adjustment. It seems to worsen with every week not only at this store but others."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"This story is nice as are the staff. I know it's my own Prejudice, but Pete's just never seemed as inviting as Starbucks."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,My usual place to go for coffee if you need a quick picker upper or enjoy a cup of latte.  Staff is friendly and they know your name.  Much better than the location in Stonestown.
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Delicious coffee (both espresso and cappuccino), fast and friendly staff. Have multiple locations in SF and all were goid"
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Here on a weekday. Nice neighborhood, good variety in seating options. A little dark inside but liked that there was no music. Great place to get work done."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"just got latte and egg and cheese sandwich.  drink had no protective tape on the lid nor the sandwich bag taped. sandwich was cold, latte tasted like someone never made one before. $25 for 2 items delivered."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"It's everything you expect out a Peet's. Knowledgable staff that make sure you're always doing well when you are working in the shop. WiFi is Free and fast. Peet's is offering a promotion for a free medium drink if you buy a $25 gift card. Peet's always does a great job in giving its customers a deal without trying to attain ""gold status"""
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"Comfortable seating area, excellent espresso-based drinks and a decent selection of baked goods. Peet's is not quite as corporate as the nearby Starbuck's and its lattes are much better."
Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"I don't drink coffee anymore, but I love going to Peet's because their tea menu is immaculate, and they take Android Pay which is usually faster than cash or credit card"

Peet's Coffee,54 W Portal Ave,"We had breakfast in this post not far from our hotel. I must say that with some doubts I tried the espresso and it wasn't bad at all! Strong but not burned. Good. The cappuccino is also well foamed which, like the rest of the café, you can choose in various sizes, always with a glass ""on the go"". Eventually it can be customized with cinnamon or cocoa powder. We also got muffins and cinnamon rolls. Good and fresh. Friendly staff especially the bearded guy!"
