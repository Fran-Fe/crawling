Bernie's,3966 24th St,"An absolute gem of a coffee shop, the most friendly and lovely staff, and damn good coffee. Super clean, welcoming and like something out of a beloved book. If you live in the area, you will make Bernie's yours; and if you are visiting, Bernie's will stay on your mind."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Randomly came in on a rainy afternoon for a pick me up and was impressed! Definitely the type of cafe that gets a lot of regulars. Another customer recommended the pecan bar and it was so good! Not too sweet with an amazing butter crust. Latte was good as well. More of a mild espresso flavor compared to other cafes. Will be back to try the scones!
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"There’s no atmosphere. Staff are masked and robotic. They won’t go near your cup from home, but they will take $4.50 in cash for a cup of poorly made coffee. Charged me $1 for regular milk, heated. A humbling and painful experience, like paying to be punched in the gut. Not my fetish."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Lovely little community coffee shop with extremely friendly baristas and staff. It must be managed by a caring and happy person who hires equally warm people. I had the chai late with oat milk and my husband had the plain iced coffee, both of which were delicious. They also have nice greenery in the front of the café now!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Bernie is friendly and nice and coffee is great. Sadly there's no seating inside, but usually a space in the bench outside."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Shockingly awful espresso, pulled incorrectly and extremely dark roast that tastes burnt. No wonder they ask you multiple times if you want sugar in the espresso."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"The perfect coffee shop for working, with patrons who reflect it. The tables are arranged for work, outlets are plentiful, and wifi is reasonable, or OK when it's crowded. Many students around here. The food is pretty good (got a burrito and a pumpkin cake), though more healthy options would be great.  The coffee shop is very stylish, as if reflecting the Noe vibe. Just the music was maybe too loud. The staff is very nice and chatty. The location is excellent, just run your errands and come do some work in the coffee shop."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"The atmosphere and vibe is great. I ordered a latte and the milk that was used was frothed beforehand and sitting in a large pitcher so my ""latte"" wasnt frothy at all. It was basically an espresso with warm milk. I also got a quiche. It was pricier a bit overpriced for the size but pretty good.  Tldr; It's a good place to camp out if you're not picky with your coffee, but if you care more, try somewhere else"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Bernie's is a great local coffee shop.  So much better than starbucks...friendly, cozy, local.    Great coffee and extras.  I love the breakfast burritos!  Support small businesses."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Super homey cafe with a wonderfully welcoming staff, and dope soy lattes. As a student, I appreciate the ability to camp out here in a sunny window and study away with some fun music in the background. Definitely one of my new go-tos in the city 😊 …"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"The loveliest little coffeeshop! The staff is super friendly and warm, and the atmosphere is great.  Love all the plants inside, and I notice there's always people outside on the benches sipping their coffee.  I got the Iced Bernie and it was delicious!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Adorable, but not much seating to speak of. It's certainly true that proximity to the Whole Foods is to their benefit, but it sort of kills the small neighborhood vibe outside the whole establishment. That's not a knock on the place, just an observation."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Just FYI to others that, as of April 2023, they still have no seating -- it's takeaway only still."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Very friendly service, chill vibe. Pleasant music. Has WiFi and a bathroom. Try ""the Bernie"" Americano."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Best coffee shop in San Francisco, hands down. Not only amazing coffee and quick bites, but the warmest welcome by Bernie and her staff, day after day, rain or shine."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,I love this place. Bernie is like the coffee Mama and truly has you feeling cared for and tended to when you step in the door. Coffee is good too!
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"What an amazing place, so cute full of plants and the coffee is delicious. It’s SF so coffee will always be expensive, but Bernie’s worth it!!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Hands down my favorite coffee place in Noe Valley.  Bernie (the owner) is an amazingly warm and caring person and all the baristas there are somehow maintain a cheery disposition, even despite the stressful work conditions these days.  They’ve taken covid seriously, and try to keep all their patrons safe.  And bonus... if you visit with your pup, they will often give your furry friend some treats!!  Keep up the amazing work, everyone!!  Toby and I love what you do!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Bernie's is quite possibly the best coffee place I've ever walked into. Not because of the coffee (that's a bonus) but because Bernie is just the kindest soul I've ever met. I'm incredibly grateful I got to live so close to her beautiful  haven for a  few years and miss it incredibly.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,The place itself is cute and I liked the service but unfortunately I really didn't like the coffee. I got a decaf cappuccino with oat milk and my sister got a regular cappuccino with whole milk. Neither of us enjoyed the coffee. They have benches outside too so if you don't mind the coffee it can be a cute place to sit and unwind.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Bernie's is the quintessential local coffee shop. World class coffee and Bernie and her staff are the warmest, caring coffee people anywhere!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,On my last day of a visit to San Francisco.  Had coffee here every morning.  I'm a Dunk's guy since I'm from Mass.  There was a Starbucks close by (gross) and I was happy to find this local place.  Coffee was excellent and the service even better.  Great atmosphere.  I have to leave for the airport at 5AM tomorrow and I am sad they won't be open yet.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"This is the best coffee shop I've ever been to. In quality of drink, food--of course. But above and beyond all that--in quality of staff, culture and Bernie as person.  I stopped by on the recommendation of a local friend, as I'm an out-of-towner. I needed a place to chill for a few hours before meeting up with family coming into town later. I ended up spending three hours watching a beautiful coterie of customers rotating in through her doors--all seemingly devoted regulars. She small talked about birthdays, children, and jobs, but it was more than small talk. Her conversation betrayed a personal intimacy that I simply don't see anymore.  Bernie instantly pulled me into this warmth. Not knowing me, she asked me about who I am, why I find myself in her shop, and spun me off delicately into other conversations with staff and regulars. I was pleasantly jolted by sociality of this wonderful shop, which was only rooted further by how delicious I found the coffee and pastries.  The only comparison that comes to mind is Phoebe Waller-Bridge's coffee shop in the second season of Fleabag. But this place exists.  Got me dreamin' of San Francisco. If you're a local--it should be obvious to skip the Starbucks on the corner and come here. But even if you just live anywhere in the Bay Area, you must make the trek to come check out this glittering diamond of a coffee shop."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"As a third generation San Franciscan, I can genuinely say that Bernie’s is as San Franciscan as it gets. Both she and her staff are welcoming and oh man is her coffee strong. As an over-worked teacher there are days when I would not make it through without a big cup of Bernie’s Blend. Don’t compromise and go to Starbucks (☹️) when right across the street you can get a vastly superior cup of coffee and support a local business woman at the same time"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Great, friendly vibe at this locally-owned coffee shop. I wish they offered a less-bitter variety of coffee for their espresso. It has tasted burnt the last two times I've been in :( Other than this, it is a good place to work from."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Thee best decaf in SF! Bernie memorizes everyone's favorite coffee drink for the whole neighborhood. Support local businesses in SF!
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Have known Bernidette for a long time. A cafe with history and ties to the community. And excellent coffee.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"I stopped by Bernie's earlier today and not only enjoyed a delicious espresso but also had the pleasure of chatting with Bernie! Her cafe is so warm and inviting - no wonder it's bustling every time I go there. But seriously, the coffee..... bruh, it's some next level brew!!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Bernie's is definitely where the Noe Valley locals hang out. The sun always shines on the benches out front, perfect for watching the action on 24th. The staff is friendly, the coffee is great, and they have a nice selection of pastries and wraps if you're hungry."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Nice little neighborhood coffee shop. Tasty and interesting selection  of pastries (including things like alfajores)and delicious coffee, rest room, photo decor, and a huge chalk board to amuse the kids. Very friendly staff who recognize regulars. A bench out front."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Great local shop, Bernie has been supporting the neighborhood for 16 years.   We need to support Bernie during these times as fewer people are going out to get there coffee. Please support our local shops."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Excellent neighborhood coffee shop on 24th Street right next to Whole Foods (convenient for taking a coffee to go while you do your grocery shopping). Super friendly service, comfortable seating, and high quality beans. They also compost and recycle in the store."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Bernie's looks like a normal, neighborhood cafe serving locals various espresso drinks and cafe fare.  A cursory glance and visit will likely result in a 4 or 5 star review that only scratches the surface of what 's inside.  I am here to provide a review of what this establishment really is.  The truth is, for the people of Noe Valley, Bernie's is not really a cafe at all.  People think they're coming here for coffee and pastries, but that honestly is not the case. Whether you order an iced beverage on a hot October day or are simply getting your daily Americano fix before work , the sensation of the caffeine will pale in comparison to what you'll feel.  The owner Bernadette ""Bernie"" and her handful of staff members dish out portions of comradery, friendship, and some much-appreciated warmth for the community.  They seem to know everyone to the point you'd think they all grew up together.  Their genuine interest in how you are doing is nothing short of touching.  Regulars can't help but walk out of Bernie's with lifted spirits and everything they prepare is seasoned with a feeling of ""everything's going to be okay."" At this point, I don't even know what my order is or how much it costs because the reality is that it doesn't matter.  For most of us the order itself is inconsequential.  Bernie's isnt a cafe.  For many, it is a community hub. A mini town hall. A backyard barbecue.  A small dinner party. A slow walk with an old friend. A home.  I can't say enough how comforting it has been having this place during what are otherwise fairly overwhelming times.  If you haven't been, I encourage you to try it out.  You'll be happier that you did."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"I have been a Bernie's customer since the beginning and have yet to be disappointed in any way. Wonderful coffee and tea, pleasent surroundings, and the warmest, most attentative, and well trained staff that makes it a pleasure to start my day here.  Thanks Bernie!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Extremely great coffee and an even better staff. For someone visiting from down under the latte here was exactly likethe flat whites back home
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Nice little neighborhood coffee shop, but they don't serve Tullys Coffee like it says in the description. That's a disappointment, because Tully's is excellent. The biscottis are very tasty though, so that's a redeeming quality."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Great service and super friendly staff. Always greeted warmly here. Coffee is pretty good too. They also open super early during the week (5:15am).
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Nice friendly coffee shop in an idyllic neighborhood Decent amount of seating I haven't been there since my last trip to SF but they were kinda short on outlets to plug computers in However with a name like Bernie's what's not to love? :)
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Very friendly shop with great service. Nice place to hang out, and lots of tasty treats. I especially love the banana nut muffins, and the carrot-ginger muffins are also very good."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Bernie's is my go-to spot when I'm in the mood for something with a casual neighborhood ambiance -- it's a great place to meet up to chat with a friend, or just to chill out with a book. I also am totally hooked on their maple lattes which I have not found anywhere else!"
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"This is my local coffee shop. I wish their coffee was better. I go there because i like the 2 big chairs, the service is good and it's very chill and relaxed. Their chai is not good though. I get tea instead."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,We were so excited to find a local coffee shop and this place did not disappoint! The mushroom and gorgonzola empenada was amazing.  Hope to be back before the end of our trip!
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Couldn’t get through the newborn stage without Bernie’s Coffee. Absolutely delicious and great attitude and a great way to start the day.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Great neighborhood coffee shop.  If I want an amazing macchiato I'd make the trek down to Ritual instead, but for a quick cup of coffee or espresso drink, it's my pick in the neighborhood."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Cappuccino so poorly made, and so expensive that it’s offensive. Lovely place to sit otherwise, but I just don’t understand why anyone would accept cappuccino with bubbles so large it could pass as dishwashing refuse."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"A terrific oat latte, classic soul music at a relaxed volume, and the crowd wasn’t noisy. A great cafe on a rainy morning."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,My favorite place to get a great cup of coffee (sometimes iced) or a mocha with a side of joy and pleasant conversation with the owner and staff.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,More of a community than a coffee shop because of the friendly nature of the people who work there. The coffee is great too!
Bernie's,3966 24th St,"Pros: really friend staff, not too crowded, somewhat heated in winter. Cons: awful espresso, really loud machine, very slow wifi, very dirty bathroom."
Bernie's,3966 24th St,Bernie is a national treasure and the unofficial ambassador of Noe Valley. Wonderful atmosphere and great place to hang out. Authentic noe valley.
Bernie's,3966 24th St,The best staff and products.  The owner is a true person that cares about her clients.  Other places can learn a lot from the way this place operates and always treats the customers Right.
