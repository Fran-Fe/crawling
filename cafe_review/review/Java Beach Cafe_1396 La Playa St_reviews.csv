Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A neighborhood place. Opens really early for breakfast and I love it. Location is great, right across from the zoo. No competitors around. The service was nice, and they offered many varieties. We had  breakfast here, plain oatmeal and bagel & cheese. Decent food!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is a great location to grab and go to the beach or just chill inside. I got the tsunami, it was good, filling and tasty. In addition i got the iced vanilla bean latte and it was creamy and tasty. I would come back!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Long line, but it moved quickly. Great salmon bagels and snacks! Butterscotch latte is excellent."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Good food. Good coffee. Good service. Clean restroom. Great location near the beach and zoo.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Got the pesto turkey wrap. It was good.  Java Beach Cafe is a pretty relaxed and chill lunch spot.  Only complaint is that I don't think they have enough bathrooms for how people eat there.  Also, not their fault, but there was this homeless dude yelling and pacing around the cafe outdoor seating.  Kinda killed the vibe a little."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I got a delivery of the blt with chicken and man is it good. It is a double decker sandwich made with love. The chicken blends amazing with the bacon and avocado. The mayonnaise is not overpowering and just adds a bit of texture to the sandwich.  The bread was a bit stale and the chips were alright. Overall amazing sandwich with ingredients that blends well with eachother.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Nice beachfront coffee shop with a casual vibe and tons of outdoor seating, well positioned for great people watching. Large selection of beverages, including many options for coffees and teas. Good selection of food options for breakfast or lunch, including tasty breakfast burritos. Quite busy on nice weekend days with a constant line."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Friendly staff, decent but not premium coffee. Open super early which is great for early birds"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Nice coffee shop with a friendly staff. This was the meet up spot for a Photowalk and they were very welcoming to a large group of people being there. Coffee was well priced and I did not expect that. Great coffee, great price, friendly staff, and nice view."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Super cute place, amazing location, great coffee, great food, and friendly service. I literally couldn’t ask for more if I tried! I tried a hummus & veggie bagel and it was delicious and refreshing, perfect fare before a short walk across the street to the beach. If you’re looking for a little relaxation, I can’t recommend this enough."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Cute cafe on the coast. Not much seating inside which is an issue at peak times when it’s chilly or wet. Fantastic selection of sandwiches, subs, and pastries. The Bonfire Delight roast beef sub was exceptional 👌 …"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"drinks, food all was good! Very packed, wait time could be longer that average but was worth the wait. Espresso, cappuccino and butterscotch latte all was nice, also they offer variety of non dairy milk. sandwiches, wraps - all tasted freshly made and delicious! nice beach coffee shop"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,My go-to coffee shop in the sunset neighborhood. The staff is incredibly nice and friendly. They have everything from bagels over croissants to hot sandwiches. The turkey sub is my favorite!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This little gem of a coffee shop / Cafe is across the street from the zoo but there is another one down the road a bit on la playa! they have wonderful coffee , fresh Irish soda bread ,croissants both plain and stuffed, Sammie, bagels , and the standard type fare you would expect at a Beachside Cafe. prices are moderate - inexpensive for SF &  the location. there are plenty of outlets and power strips available to plug in your laptop while you're writing your alleged screenplay or novel and they do provide bins for composting, recycling and reusable cups and silverware so you aren't wasting any plastic unless you really want to. I sometimes end up here after my morning swim and it is always delightful. The staff is always quite friendly. Ada accessible entrances and bathrooms make this tops in my book for an easy meet up place. Non binary bathrooms too. highly recommend!!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Friendly staff with a 25 minute wait (which we were notified of after we ordered) on a Saturday morning.  For two, we shared the Bonfire Delight roast beef sandwich with avo added and a bowl of tomato garlic soup.  Both were delicious and we will go back. One star off because we weren’t notified before paying of the wait and would have likely gone to a different place."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The veggie breakfast burrito is great. Lightly grilled to finish it off.  The Java club sandwich was epic, perfect sourdough toast."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I consider this a San Francisco staple.  it's by the beach, super convenient and there's lots of outside dining as well as inside. it's cute it's comfy it's cozy and they have coffee."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,They really do make a great sandwich. I got the java club with turkey and a side of their spicy coleslaw— which really does have a kick! The outdoor seating is also very nice but just a heads up if you are going on a Sunday around peak lunch time hours then you’ll end up having to wait 20 minutes or so to get your food.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,This is a nice coffee shop by the beach. The staff are friendly. The coffee is tasty. Not a lot of GF options.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I’m seriously at a loss for how this place is still in business. It’s in a great location, it has a really cute patio, but the worst prices and the most average food you could imagine.  Pictured below is what amounts to just over $20. $13.50 for a subpar sandwich, $3.05 for garbage coffee, $4 for one of the worst spinach croissants I’ve ever had, and the rude, entitled service? Priceless.  You could be doing so much better, but your staff is downright awful. It took over 45 minutes to bring out a sandwich, a croissant, and 3 bagels. There aren’t any trash, recycling, or compost bins. It wasn’t busy, and you have a half menu right now. You all still have jobs! You have no excuse to be so salty right now."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Nice cafe near Ocean beach. Very busy place though. I was standing in the line for almost 15-20 mins. Lot of drink and food choices on the menu. There is seating outside and inside. Latte was pretty good. Very popular place.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Fantastic service, attentive and polite servers, lovely atmosphere, and free Wi-Fi! What more could you ask for?! Thanks so much, Java Beach Cafe!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"You won’t find a better place to just sit back take a sip of your coffee, get a sandwich & some cold slaw & listen to the waves of the ocean! thats what i had, except the coffee, i’ll get it next time, but i did order a sandwich & you choice between chips or cold slaw as a side all under $10! Can you believe that! plus my sandwich had tons of roast beef! plus the cold slaw was enough to get full, & i just ordered half a sandwich! The girl behind the counter was super friendly, overall you won’t regret coming to this cafe right next to Ocean Beach. I also noticed they sell bagels & pastries gotta try that next time i come back to this place! Highly recommend this place if your ever hungry & are looking for lunch at the beach!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Nice place, by the ocean after a walk or a bike ride. Good options for salads, sandwiches and bagels. A number of vegan options are available. Coffee is available. It could get crowded so not ideal for working on a laptop although you may find some people doing that. Only concern would be cleaniness of the tables and the floor but this is mostly related to the crowdiness of the place."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is a great little cafe. I was in San Francisco for a few days and this was a walking distance from my hotel and also from the trolley stop. The coffee is absolutely amazing and it kept me coming back every single morning before we headed out for our day of sightseeing! In addition to the delicious coffee, their food menu offers an excellent variety of sandwiches, bagels and pastries. I highly recommend!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Always delicious food, lattes, and hard working staff! This place is a great breakfast stop to fuel up before a day at the beach or in Golden Gate Park"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"food and drinks are absolutely incredible. cannot be topped. i’m from colorado and came to visit san francisco and was recommended java beach and it did not disappoint!! i had an iced butterscotch latte with soy milk and the flavor was absolutely amazing. i also had a hummus veggie wheat bagel and it tasted so fresh and the hummus was to die for. only complaint about the restaurant is the interior could use a little refresher, but it was still an enjoyable experience! going to miss this when i return home. thanks again :)"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Very nice little cafe that serves coffee in the morning and beer in the afternoon and evening. The little train layout behind the bar is a unique and nice touch to the place.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,All the great coffee shop options! Would return. Perfect place to stop as you stroll along the beach.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Used to be my canteen and still is when visiting the town. Just grabbing an iced coffee, crossing the street and facing the Pacific ocean, your thoughts and dreams is a therapy in itself. Warmly recommend."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I had an egg sandwich with sausage which was a lil pricey but very delicious. The line was long but the food comes out fast.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I’ve loved this place for many years and even more so now during the pandemic. I appreciated all of the Covid precautions in place and the kind reminders to those not observing them. Ordering through the website was a breeze and the food and coffee was amazing as always. I got the vegetarian breakfast burrito and a café au lait.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Delicious coffee, vanilla latte made with real vanilla bean 🤩 the baristas are very nice and the location is right by the beach. They also have a bathroom for their customers which is super nice in SF.  Some good pastries available as well."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Used to absolutely love this place - chill casual spot across the street from the ocean. But I’ve noticed that the bathroom is gradually dirtier over the years and the staff could improve on being more friendly and/or helpful. Still a great place to grab a coffee and quick bite. But definitely room for improvement.  Instagram: @thenomadicfoodie
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Ordered some food, waited an hour because my order wasn't called and turns out someone took my order. They didn't do anything to fix it besides say sorry. Felt like they were super condescending about the situation."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A great way to start your day if it's not too earlier or you're not in much of a hurry. The line can be long, especially on the weekend, but the coffee drinks and nibbles are well worth the wait!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I usually don’t leave reviews but I ordered a bacon egg and cheese burrito and it was super cold and super small and also don’t let me forget to tell you it was $10 for something that fits in my palm
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Total surfer’s cafe! Such a great spot for any warm beverage, but also have great food and snacks!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Java Beach Café is my absolutely favorite place on the Westside! It's an example of a good Café. Excellent service, awesome taste of everything I tried from the menu, reasonable prices, cozy interior and great atmosphere. The oatmeal, bagels, croissants and loaf toasts are all good, but my favorite breakfast there was Java Club with coleslaw and tripple shot of mocha. Highly appreciated and recommend!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,The sandwich was filling while I really wasn’t super hungry for once while I was eating it. I had been really craving deli sandwiches during the week and the Java Beach Café sandwich was satisfying.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Cute place! I took home lots of pastries,  I highly recommend them all."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great sandwiches, rich coffee, and the most beautiful barista in California. Plus, you can walk 60 seconds to enjoy their wares on the beach"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Just waited almost a full hour for an overpriced laughably TINY bite of quiche to go. I thought maybe they had to go find the chickens to lay the eggs. Jokes aside the place had a lot of staff, hardly any customers in the restaurant had food so I'm not really sure what the hold up was. At most cafes this dish could be prepared in less than 10 minutes even with a restaurant full of customers eating meals. Won't be coming here again!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great people watching, and so close to the beach. I meet my friends for coffee here. The N Judah drops off right there."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Cool corner spot by the beach. Good coffee friendly staff
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Perfect for breakfast at the beach. Don’t forget to grab a chocolate chip cookie too.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Changed my rating because of changes to cafe. I like(d) the funky atmosphere [not as good anymore] Single pours very good but not exceptional. [I don’t think they do pour overs anymore] [Drip coffee average at best] Often difficult to find a seat with quite a few people glued in place on laptops. [Removed some inside seating] Some outside seating [added more], but this is SF and near the beach so dress warmly"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great atmosphere and food. I would come back again!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,A very nice place! Stopped for lunch and was able to get a great sandwich at a decent price! The outdoor eating area was perfect for our dogs.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Best sandwiches in the city. Whatever bread they are using it's so delicious. Keep in mind there is always a line there. Highly recommend you go. Its walking distance to the beach. Also noisy since there is N line right next to it.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Old school coffee ‘shack’ at the end of the Muni line at Ocean Beach. A nice atmosphere and staff, WiFi, and although I couldn’t see it on the menu, they serve beer, at least in the evenings in funny glass jars."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A little expensive, java club sandwich was good, coffee is good if your looking for generic coffee, breakfeast sandwich with sausage was like a $3 mcdonalds sausage mcmuffin but for $6.50. There is no fancy drinks here was hoping for a delicous frappe style drink like starbucks but no luck here. Biggest benefit is their near the ocean and a nice outside sitting area."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Delicious food a short walk from Golden Gate Park and the beach. Friendly staff, no table service. Good spot to keep out of the wind. Vegan options available."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Quite quick and friendly service. Got coffee tea and a breakfast burrito within a few minutes, very hot very tasty. This is one of our go-to places whenever we're in town and should be yours as well."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Glad we discovered this beautiful cafe! Bagels were as delicious as coffee! The live music (informal, not guaranteed) was fantastic!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Quick service and friendly staff. Just across the street from the beach. Great coffee. Got an asiago bagel and it was full-flavored.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I come here a lot when I’m staying in SF. Good service and good coffee. I like trying all the pastries too.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I always wanted to stop in and check this place out but never had the nerve to ""just do it."" Today, I Had an itch for something different.....something with a local flare. I wanted to grab a coffee and just go, but when i walked it....it gave me the impression and feeling of a ""side-bar."" (If you dont know what a side-bar is, you havent been bar hopin like i have.)"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"It was really nice place, people peaceful a chili, good sandwiches so are expensive"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A lovely little cafe with so many breakfast options, parking at this place is a little tricky. When you search for a seaside breakfast place, it comes on top but doesn't expect a beach or sea view from here. Sea is a little far away, and you can reach it by crossing two streets and a little hike. However, a nice place to have breakfast 🍳"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great spot by the beach! Super convenient for grabbing a quick coffee or delicious warm bagel. There's also a ton of birds around this spot which makes for a very unique atmosphere. Highly recommend stopping by this place if you're in the area even if you just want to stop by and see the birds
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Amazing Bagels, Nice Environment, Friendly Employees. We will come back…"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Coffee and breakfast sandwich were tolerable but unimpressive at their price point. The cashier was unnervingly rude to my sister who was visiting her first time. There was an obvious preference and change in demeanor towards their regulars. I was a barista for many years, they’re not doing it right at this cafe. I don’t feel inclined to return."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This great little Cafe is at the end of the N Judah Muni Metro line right by Ocean Beach. They have really good coffee and a lot of tasty food offerings. Nice outdoor dining area. Very rustic and friendly. Highly recommended. Great place to meet friends who live way out in the Avenues, or as a stop on the way to the beach if you are using Muni Metro to get to the beach."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Wouldn't serve coffee or food due to event yet they call themselves a business.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"You can only stay for 45 minutes and will be asked to leave as soon as you’ve eaten whatever you had. Not a good place for breakfast in our opinion. Our bagels were very disappointing (way too much cream cheese, old tomato, too much raw onion), for quite a steep price. I wish we would have loved this place as much as everyone else, but at least for breakfast, I wouldn’t do it again. Maybe to grab some coffee on the go."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,It was a nice place. The foods taste was delicious but the breakfast burrito portion was small. The parfait was delicious. The blt was great. All well made good. Small area but a good sit and relaxing spot.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Ah, my local coffee shop. Their prices are, to be quite frank, a tad ridiculous, but the eats and drinks on offer are always of good quality. Grabbing a coffee and plopping down in the outdoor seating is always enjoyable on a sunny Outer Sunset day."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is a must stop if you dig local coffee shops. Coffee was awesome good and they have a great selection of eats- muffins, sandwiches, beer. All good."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The Java Beach Cafe is the place to get a coffee and pastry on the way to the ocean. Currently, the cafe is allowing one customer at a time to come inside and to order only. The pick-up window is right outside the cafe patio area."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Love Java Beach on Judah! Always good (Irish soda bread with housemate jam) coffee drinks. Suggest staying away from their ""toast"" though! Literally slice of thin store bought bread with scant topping. Folks are laid back and it always ""feels good"" to visit."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Amazing sandwich. It’s worth the price because it’s really big. The coffee is really good as well. The staff here are really nice!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Some of the best cold brew. Toffee, caramel, vanilla hints. Total surf vibe. Perfect!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Slightly disappointing. The hot subs were really greasy. The avocado on my sub was also not necessarily fresh. I would not go back.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"After a long day of touring San Francisco, we ended up nearby and needed a pick me up.  On a Sunday afternoon, the café was packed and busy.  We just ordered some drinks for the road. I had an Iced Almond Milk Latte, and it was good. The espresso was good but unfortunately wasn't strong enough for me. Should have added an extra shot.  Service is good.  Prices were reasonable.  Great neighborhood spot!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Cool little place.  Sandwiches were good.  Location is great.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"It's overpriced. I don't live here anymore, but I spent 25 years in SF, and I remember when Java Beach was a friendly, affordable neighborhood cafe. Unfortunately it has gotten careless in evaluating its customer base, because now it seems to be catering only to a well-off crowd instead of the lower and middle-class folks comprising much of the Sunset. I felt I'll at ease when I was there, and I wonder, did some corporation buy it or something? It's too bad that such a well-loved business from the past has jumped aboard the gentrification train. A very sad loss for the Sunset District."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,This hidden gem happened to be close to our hotel. The bagles and burritos were both delicious. And the coffee was just what the soul ordered on a brisk morning. Definitely check it out.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I ordered a sandwich to stay and was told to wait at the pickup window. I waited for 10-15 minutes and then after checking with the staff it turned out the sandwich was just sitting on a bench inside the place. They apologized and said this happens sometimes.  They really need a better system or better staff training.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Went here today with my roommates to study and had the worst experience. Me and my roommates were the only people of color there and we were watched the entire time. Every time a worker walked past us they would go out of their way to glare at us. I was very excited to take my roommates here as I've had great experiences here in the past, however, I have never felt so uncomfortable. We were very respectful and nice to all the workers and were still treated so poorly. Will not be going back, unfortunately. How we were made to feel is not ok.  Update: The owner reached out and was extremely apologetic and willing to understand what happened. They gave me and my roommates a refund and said they’d get to the bottom of what happened!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Loved the curry chicken wrap & cappuccino! My father and my fiance both had the bacon breakfast burrito & enjoyed it so much they want to come back every time we are in the area! Love the vibes, the workers are very nice and the spot is gorgeous not far from the sand dunes and ocean."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I’ve been going to Java Beach Cafe since they opened and they have only gotten better and better over the years. They have a decent selection of grubby beach food, hot and cold sub sandwiches and the breakfast wraps and soups are always really good. Oh yeah, the soft serve ice cream is a big hit too! Gabby, Santana, Belle, Eva, Vanessa and all of the cheery Irish ladies that work here are all just wonderful!!! They really care about every customer being happy with their orders, and on the rare occasion that something is off, they will gladly take care of it and make it right with no questions asked. I’ve seen Belle, Gabby and Santana all go well above and beyond for myself and other customers, (children and adults alike), while they are working, they always have a great attitude, and they are always very kind to everyone."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Outstanding sandwiches and coffee - I’ve literally never had anything here that was less than excellent. Great place for people watching too.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Love.  The sun dried tomato cream cheese in a sesame toasted bagel, and latte hit the spot.  4 stars only for not leaving the veggies off my bagel order , but they were easy to take off (just didn’t want to juggle those while walking).  Easy enough to take of the lettuce, will change to 5 the customer service is great."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Omg, I had The BEST Chai Tea here. Staff was friendly and pleasant."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Perfect spot, fantastic coffee and pastries. Please support this business and have a walk by the beach!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Salad was good, but was incidentally there on earth day, and couldn’t help but notice there was no compost or recycling bins for waste. Trash bins for everything, which is not that cool. Hope this restaurant improves its waste management, for the sake of our one earth and all."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great coffee, excellent service, nice outdoor seating area. Very convenient to the beach. We got coffee here every morning during our visit to the city."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I love their vanilla bean latte! Everyone is so friendly at this cafe!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The food was fine, but I was surprised about the service.  I asked for a burrito to be cut in half, and it became a chore.  I then had to wait 24 minutes for 2 coffees, two bagels, and a burrito.  I was just a bit surprising.  Oh, and the bagel had all its ingredients on one side.  It was just odd.  The whole experience required me to hold their hands through the whole order and I wasn’t aware of that."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great place to pick up a snack while hiking on or near Ocean Beach. Amazing BLT and club sandwiches and fresh espresso or coffee. Take it with you for a picnic or just eat there.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Very average. I waited quite awhile for my order, I saw people who ordered after me get their food and drinks. Eventually I went in and the guy checked the take out window, my order had just been sitting there. No receipt no name. The food was not very good also. The kale Caesar was drenched with dressing, the french roll wasn’t good at all. Anyway, this place does not deserve a 4.4 star review"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Simple and delicious
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Very friendly staff , delicious food and great location.. the pictures represent the location 😅 …"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,One of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. Staff are efficient and very pleasant. Very fair prices.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Nice chill cafe near to the beach. This cafe is your typical Ocean beach cafe: Chill and relaxing, not very fancy but with a unique look.  Ordered coffee which was pretty decent.  Staff was very courteous and helpful.   There is also life music in the late afternoons and nights, but they take a substantial part of the cafe space."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Delicious,  great service, live music, near from the beach, what else do you want?"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Fresh, quick sandwiches and excellent coffee. I was pleasantly surprised by a recent visit. The veggie sandwich is massive with dust the right crunch. The slaw was bright and acidic. And starting that off with a beautifully made raised glazed donut was the perfect treat."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,A little neighborhood coffee shop by the beach. There are lots of seats inside and 2-3 outdoor tables.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Drove out to the beach to check it out.   Place looked great.  Ambiance was nice. Live music! Great beer selection!  The vegetarian sandwich looked uninspired.  Those...  we have all these the toppings and garnishes for our meat sandwiches so lets put them on bread for the vegetarians - no protein - kind of sandwiches.  I'm glad they had the options, but I'm glad we went somewhere else."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"One of my favorite cafes to hang out at after walking around the park or just to get some work done. Some nights (Saturday I believe) they have live music which is pretty cool.  I’ll be honest - the coffee is good but nothing special. I come here mostly because they also serve beer and the food is good. So makes for a great work/study spot. The vibe by the beach also makes it nice, which is why it still earns 5 starts."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,This place is amazing. So close to the beach you can hear the waves from the patio. The sandwiches are made fresh to order and are some of the best in the Sunset. The staff is always friendly. Food and drinks are cheap. Great place to meet a friend for a beer or come to read/study.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Coffee was otherworldly. Bagel selection was entirely off the chain. The kinda staff that you just wanna hug until their eyes pop outta their head. Outdoor seating available so you can take in the sights and sounds of the street. Steps away from the ocean. What I'm tryna tell ya is that Java Beach is that spot, dig?"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Awesome plane for a quick bite. Great coffee, donuts, breakfast sandwiches and burritos. Staff was very friendly."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This store is a not-so-hidden treasure in the middle of this urban jungle. Especially at night! Open until 11pm- wow! Saved me from my scary motel, and made my trip! Thanks for being open so late! The tomato-pesto-cheese sandwich was portioned HUGE - in a great way- and I was thoroughly impressed by not only portions, but your great service from your employees. After staying at a unfortunate motel down the street, this little cafe gave my friends and I hope for our trip. The staff were extremely polite and helpful from the minute we walked in with only an hour until close.. Fast wifi and overall a great vibe. Even other customers were friendly. Cute, unexpectedly hipster, and a great experience. - One thing I'd like to mention- it may be helpful if there were a way to space out the tables an inch or two more for connivence when getting up to refill water cups, get napkins, etc. - Thank you! Love the place!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is a great place to be productive while enjoying good food. The soups are all decent, especially the Chicken Coconut Curry. Great sandwiches and other, healthier options as well (their granola is yummy).  It gets pretty crowded on sunny days, though, so sometimes there isn't room inside and the wait can be a bit long."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Live a few blocks away and have been many times. Have to unfortunately give a public 1-star to Java Beach for bullying another small business Kahve coffee off of the Great Walkway. Thanks to SFChron for exposing this, I won’t be supporting this biz and would encourage others to consider other local Sunset businesses that are more community minded."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"First time here and wasn't impressed at all.  Overpriced basic food. No staff communication about where customers are waiting. They're calling out names outside for people inside and vice versa which caused so much confusion. Dirty tables and had to ask to have the table cleaned. Some of the staff don't change their gloves or  wash their hands. Gloves are 1 time use and there needs to be education on that. They were using the SAME gloves to clean, handle boxes, deal with customers' food, make drinks,  etc. So gross! I don't know how they're still open or following COVID guidelines appropriately."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"One of the things I miss most about living out in sunset was getting the chance to walk over to Java Beach cafe for a warm drink and a good meal. When my best friend from the east coast visited me, this was the first place she ate at and she couldn't believe how FRESH the veggies were and how good quality the food was. They've got a lot of good stuff and it's RIGHT NEXT to the beach (so be prepared for the wind!)."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This place is a bit crowded, and for good reason. The atmosphere is excellent, the location is second to none, they have tables of distressed wood and a very nice and sunny patio. An excellent place to sit by the beach with refreshments. They also have many kinds of coffee and tea, and light sandwiches."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Cozy Cafe by the beach. Nice selection of coffee shop items, including salads. Reasonably priced. Serves alcohol too. Always friendly people behind the counter. Nice vibes.... Live music too at times, outside seating, and great sunsets close by (when the weather is right - when not cuddle inside on the wood benches and have a hearty soup)"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"My friend and I ate breakfast here (after it being recommended to us by a local lady) on a Saturday morning and we enjoyed it very much. To eat I ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich with the everything bagel. At first glance the bagel was smaller than expected, but the taste was absolutely excellent. Really fresh ingredients, and delicious. Strangely, our drinks (cappuccino and a mocha) took a really long time to be made. We were both nearly finished with our food before the drinks were ready. This was a minor thing though in the grand scheme of things and we would happily eat there again any time. We can also vouch for their fruit bowl, oatmeal, and croissant."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,It’s a great cafe by the beach with delicious breakfast and lunch options but they’re even good for dinner...They’re generous with the ingredients and have. A homemade coleslaw that is good and light. Not very creamy with a twist of poppy seeds added. It’s quite good. If your lucky enough try the pies! The blueberry warmed up with the whip on the side is delicious.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Even though the little chilly it was worth the wait for the sandwich that sandwich was delicious and it's right by the San Francisco beach
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Super aesthetic shop with a decently long line especially if you're going on the weekend. The sandwiches were delicious and the food came out pretty fast. However, one of the hot sandwiches we ordered took a while to come out"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The location is beautiful being right on the beach, however the place is a bit pricey for your local cafè that pretty much just has the basics. Seating can also be very limited and not many places for people to charge their laptop. The coffee is excellent and staff friendly."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Friendly staff (one can't remember her name, but pleasant and helpful), good coffee and snack (bagel). Before heading to the coast. Only issue was fighting dodging the birds poo while there was a crowd of them in the trees, sitting on the patio area (inside closed) (possibly to be expected with outside). Otherwise fair. If that way again, will stop by. 😊"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Awesome food!  The blueberry bagel is the best I've ever had.  The Popeye salad is also phenomenal.  The staff are friendly and the wifi works well.  It's always a little crowded, but the clientele are all very nice folks."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Typically very busy, but luckily not on my last visit. Expect a decent wait for food or ordering but good value once your order is ready. Sandwiches are big and may be best if shared with someone else (unless you're really hungry)."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,one of my favorite little cafes! they’re having outdoor seating during covid which is great. the hummus vegetable wrap is delicious - i highly recommend. i love the ocean/sunset district vibe.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"You order at the counter and you pick up your food at the far end, so you kind of have to pay attention because they didn't call my name but called out my order and I didn't even hear them.  I got the grilled cheese here which was good and extremely filling. The coffee is nice and strong.  If you see a table, grab it, this place is busy even at 3:30 pm on a Sunday."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Cute lil corner cafe, with a good selection of coffee, sandwiches, salads, and soups. Pastries are good as well. It gets very busy however, so seating is limited. Usually a wait for your coffee of about 5-15min. (depending on the crowd). I love this place. Very convenient within the neighborhood."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great breakfast selection and the sandwiches are amazing as well! It's all about the Java and sandwiches here! Have some tasty soft serve as well. Just wish that some of the staff didn't have a chip on their shoulder. It's a coffee shop, but in this location the loss of the ""holier than thou"" attitude could mean a lot more $$$ for this great find."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Good food and drink, had the chai tea. Friendly staff, not much indoor seating."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Visit a couple times a month. It's a great cafe with a good range of baked goods, bagels and sandwiches.  Occasionally there is a local artist playing music in the corner. Check the schedule and plan ahead a bit so you don't have to get interrupted to move.  Being close to the beach, there can be quite a few vagrants. The staff is very mindful and no one has ever been violent that I've seen.  Also, please don't be the person that sits for hours and only buys one coffee and takes up an entire area. It's very inconsiderate of the business and rude, this isn't a Starbucks."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Could I give a minus star I would. Worst breakfast experience ever: unfriendly bored and unmotivated staff.  The bagels were burnt in the first run, the second run still very dark. Topping of the bagels cannot be described. We could not really eat what we were served.  Coffee... that was the only thing that was not below average but only average. If you do not have to go - do not go."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Good coffee and sandwiches. You can even grab a beer! Expect a little bit of a wait for a seat if you are with others and want to sit together. If on your own, don't be afraid to ask a stranger if the seat across from them is taken. Great atmosphere."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great range of teas and so nice to get the tea and then walk on the beach. Great prices and good food too. The servers are lovely and I always feel welcomed there. Take cash or card. Free wifi and people always studying in there. Good outdoor seating too !
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Good place to get coffee. Very casual environment. All locations I’ve ever been to have a bohemian type of feel to them. All female staff. Stones throw from the beach.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The place has charm.  Has wifi.  They don't make your cafe late, but they'll give you a cup with coffee and provide you with milk to put in it.  They have nice sandwiches, but they're not cheap (though in line with such prices in other places in San Francisco).  They have some outdoor tables and chairs."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"First time at the Java Beach Cafe. I went to meet a friend I hadn't seen in years. Great ambiance, coffee, sandwiches, and friendly staff."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Friendly place with good coffee. Lots of people on laptops working (though not as many outlets as you'd like) which means open seating can be tight. Nice looking pastries and breads, with a particularly impressive selection of muffins."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Really friendly service. People are staying here for hours so you might not find a seat. Food is good but treats are pricey!! 5$ for a cookie? But the bun are HUGE = 2 portions
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Super cute little cafe near the beach, with prominent surfer vibes. I read a review on foursquare that said this was the place to get hot chocolate in the sunset, but the one I received was a bit lackluster (and took quite a bit of time), especially for the price. It seems like a nice place though, and I'll definitely be back to try something else."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The cafe at the end of the N Judah, across the street from the Pacific Ocean, in a neighborhood that feels more like a beach town than anywhere else in San Francisco. In better times, it's a place to have a coffee and breakfast, or lunch and a beer, and chill for hours. But even in this pandemic, it's a nice place to get sandwiches to bring to the beach. The staff is doing more than their part to keep the neighborhood alive, so remember pandemic tipping is at least 25%."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Hippie cafe, serves both food and coffee,  medium vibes, nice small terrace/seating. Servants were kind of struggling, but not to the point of making me disappointed. Very close to the beach and golden state park. Ideal if you can work remotely, start your day with a walk in the park, work and then call it a day with a Sunset gazing and then take the famous cable car to Downtown. Just beware, it can get too windy to walk on the beach or sit in the terrace"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Super dog-friendly! They have water bowls out front for your dog to drink out of. You can sit with your dog outside as well :) Food was delicious and staff was really nice
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I was near the beach, and really needed some grub, thanks for the large sub.  They have a bunch of options for subs (I got a roast beef with cheddar and a bunch of other toppings and it was delicious). Seating was a problem (no tables available on a weekend afternoon), unless you wanted to sit outside. Sitting outside was a problem, unless you wanted send any loose napkins or bags swirling away in the ferocious ocean beach winds (they still manage to reach across the dunes). I believe they serve coffee, too."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A nice, cozy and communicating place that offers quality product in a very easy going atmosphere. One little important detail, though: A very dry cappuccino takes time and should not be close to a latte; the young man preparing my java drink does not seem to know the difference and refused to accept my suggestion. A far cry from my previous cappuccino prepared by a very skilled lady just a couple of days before."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great sandwiches. Really friendly staff. Unfortunately can't say the same for some of the patrons. A chilled place for sure. But one person, one cup of coffee, a table for 6,  there for over an hour. Not cool in my opinion."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great spot to grab a bite, coffee, latte, iced tea bagel or pastries right across from the beach."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Wonderful cafe...especially if you're up early with the pelicans and want to get a breakfast that will sustain you for the day. Their Oatmeal is awesome: huge portions and they must have it steeping in their creamy secret all night and with their Agave on top and a Flat White aside there is no better ignition in Sunset for a busy day. Great service. Quirky collection of local workers, fisherpeople, original hippies, hipsters, commuters but tourist-free. The rest of the menu looks awesome also though 05.30 is my constitutional there so I haven't been around to dabble in other foodtimes."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Waited over half an hour for 2 sandwiches. You can't find the prices for their food on their site or anywhere, there's a reason. It's expensive! $30 for 2 sandwiches. Though they were big I would not have waited that long for them being a CAFE! Seating is very limited and uncomfortable. Very hipster environment where everyone is sitting on their laptops taking up all the tables."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Java  cafe has some great sandwiches! When ordering just remember that they come BIG! So a half fills you up like a full. There Cole slaw is different than I've ever had, but in the best way possible, it has a little kick to it and cranberries absolutely delicious! The ladies that work there were super sweet and helpful. I live in Sacramento and this was my 2nd time back and will be back again."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Amazing! We love every thing we ever order here! Though our favorites are the tsunami and blt sandwiches! So yummy! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The coffee and bagels aren't bad either!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Lovely staff, chilled out environment with friendly customers, power sockets for computers, and an ocean view!  A real shame, but the food wasn't great - the chicken in my salad was very dry.  Didn't try the coffee."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A great little cafe to visit whether you're near the beach or visiting the zoo.  They have a wide range of coffees and ice creams to satisfy the cravings of everyone in the family.  They also have lunch foods like sandwiches and soup.  Their outdoor seating area is great if you visit on a rare warm day, but prepare for fog in this part of the city."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,It takes really long time for how basic the food is to make.  I wish they express that the secret sauce is Italian dressing.  My sandwich was a soggy dripping mess of Italian salad dressing.  It over powered the whole meal.  I would not have ordered had I know.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great sausage sandwich and baked goods (get the soda bread)
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,This place is great for a quick bite or beverage (although service can be kinda slow on a hot beachy day.) Today I had a jumbo Arnold Palmer after a jog to the beach and it hit the spot! I can't wait to try their food next time. It's also nice that there is wifi and plenty of indoor/outdoor seating! Expect the crowd to be local and eclectic. Today I saw a woman sipping a class of chilled white wine practicing a bit of Opera singing. :D
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Awesome café next to the beach. Nice terrasse, the coffee is good and cheap enough. Croissants are actually real croissants, I was impressed (I'm french). The salads look big and delicious (but I hadnt the occasion to try)."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Underwhelmed for  my first visit. Huh?!  It was a packed house, not a voice could be heard, 20 full zombie tables with no one eating, just a  sea of laptops for free wifi. Don't bother going after 5pm.  Beware of the coleslaw so spicy and inedible. The ham and cheese sandwich was a child's portion, small and undesirable for $9. I recommend making friends with someone who works there,  to get a table, if you like grumpy staff. One handed me a menu when I asked her about cheese selection. Can you not remember it all darling?"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This place is one of the few cafes where you can kind of see the ocean while sitting outside.  No idea why there aren't more of those along Ocean Beach (not blocking the view of course, but on the opposite side so diners can enjoy from across HWY 1) Anyway, I had the Spinach quiche which is one of my all-time favorites and Java Beach makes a good one!  Coffee is yummy too.  If you want to make a trek to the SF zoo afterward, it's across the street."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,take the muni for an hour just to come here sometimes. Love this place so much. Get a iced vanilla bean latte and then stroll on the beach :)
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I ordered an arnold Palmer and was not impressed.  Something seemed off--it may have been the tea being old.  My friends ordered tea and they were not fans.  I ordered a sandwich that was chicken with avocado on ciabatta bread.  The chicken could have used some seasoning I think.  The sandwich was pretty bland to my taste.  The coleslaw was flavorful and peppery.  I would recommend that if the pepper in the slaw was the norm, perhaps a warning on the menu might be a wise addition.  It has some heat to it.  There giant chocolate chip cookie had a nice flavor and texture to it and the hot salami-type sandwich my wife ordered was quite nice."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"One of the best lil coffee spots, a leap from Ocean Beach... You can catch the Sun Rise Or Sun Set just by crossing the road!!! And the trolley N Muni, stops almost at it's door! What a sweet spot! You know it'll be almost a year that I last went but it's funny how found memories come back to us Soo vividly!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great vibe and okay coffee. Really enjoy the staff, who were fun and polite. Definitely a lot spot with lots of regulars and nice community. Should grab a bite and head to the beach, so close and an opportunity only in beach city!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great location. Pastry selection is good. Coffee in my opinion is a little over roasted, a bit bitter for the straight up black coffee drinker."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,1st timer. I decided to get me a 16oz latte with hazelnut and a add shot of espresso.  I watched these two Baristas makes coffee and they really put a lot of effort to it. My latte was superb and so good. Walked to the beach and enjoyed every sips to my latte.  Thank you Java Beach Cafe for wonderful experience.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Nice atmosphere right next to the beach. Loved the live outdoor music on a Saturday afternoon. Tumeric latte was just OK.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is a local place that defines the area for me. Just walked the beach and need something warm to drink, maybe a sandwich, salad, soup, pastry, or brewski? It's always tasty here. It's a medium sized place, with a patio. It's always lively, lots of different walks of life here. Spend a while and relax."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Not sure how fresh their wraps are. They gave me one with questionable lettuce and shape. Seems like the lettuce was left in the fridge for a few days. Once I mentioned it, they changed it right away and said ""here is a fresh one"".  While I'm glad they changed it, it's not something we should have to ask."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I had their light roast coffee, hit the spot! They rise to the occasion of providing speedy service to guests off the beach."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great coffee shop with free wifi. Barista-made drinks are wonderful (I had a cappuccino) as are their baked goods. Incredible location near the water where you can heard the waves and smell the ocean
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Soooo yummy cheese subs - choose 3 kinds of cheese, get it served with potato chips and crispy fresh lattice - no visit to SF can go without! Also good with coffee and for relaxing/socializing, with our without book/newspaper/laptop :) two minutes from the ocean"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great spot right at the end of the  MUNI N Judah Ocean Beach line. Sandwiches are pretty good but won't blow you away. Usually pretty popular and tough to find a place to sit. Coffee isn't the best for a café but it works. Mostly busy because of the location.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"My favorite coffee shop by the beach. They brew up a mean cup of joe here and make some tasty,hefty sandwiches too. They've even got a little bar in back with draft beer. The occasional live band shows up outside for some entertainment.  The biggest downside to the place is when the hog bikers show up and take over the place."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I love riding my bike here to grab a coffee, then walk across the road to watch the sunset. They're usually packed and seating can be hard to find. They have a great selection of pastries and prices are reasonable."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Busy beachside coffee shop. Good coffee, quick and friendly service. Not a culinary destination."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in San Francisco. It's close to the beach and serves warm beverages, pastries, and alcoholic drinks. You can bring in your laptop and do some work inside, as well as hang out under the stars any given night nature allows.  I promise you will be convinced the moment you take a sip of your first latte but the hot chocolate is my fave."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Should be a five star but... they seriously need a bigger kitchen. 40-45 mins to receive a sandwich is extreme. That’s 45 mins from the time you order. Anyways, the food is yummy, the staff friendly but the wait times are over the top long. Java Beach - you need to find a solution."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Delicious sandwiches and coffee.  Perfect for a quick bite after a walk along the beach.  Turkey Club +++
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Slightly rude . Maybe racists. The communication between front of house and back of house is not what it should be. This review comes in after having my order done wrong 3 times in 1 day. The food does taste good tho. No complaint there.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"It's your average cafe. You don't come here for the food (which IS decent, and no place in SF survives if it's sub-par); you come here to meet up with friends and then enjoy one of San Francisco's best features -- Ocean Beach.  Man your tide charts!  The coffee is varied and excellent. Over the years has tended towards over-roasted, but apparently the locals like that; even so it's pretty darned good.  Don't spend too long here; that's not the point of the place. Stop here with friends (whether coming or going) -- and the N-Judah is nearby.  But the Java Beach Cafe is a fixture in many locals' minds as a place to grab a bite or a cup of coffee, perhaps meet up with or say goodbye to friends at, or just wander in and see what particular brands of SF wierdness confluences are synchronistically gathered at that place at that time. (The staff have LOTS of strange stories.)  Worth a visit -- with friends. Friends make the world go round."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,This place was a nightmare. I called the number Google gave me and when I got there they said they never got a phone call for my order. Not sure what that's about. An hour later and I still don't have my sandwich. There are three to four people making sandwiches at a time and only one is being produced every 10 minutes. Poor management of time.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Easily one of my favorite local Coffee and breakfast spots. They have tons of seating both indoors and outside making it dog friendly! They even serve beer in the evenings! Can't beat that!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"It’s a cute, atmospheric place in a nice location and with nice staff. We just got coffee but threw it away as it was awfully bitter. Maybe we just got unlucky…"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,The dark coffee packs a punch. Really good brew. Bran muffins too. Only gripe would be that they are supersized
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,So so sad 🥺 this place used to be the best but the last few times I've been there the servers have been borderline aggressive and the food has been so messy that it just seems like they don't care anymore. What happened guys? I shan't be back but y'all should recognize the only thing that made your insane wait times bearable was good service and the best sandos
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,The turkey sub is awesome. I loved my coffee and the kids loved the sandwiches and the hot chocolate.. great food and portions
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great place to go, when foggy or sunny, after a park visit for lunch or a cookie. Coffee looks good  (haven't had it myself). Nice staff, always interesting crowd there."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great location close to Ocean Beach, with good seating and wifi to work, and friendly service, but the coffee and pastry I ordered were mediocre and dry respectively."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"nice, cozy place! The staff is friendly and attentive! All liked it!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Alot of sandwiches also grilled and they were great, i saw great salads at other tables. And realy Fair prices. U order and ur name get called out you can sit Inside or outside. Good food if ur done at the zoo and your hungry."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great place, great service. All very relaxed and comfortable. Their irish soda bread was excellent! I made myself some honey butter with the honey they have at the bad and slathered it on for the perect added touch."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Fun laid back sort of place with a lot of eccentric locals. Their salads and sandwiches (and desserts!) are huge and delicious, and their Bernie's Blend coffee is definitely worth a try."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Nice location just over highway 1 across from the beach. It was pretty crowded when I visited, a lot of people sucking up the free wifi on their laptops. I'm not a big coffee drinker and I had a white chocolate mocha that I liked a lot. My girlfriend got the caramel latte, which tasted like straight latte without any caramel taste to it. When she was finishing her drink, she found all the caramel gunked up at the bottom of the cup. You would think a coffee shop would figure out a way to properly mix the caramel into their coffees."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I love the feel of Java Beach. Even though it's busy, you always feel welcome! The chocolate chip& baileys soda bread is amazing. So is the salmon sunrise bagel. It's all just delicious."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Three times in a week! I had the Bonfire delight and my partner who is a very picky eater especially when he reads the word ""dressing or mayonnaise"", it's all his fault after he tried my sandwich, he had to have it the next day. Yummooooo!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"HUGE portions, good coffee, and they often have live music. I've only been on weekdays, but it's never been too crowded and I've always found a space to sit down."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Love, LOVE LOVE this place.  Coffee is amazing, the irish soda bread is a must!  Fast, friendly service.   Sometimes a line in nice weather, but the staff moves fast.  I couldnt reccomend this place more.  I stop here everytime I'm in the city"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Easily the best place to go on Monday morning. Foggy, quiet, good food."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Compared to the JBC on Sloat this one is more crowded and I dare say...worse. Both places have very slow WiFi BTW. But this place is just a bit darker, wetter, and I once possibly got mild food poisoning from their soup. Still, it’s not a bad place to grab some drinks and sit while you’re nearby."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"This is the place to go for bringing coffee to nearby ocean beach. It's popular, so wait-time for drinks can be a while. Rotating beers on tap. Outdoor and indoor seating but good luck getting it--the free wi-fi sucks up the majority of tables."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I absolutely loved this place. Lovely people working there, live bands once in a while, free wifi, delicious food, loved the salads. Cozy place, So worth it!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Awesome cafe down near the beach. They usually have the windows open for fresh air and sunlight. It's a great place to work if you want to take a vacation to the beach. Good wifi.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Live music, awesome staff, great coffee, and close to the beach. Really great place. WiFi is really slow though, this is not the bring your laptop cafe, it's the bring a friend one."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Caramel latte was amazing! I like this place
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Brilliant…love this place. Wonderful staff, perfect location, comfortable, cozy, can’t say enough. Will make this place a regular visit whenever in town."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"My community coffee shop hub very good coffee drinks , good grub wonderful welcoming staff and ownership provides very good service we’re very fortunate to have such establishment in our community"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Nice beach cafe. Relaxing place to work or hang out. Food was good. Please add bacon as an add on. Seemed expensive for what you get but it is San Francisco. Staff was friendly and helpful.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great service with a genuine smile. A great variety of offerings in the menu that caters for most dietary requirements. Being able to sit outside and welcome the fog, smell the ocean air, etc. give it the fifth star."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"My fav place to visit when in the city! Great coffee, great people!! Love their little park too!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Really great environment, great place to get some work done. Fun to go with friends and just chill out. They also have the best scones and mochas. I love this place so much."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Always incredible. Yummy baked goods and coffee in the neighborhood. Lots of outdoor seating.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Good place to stop in the morning for Coffee and pastries usually 2 people working. I didn’t have to wait long. It’s actually inside one of the hotels with a boardwalk entrance.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Good coffee but took forever for our bagels. I don't know why they took so long because they weren't toasted or even warmed.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Amazing sandwiches and cinnamon roll to die for!!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Good and varied food, laid back atmosphere, and free Wi-Fi. They also have wall sockets available for your electronic needs. Took one star off because I think the terrace tables could be a little cleaner."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I like to take a walk down the Ocean Beach pathway and stop in at Java Beach Cafe for a cup of coffee (hot or iced) or an iced tea to bring along.  If I'm feeling extra special, I might sidle up to the bar area and have a nice bear break.  Beware of hipsters, toddlers and dogs on leashes blocking the sidewalk."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,What would sf be without this place? It puts the beach town feel into sf. Nothing except the service will blow you away but you probably don't deserve any better.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"If you visit the Sunset District, Ocean Beach make sure to stop by. It is a small place inside, and lots of seats outside. I stop by when I visit Ocean Beach to watch the amazing sunset."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Worst hot chocolate, ever.  If you enjoy lukewarm milk with a hint of chocolate flavor, then you'll love it. Otherwise, take a hard pass."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"They were run out of bread, wrap so NO sandwiches, subs or wrap. It was only 2:45 pm today, so disappointing"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,The closest coffee and food the The Great Highway Inn. Local flavor with a fairly extensive choice of breakfast/lunch items. Friendly courteous staff. Reasonably priced.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,We had a delicious chai in these beautiful illustrated paper cups after our bike ride next to the beach.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,it is a great place with great stuff to eat and drink!!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Great Coffee and the BLT Sandwich is a reason to visit. The location is perfect since it near the Golden Gate Park and Cliff House. The Muni N- Judah LRV stops directly in front.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Amazing breakfast! Very good atmosphere and very friendly staff!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,I have visited this cafe three years in a row on vacation. It has gotten even better since they stay open longer. The coffee is fantastic and they have several brews. So close to the beach!!
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Great location right by the beach,good coffer, and food. The food is a little expansive, but they have  heathy choices and good pastries. They also have good live music some nights."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Love this place. Good coffee and food but be prepared to wait a bit for food. Good vibes, good people and open decently late. Crowded on weekends."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Their coffee is delicious but their vegan cookie I got from them tasted stale and kinda gross. It's a very chill place everyone there seems nice.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Sandwiches are really good. Good value for price. I recommend this place to grab a quick sandwich to take in or out. Very cozy place. It looks like it is very popular in the neighbourhood.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,There are people constantly standing around without masks where you order and pick up food. When you order online you have to ask for your food when they are handing out others food but they won't ask people to leave the pick up area. I yelled at the people to move so I could get my food and the woman behind the counter wouldn't give me my food.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,At the beach which is a plus. Food and coffee are consistently good. Fairly expensive e.g. 5.00 for a latte. 10 bucks for a sandwich. Outdoor seating. Sometimes could be cleaner.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Java Beach is a staple of the Sunset district, mostly because there's so little competition. The place is usually packed and noisy (they play the music too loud). The people who work there are extremely nice and the drinks/food aren't bad (the baked goods, only so-so). But I find it often very uncomfortable and not that welcoming. They seem to pack everyone in and, honestly, the interior is nothing special (I liked it better when they had sofas). So, if you're in the neighborhood, it's kind of the only game in town and not a bad option. But I really wish there were more cafes in the Sunset to give this one some motivation to improve. At least this JB is far better than its sister JB out by the zoo which is a really generic, uncomfortable and unappealing. SF can do better in the cafe department.  Also... Java Beach has horrible, unlistenable, unescapable live ""music."" (and the recorded music is too loud too) Please cafe owners, know that bad music doesn't bring in business, it kills it. I go here less because the live music totally kills whatever relaxation there is to going here. You can't talk to friends and it's almost impossible to relax and read or write while some schlub is singing horrible 70s songs. :("
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,Food and drink always good. The space is a bit cramped and loud but I'm sure I'd never go below 4 stars for it. I have to save 5 for unusually special finds or especially great pricing.
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"I had a terrific burger with a side salad, and it was exceptional. The mango beer is not on the menu but you should definitely ask for it. So good!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"A chill cafe with solid eats, barista coffees, wine and beer. I like to bring my drawing class there for a field trip drawing the faces. Lots of people sit at a table for an hour and are flattered to have students draw them. Characters abound."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"The new policy here is if you aren't drinking or eating something that you bought there you can't sit outside even when the place is empty! Used to be a cool place, now just a breeding ground for douche bags!"
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Cute little spot next to Ocean Beach. Loved that they had upbeat oldies playing :) Food was yummy, but the place was a bit of a mess. Had to clean off our table before we sat"

Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Good food and a friendly staff. Prices are OK - not low, but it is San Francisco after all. They probably pay a fortune in rent. The place was busy, so it appears to be popular."
Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,A bit pricey but very San Francisco.

Java Beach Cafe,1396 La Playa St,"Big fan of the Java! Also their java club with turkey. Great muffins, lovely staff and pretty nice outdoor seating since Covid"
