Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Coffee is so good, they also have really good food and cool animal shaped baked bread!"
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Not clear the Coffee was made not by boudin but peet. It was therefor cold waiting for me. Nevertheless good taste and atmosphere.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Occasionally,  my wife and I will drive in to San Francisco, just to pick up some of our favorite sourdough bread at Boudin's, and today I decided to try one of the almond croissants with a cup of decaf coffee. With just a tad of half and half, the coffee was perfect. Didn't have an aftertaste, nor was it bitter...mainly smooth. We sat down and enjoyed our pastry with our beverage.  I'll have to be on the lookout for Peet's Coffee, and see if it is available in pod form. I was thoroughly impressed and turned on by this cup of joe which was being brewed and served at Boudin's. Good bread, some homemade preserves, and a great cup of coffee is my way to start a good day, especially when the weather is rainy and chilly."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Great coffee! Excelent place! So many options to eat! The Boudin is not cheap and recomend the outside clam chowder!
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Breakfast good. But very cold room temperature because of open door. We asked to close the door, was not allowed!"
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,The clam chowder is AMAZING! 10/10 highly recommended!
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Nice location, great bakery and coffee"
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Great place which is inside Boidin Bakery and Restaurant. IMHO just about the best coffee in SF.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Always in the mood for coffee. Thank you Peet's coffee for the fresh and delicious cup of joe.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"I haven't been to a Pete's in probably ten years.  The coffee was good, but they don't offer a pour over of a bean of my choice.  That is what made Pete's good."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Great cafe. You can never ever go wrong with Peet's. Best espresso, hands down."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Had Peet's with a bakery item from  Boudin in SF....warmed the soul on a cold morning.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Peet's Coffee isn't amazing but it isn't bad and it isn't Starbucks lol. I will buy from Peets when I can't get to one of my favourites in preference to anything else. Service here was good. There is power and wifi available for the laptop and device junkies.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"I was given the incorrect items-not what I ordered. When I mentioned that to the barrista, he shrugged his shoulders and then ignored me. Also, the Havana cappuccino was a very bad choice-very sweet dregs at the bottom-not blended at all, I have had a much better response from Starbucks when my order is wrong-they always then give me my correct order,"
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"I wish I could leave a negative star.  I love Peet's coffee...but if this location was my first ever experience....It would have been my only experience ever.  My daughter and I stood at the counter for 5 minutes being ignored while the male and female working behind counter carried on a conversation, laughing.  Finally my daughter interrupted and asked if we could order.  There were no other customers sround. They took forever to make our drinks.  When I finally got mine. ...it was all foam and the milk was scorched.  I took it back and the male tried to school me on how a cappuccino is all foam.  He was so rude and didn't care about my drink.  The 2nd one was just as bad.  DON'T go here!  No wonder there weren't any customers!"
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,I Love Peet's Coffee it the best.  At this location I had been here before several times. I experience bad customer service from Hispanic cashier and Asian helper in the mornings. I normally come in for a Carmel macchiato. Not all locations know how to make it well. Here they make it light. I like it just right. I had asked for more carmel syrup the Asian helper replied there should be enough there. You shouldn't let your drink sit there for to long. I didn't care for her opinion. I just want more in my drink that I paid for it.  The milk was flat along with the drink. Had to ask her twice before I can get more.  Not good. Today I asked the Cashier for more syrup. She claims I didn't by my drink there. And wanted to charge me additional fee to add more Carmel syrup. I had asked her 3 times. Until i had to get upset and give her attitude about it. I told her it was bought there. All I wanted was extra Carmel syrup givinga hard time. The guy who makes the drinks was awesome he helped me out. I like how he makes the drinks.  He provides good customer service.  Please fix the issue with these girls.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Does not honor Peet’s gift cards. How is that possible?  Slow customer service. On top of that burned cold coffee. That’s not what I ordered. Would have complained but that would have taken another 20 minutes.
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Delish Americano! Thank you to the sweet barista who added steamed milk and a dollop of whip cream...so goooood!
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"As a Peet's barista, this location does not meet standards. Service is unfriendly and unhelpful. I know this place gets a lot of foot traffic, but come on, Peet's, don't let people think this is an acccurate example of the brand."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"The Peet's Coffee & Tea is an oasis of humanity on The corner of sixth and Judah in the inner Sunset. Sam, the proprietor, is a blessed soul. Generous and kind, always having a good word and an uplifting message. The coffee is fabulous check it out."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Coffee is very good, better than Starbucks. Their standard is serving cold monkey bread. That is unacceptable. Service is mediocre- feels like the customer is a burden."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"bad attention, very expensive and not tasty at all, very stale bread, clam chowder is the only thing i recommend, you better looking for other options"

Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,Not actually a Peers coffee. They serve most Peets drinks but it's actually part of Boudin. Expect a long line and no wifi
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Friendly, fast, great coffee and Boudin's fresh baked goods are right there. Walk outside for great views of Alcatraz."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,The Honey Harvest Latte is the best latte I have ever had. Very cool environment.  Great place!
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Very good, we had the Golden latte.  It is spicy and is made with a mixture of ginger and turmeric."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Great coffee shop along coastline of San Fransisco. Fresh bread and pasties, with outdoor seating."
Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,"Pete’s is a great brand, there of course is better coffee around, but for the price I’d give it 5 stars"

Peet's Coffee,160 Jefferson St,I wouldn't recommend this Peet's if you are a Peet's drinker. The workers here don't make the drink right and barely speak English. That's a problem when I can't communicate to staff how to make my drink.
