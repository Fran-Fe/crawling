Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Wonderful morning brunch atmosphere. Great service and beautiful vibes. Stars for the atmosphere. The pizza is a thin bread with a few slices of salmon, not worth it for the price. The french toast was completely bread putting, but it was a wonderful dessert. Overall great place to stop if you are near by, just overpriced."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"We were sat immediately and the service was lovely; we ordered the salmon cozy, poached egg and chicken sausage, and soft scrambled egg and spinach toast - all of which were lovely albeit overpriced. It smelled strongly of bacon in the whole place which was both yum and overWhelming. Besides the cost and the heartburn I liked it"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I am from the Los Angeles area and I was recommended this place. I had the breakfast pizza. It was smoke ham with 2 overmedium eggs. Something different and I have to say very delicious. The dough was crispy and delicious. Will return when in town. Our server was Christine, I think. Lol."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Very friendly and attentive staff. Really enjoyed the smoked salmon pizza. Drip coffee was fine, too. A bit surprised when breakfast for two came out to $100, but such is life."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"What a cute little place! There are some interesting options on the menu, including dozens of flavors of Italian soda, and unique presentations of sandwiches (the salmon cozy is salmon and veggies wrapped in toasted flatbread). There's plenty of outdoor seating, with tables that are fully covered, and seats in the afternoon sunshine. Service is friendly and efficient, and the menu changes often. I look forward to my next visit!"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Ok so we were lucky to get in at closing and really appreciate that as we know what it's like when someone shows up just before closing. They were very friendly and made us feel welcome even tho we know they all wanted to go home. I will say that the one star loss is due to the $5 up charge for arugula on our breakfast pizza. We were asked if we wanted to add it but we're not told there was a charge. $5 for a small handful of greens is a lil much just saying. Oh definitely try the lavender lemonade!
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Great brunch spot! The garlic potatoes were a great app -- ketchup was homemade too! Had the smoked salmon breakfast pizza, which was also very good."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Amazing French style breakfast place. The coffee was great. The grilled chicken sausage and polenta with poached eggs was delicious. The polenta was light and creamy and mixed very well with the mild salsa. And to top it off, bread pudding with cinnamon caramelized apples and ice cream was heavenly. Best breakfast I’ve had in a long time. Will be going back soon!"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,My salad and pizza are soooo good. Only a little bit disappointed that the waitress constantly pushing us to pay for the bill without any client waiting there. Kind of annoying. But food is really good.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Great service. We were seated quickly and had a very nice server who gave us good recommendations. Lattes, pastries, granola, and the chicken sausage with polenta were delicious and satisfying."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Cute, casual brunch place. Lots to choose from on the menu, which is printed new every day. Tea was great."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"We ordered a breakfast pizza with ham and eggs. It was not tasty at all. For such a price, they could use Italian prosciutto instead of the cheapest disgusting American ham."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Got some good Italian food in a cozy setting on Union St. Had a very good dinner with the Mrs. the other night at Roses. I’ve never been a big olive guy but the marinated olives were great. The clam pasta was perfectly made and had a lot of flavor. The braised beef was cooked perfectly. I wish I ordered desert but what are you going to do. They have a great wine selection and offer friendly service. Not bad.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"The service, food and ambiance are never lacking. Really love their french toast which is different from regular french toast."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I came in craving a savory brunch, but ended up succumbing to sweetness with no regrets! It was the perfect combo of tender, juicy, caramelized apple on a richly dense French toast bread pudding topped with a delicate, fluffy whipped cream. I absolutely loved the apples and, after devouring everything, I was very excited to get my spoon out to scoop up all the juicy goodness left by the juice of the apples mixing with the melted whipped cream."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Delicious food! We came her on the recommendation of a friend and got the French toast as well as a potato pancake. One of the best brunch spots I’ve ever tried (not just in the city, ever!) I would definitely go again"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Very friendly service.  Sit outside and enjoy the breeze and people watching. Food was prepared well and has lots of flavor.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,The coffee was so good and definitely get arugula on the breakfast pizza! Would go back next time i am in town.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I had such a great time at this cafe! I went here with my family and friends before a wedding dress appt. We got brunch - I got the breakfast pizza and garlic potatoes. The lemonade was a little sour so I recommend asking for the simple syrup, then it’s perfect. All the food was great, it was a delicious thin crust. Thank you for supporting a great day."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"rude staff. ordered a omelette without spinach, and when it came with spinach and I pointed that out, the waiter got mad and walked away. wasn't very comfortable eating the replacement (which wasn't anything special for 20 dollars either). a misunderstanding can happen, but let's stay polite to each other."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Perfect little spot to have a bite and sit and think. Food is delicious, and plentiful. Waitstaff is consistent, courteous, and kind. Definitely a great place to come. Has a European vibe. The scrambled egg was cooked absolutely perfectly."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Very well managed brunch place. Made me feel safe dining out(covid safety measures). I liked everything I ordered but I found a bone in the chicken sandwich after which I lost my appetite. Would rate it 5star if not for the bone. The waitress did not change the sandwich or adjust the bill.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Steelhead trout with fresh veggies was delicious & flavor explosion! My husband loved the burger, and their bread was delicious. We shared a side of cauliflower which we both enjoyed. It was nice to sit outside, and they have heaters. We've always enjoyed our dinners here."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Thankfully some places remain the same! This neighborhood bistro has always been a spot I fondly think about when visiting the city. The ambiance, service, menu and location are like seeing an old friend."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Such a lovely place for breakfast, the vibe reminds you of a cafe in Europe. Service was great and the food even better. Highly recommend the sausage and polenta, breakfast pizza and sandwiches. They also have lavender lemonade which is soo good. Their variety of teas is also exceptional."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"On the way down from Steiner street we stopped at this cafe. We just needed coffee and a hot chocolate. The coffee was quite small and the roast was slightly burnt, but not too much that the acridity made the coffee undrinkable. The Hot Chocolate was a warmish chocolate which was a let down on a cold day so could've been much better. The waitress was attentive so service excellent, if the drinks were on par this would've been a 5 star rating,"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"While I was skeptical about their breakfast pizza at first, the instant I saw it, I knew I wouldn't have any issues. The eggs are perfectly cooked in the center with the slices ham constituting the main body of the pizza. Additionally, the size was perfect for one person or could be easily shared between two. The ambiance was also reminiscent of Italian and French sidewalk cafes that I had seen in Rome and Paris. Its location a few blocks off of Lombard st is perfect for a quieter and more intimate experience."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Do yourself a favor and get the breakfast pizza or the chicken sausage dish! The flavor combinations are amazing! I was not a fan of the cappuccino, it was water down in my opinion. However, would go again any day for the food."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Kristen is the waitress you want; she has a delightful genuine personality and excellent menu recommendations. This place is not only relaxing in its own charming way, but the flavors of the food transports you to another realm. The music is tasteful and not too loud, which is a rare occurrence in todays food industry."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Cute cafe. Seemed the breakfast pizza was popular so we ordered that too along with the clam cream pasta. The clam was a but salty but overall delicious. I loved the dish design especially.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,A place with great Italian food and attentive staff.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Rose's Cafe is a nice little place in Cow Hollow. The bread is very good and everything I have ever eaten here has been fresh and well prepared. They have an outdoor patio type seating area that offers a nice relaxed place to eat. Try the spinach and prosciutto.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Serving great comfort food. The atmosphere is totally relax and friendly. It’s like sitting at your mom’s dining table and just enjoy good home cook meal. I love it!
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"This is about breakfast. Always passed by this place and wanted to try it finally (usually go to home plate/cracked & battered for breakfast). Not a lot of choices, what we ended up getting didn't taste good, unseasoned, you wouldn't be able to tell the Yukon dish had all the mentioned things in the description for how tasteless it was. Overpriced for what it was. For example the salad one of us got was a handful (probably 5c worth) of spring mix and squeeze of lemon for $13. Server was friendly enough but this is about the breakfast we had that wasn't good at all for nearly $100 with tax and tip. Went to Home Plate afterwards to eat again."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Love this neighborhood cafe. The outdoor seating is straight off a street in Paris. We went with the Breakfast Pizza to try something different it was delicious- like a breakfast sandwich but better! It is a must try.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Salmon cozy is terrific. Christine did a great job serving us and backed up by an all star kitchen.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Murano glass chandeliers clue you in on the Italian origins of this cafe. The polenta is heavenly and even brunch can be turned into a pizza. Dine inside or out. Great place for solo diners.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Place was good enough not my favorite.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,Always love this place it’s like old skool SF. Always tasty and great service. If they still have it try the pizza with the egg on top for brunch.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food. I ordered the Turkey sandwich. I needed to order more mustard as I love the spice it adds but otherwise it was a delicious sandwich. The side salad was delicious and simple. It was a very filling meal. I heard the pizza was great too!"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Classic fare with some sweet china. Loved my asparagus potato soup, I would have ordered it again. Our family went twice while they were in town."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"The food looks amazing, but this is about what I witnessed when I went in. I wanted a drink and it took forever for someone to help me, but while I was waiting, I noticed someone who all the staff seemed to know. Not sure if she’s a co-owner or a manager but she’s blonde and she stuck her personal water bottle with the rim complete touching to the faucet that all the carafes are filled in. Just unsanitary and during Covid times (yes still) even more mind boggling."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I like the idea behind many of the menu items for this all-day breakfast restaurant.. But their hugely popular salmon pizza deserves a re-examination. The crust has no body at all, it's all crispy (when newly served) and toasty thin crust.  Does not even compare to the satisfaction you get when eating smoked salmon over a piece of cracker. Oh, coffee was terribly bad because it's cold and served in a bowl-like cup. Service was great but servers seem to mind only their own guests."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Service was friendly and quick for takeout.  linguine and clams just the right amount of sauce, but had chili peppers so it was unexpected but I did not read the menu.  My bad. the steelhead was moist and flavorful.  Basic green salads were overpriced.  But that could be a union street thingy. The entrees a bit pricy but it was a special occasion."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Found this place on a food group that I belong to in facebook. I loved it so much, I went with friends three times in 2 weeks."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,I ate a lovely quaint brunch here a bit on the early side on Saturday morning. It's a small but delicious menu and the staff was so wonderful and courteous. They made excellent recommendations and brought everything out promptly. The outdoor seating was heated and it was such a peaceful start to the day. Definitely a 5 star rating!
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Rose's has been a Cow Hollow neighborhood institution for years. It can get busy during prime hours or weekends. Try the Salmon Cozy for brunch or one of their breakfast pizzas. Or a simple French omelet, it will tell you how well the kitchen is operated."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I've enjoyed this cafe ever since I lived in San Francisco about twenty years ago.  Their cafe latte is served in a bowl and is my absolute favorite.  The pizza oven churns out the most delicious breakfast pizza you can imagine - crisp and light.  Seasonings are not heavy, just right.  The food is imaginative, fresh and nutritious. Lavender lemonade is freshly squeezed and delicious.   The staff is always so friendly - Emily, our waitress, was a delight."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I love this café! I think it's easily one of the better breakfast spots in the city. Can be very busy over the weekend, I try to go during the week when it's much easier to get a table."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Amazing tea and dessert selection. It was hard to find a place with good dessert options in the city past 6pm and Rose's did not disappoint! Apple crisp, Strawberry shortcake and flourless chocolate cake were so good!"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Prissy Victorian place ;  as I ate , I listened to a friend drone about her challenges and her children’s lives; I was stuck in a soap opera ; thank God, I remain a bachelor;  the tasty french toast looks like a life-raft carrying soft apple slices into my mouth  ; my friend’s savory dish - potato hash with eggs onions cheddar. has depth ; the service was not warm , it was matter of fact and rushed. This place can serve as a mortuary as well; very mournful atmosphere here."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Best brunch! I've been going to Rose's for over 20 years. Cappuccino and croissants are a must and have a new dish each time. Dinner is delicious, too!"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,The hostess was extremely rude and snippy. Waited 20 minutes for them to come get the check and he said it was my fault for not putting the card on top in an extremely rude fashion. Management should have a chat with him on how you speak with customers.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,The food is always great here and the service is top tier. I highly recommend trying the food out here if you want to try something exciting.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Food is always fresh,  well prepared, and delicious.  All of the folks that work there are happy and friendly.  Grab a sunny sidewalk table!  I highly recommend!!"
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"This was a quite lovely place. I personally had the spinach blue cheese salad and the blue cheese was a bit strong but the over all salad I would give it a 9/10. I also tried a pasta, now that was on point! It was delicious. I had my coffee fix and what caught my attention is that they serve small sugar rocks whatever the correct name might be which I’m sure there’s a name for it. I loved that little touch to it, made it very unique for sure. The place was nice and cozy. I was able to enjoy some company, hold a nice conversation and enjoy a really nice meal. Parking was a bit difficult."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,The food is pretty amazing here and the service is top notch. I highly recommend trying them out when you have a chance.
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"I had the assortment of baked goods for breakfast with a cup of tea. First time I've gotten a decent cup of tea in America and the croissant might be the best I've ever had anywhere. The place was very busy, but we didn't feel rushed. A great start to the day."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Stopped by for a late Sunday lunch. They have a lot of outdoor seating which was perfect because we brought our dog. I got the turkey sandwich and my friend got the potatoe hash, both of which we enjoyed. The service was slow at times but overall fine."
Rose's Cafe,2298 Union St,"Server didn’t tell me arugula was $5 extra to add to my pizza and when we asked later she said. “Things are expensive around here, that’s just how it is”. Some warning would have been appreciated. Somehow my $25 pizza ended up being $50 when I added a side of fruit as well"
