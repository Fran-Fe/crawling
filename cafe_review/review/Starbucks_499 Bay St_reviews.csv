Starbucks,499 Bay St,"This place gets super crowded after 8:30am on weekdays, I had to wait over 20 min for my coffee.  Order ahead and save half an hour of your day.  The place doesn't have any seating, like a lot of Starbucks in San Francisco. Not sure why it is that way.  Coffee is as good as any Starbucks, food options are the same.  This is a take out place, not a Starbucks where you will relax and spend an hour having your coffee."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Bad customer treatment, no respect or morals, and on top of that I asked them for double chat coffee, they gave me some coffee, and when I inquired About coffee I told them this is not my usual coffee they didn't seem to care as if I took it for free even though I paid them 4$This is the last time I enter them"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Bought drinks and requested attendant to hold to drinks. I know I was late by 23mins and they had closed up so I understand that they didn't keep the drinks. But I still tried my luck since I paid for the drinks and knocked on the door as the same attendant was there, she totally ignored me and shook her head as a firm *No*. I felt let down."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"CATE who works here needs firing ! Awful customer service ! Shouting, telling customer what to do, who does she think she is when I told her about her poor attitude she said “welcome to San Francisco” what an absolute disgrace to the city she is a real miserable old woman. I hope when she travels somewhere someone shows her what hospitality is."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Worst Starbucks ever! Poor customer service, needs more staff so drinks can be prepared faster. No seating! Tables dirty. No idea why the coffee is so weak is US Starbucks? Nothing else to say really!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"3.5 stars is waaaaay too many. I arrived 20 minutes after they opened. There were 3 baristas and one other guy in the store. They informed me they ran out of coffee. Taking my money was accomplished quickly and efficiently. After that? Start your wait in a dirty, dingy and uninviting waiting room of decay and misery for the confused and overwhelmed baristas trying to somehow conjure up four cups of coffee (2 for me and 2 for the other guy). Starbucks would close this store if they had any humanity. You can get coffee across the street at the gas station."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"The older guy (glasses, not a lot of hair) apparently doesn't know how to read orders or do them correctly. Maybe he shoukd go take some reading classes and then give the service industry a try again."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"How can there not be any tables or chairs, with the huge amount of floor space you have available? Not only is it wasted real estate and wasted space you’re paying for rent, but it’s also a waste for the customers who see a store and want to sit down but can’t because there’s nowhere to sit down on!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"I love Starbucks, but this one definitely lacked customer service. The staff were not friendly at all. I asked for a pink drink and it literally looked and tasted like dirty grey water and had no strawberries in it at all. I showed them a photo of what a pink drink should look like and they just stared at me like I was crazy. They eventually made another which was exactly what a pink drink should be. Very lazy and rude."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Service is good, but the whole place urgently needs some clean up work, dirt just everywhere, windows, walls. Should not be a massive effort to make it shiny."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Great location (understand that it will have busy moments throughout the day), super kind staff. Definitely will visit again!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Very slow service. Nice folks working the counter but they need more support to handle larger crowds.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"They close extremely early, I lose my debit card there and they didn't help me to find or look into because they said It was illegal to enter, so at the end I lost the opportunity to use my card because I was there on holidays."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"No any chair can be taken , 😢I came here for relax after long walk"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Worst Starbucks I’ve been too yet. From the moment we walked in, it was disgustingly messy, urine and toilet paper scattered across the bathroom floor, baristas let coffees sit on bar without notifying customers our coffees we ready, refuse to call out coffee orders, staff not in uniform but in gym shorts, staff’s attitude not “wanting to be here” or refuse to greet customer, grab n go fridge was scarce, and the list goes on. Seriously don’t come here. Worth walking to the nearest location. Side note: my iced latte which is simplest to make, wasn’t even worth the hassle here."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Your typical starbucks outlet. Not the best food but they suffice on such a cold day. No seats at all in this outlet (just standing tables) so that's a pity
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Great location, friendly staff and the drinks came out perfect and quickly.  Love the Double Smoked Bacon, Cheddar n Egg Sandwich, we also had Yogurt and the Bacon, Gouda & Egg Sandwich.. All was great.."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Great place for a fast refreshment!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Probably the worst Starbucks I’ve ever seen. People working here are bored out of their minds. Wrong order, they forgot the food, this place is not remotely as clean as it should be. 🤢🤢🤢 …"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Great service as always, our breakfast go to for food and coffee!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Brutal wait time. At the end of a cable car route . Short staffed and very slow .
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Not your typical Starbucks; it needs a good cleaning and the baristas might need a refresher or two on certain drinks.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Busy location longer than usual waits but they have nice employees here.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"This location is a bit small, total of 5 tables: 2 high and 3 low. This is the dirtiest Starbucks that I have visited. I don't blame the employees. I blame Martha and other tourists who left behind their trashes, especially the paper from the straw."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,7am. no customers. no dark roast.  no cream cheese. music loud so repeated my order 3 times.  tried to use stars.  cashier mumbled something and my card got charged.  cashier mask on below nose then seems to mumble.  im ok with a mask but if you use it wrong then skip it.  then had to fix my order.  yikes hard pass.  coffee luke warm and odd taste.  i drink a lot of starbucks
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Huge space - not even one chair. Service is not friendly. Just find somewhere else to buy coffee.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,I'll always love Starbucks. The kids running these coffee shops are so professional now. I love the consistency of my coffee flavors when then they make it for me. It just tastes better. They brew love and serve happiness in a cup.❤️
Starbucks,499 Bay St,It's Starbucks! High top tables only when I went there
Starbucks,499 Bay St,The Lady with the name Pina is absolutely gorgeous and amazing! She always provide best customer service every time!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Very friendly staff, quick service even when busy."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"The only thing that this morning goes through 3 venti cafes and I do not understand why the blonde double shop venti just because I ordered it with little ice, they give me the medium size in a large glass .. I think they should remove the venti because it is the size  big is a robbery"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,They mess up orders and take too long
Starbucks,499 Bay St,It said on the door/times that it closes at 6pm. It was 5:45pm and they didn't let me in.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Nice customer service, great coffee."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Worst experience ever.. the staff worst service,  order late, no comunication,  bathroom worst ever. Need a good manager with proper skills and staff willing to work not just for a paycheck"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"There were no caribou coffee shops so Starbucks was it. On our last day on vacation we stopped in placed the order but while waiting noticed there was someone completing the orders and calling out the names. Maybe it was the mask but we couldn't hear anything so I asked her to speak up, she stopped looked at me and boldly said NO!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Staff disorganized.  Took 25 minutes.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Short on staff and poor service. I practically had to raise my voice to say ""excuse me"" so I could ask them for a Splenda for my coffee."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Horrible customer service minus Matthew. Walked in for 3 drinks, sandwiches  and 2 San Francisco mugs. My husband and I collect them from all over the world. I give the lady $100 bill. Guess what no change and no bags for my items. Just unacceptable. Do better!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Cashier was reading messages from her phone while taking orders
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"I understand it’s difficult time to hire now, but this location keeps having employers who have no clue at work. It would’ve be nice to have them trained instead slowing down the whole line in the morning ."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"I was glad that they had their blonde roast ready to serve during both of my visits. The staff was friendly and efficient. I'm not a huge Starbucks fan, but they did earn repeat business from me. 🙂 …"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,made the wrong order for me twice and the place was extremely dirty
Starbucks,499 Bay St,It was freezing cold after exiting the cable car. Ducked in here to grab a hot beverage.  Service was great as well as my coffee. Store and tables were clean. I purchased a new mug to start my collection over (lost many because of the Camp Fire) keep up the great service.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Nice quick service, however is a bit small and could have more seating."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,So close to Fisherman!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Nice little place. The only thing it’s is only take out. But at least service is fast, friendly, and tasty like always. Even they speak Spanish. Clean bathroom too."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Just of  the ship Great place for coffee and a chat. It has good fast and free WiFi most importantly. The staff are plesently nice and also three is a good selection of food for a fast getaway seem a popular place. Forgot to mention real close to fisherman's wharf,and pier 39, a must do."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"This is a very good location as it is near the Fisherman's wharf and next to the cable car turn station. I would give 5 stars, but sometimes when you ask them for Decaf coffee, they just tell you that they are out of it and if you don't precisely ask them to make some more, sometimes they won't offer to make more hoping you will just go away. If you ask them to make some more, they will but I feel that you should not beg them to make Decaf coffee at the coffee place (it's not like I am asking for free coffee). Almost every gas station has Decaf coffee and I feel that it's not too much to ask for a Coffee place to serve Decaf coffee at any time of the day while they are still open for service. Also, find that many of the homeless people end up using their restroom and many times they restroom smells so bad that it's hard to breath in the restroom. I understand that they can not habe someone sit by the door of the restroom to  keep homeless people washing themselves in there, but perhaps have a code lock on the door, and that way, I feel less of the homeless people will be showering in there, etc... Otherwise, the place is a good place to stop by and they also have decent size sit down area to enjoy your coffee."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"A cashier was a liar. After I purchased a coffee, I asked the passcode of the restroom. He said that the restroom was out of order. When I was back after 10 min, I saw that another customer was using the restroom."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,I went here last week.  Of course the bathroom was closed because a homeless druggie spread feces around on the floor.  Employee was there with door open wondering what to do.  They told me Trader Joe's down the street had a public restroom.  Great open door policy.  Enjoy it.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Typical Starbucks. Can't really get any different other than the staff and how the beverages are made. Completely satisfied other than it bring consistantly crowded until late at night. Nice feature about the place though are the wireless charging pads that are built into the large table in the middle. I have the Galaxy Note 8 so it supports the wireless charging facilities but it is limited to a trickle charge which can take quite a while. While it is a nice touch you are better off being your own charger and plugging it in an available outlet.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Good location next to Mason and Powell cable car turn around point.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Yes, it's like all the other Starbucks, but the consistency should be noted.  I'll be honest, I detest Starbucks coffee milk drinks, but when you want a coffee dessert in liquid form, a consistent frappuccino can really hit the spot.  So I'll add a star because you get what you expect every single time."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,My order was not right. No tables to sit inside.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Great taste and great value if you follow their e-coupons promotions. Special happy hours promo, 150 stars bonus promotion plus many opportunities to collect stars to redeem your food or drink."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Worst Starbucks I have been to consistently. They always mess up the coffees, whether it be terrible espresso (tastes super burnt), bad mixes with too much syrup, or just missing supplies such as the right cups for the drink.  Normally when I go to Starbucks I don't have to worry about the quality of the coffee, but not at this one. I will be looking for another Starbucks / coffee shop close to me now."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Wow! I have never ever been to a Starbucks and thought to myself ""this place is disgusting""..... Well today those were my thoughts when I went to this Starbucks. There was no way I was in a Starbucks but I was and it wasn't just the bathrooms as the pictures below show. It was the whole store. And the worst thing is it was dead so they could have been cleaning up the nasty floors with coffee stains and trash throughout the store but no they were just standing around talking. And on top of that he was training someone (suppose to be training)so now he is teaching the new person bad habits. It really saddens me that a Starbucks was in that bad of shape."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Matthew is not nice. I walk in, say “Hi, how are you?!” He just looks at me with a frown and says, “What can i get for you?” Then when I said I don’t want a receipt he rolled his eyes. My husband and I will not go back. Gave it one star because my drink was good."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Avoid this places!!! My husband and I visited San Francisco’s for our anniversary, we passed by this location on our way to the pier, we ordered around $30 on sandwiches, snacks and 2 coffees(we didn’t got a receipt). When we received our order a coffee was missing, my husband went up to the cashier (a very unhappy lady between 40-50 yrs) he tells her “I’m sorry, I am missing a coffee” her answer was “So” with a straight face. My husband said “well, can I get my coffee?” She looked at my husband again with a straight face and said “so are you going to order?” Please train your crew on how to handle this situation and also teach them some manners."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Great location for a Starbucks. The baristas were actually talented as well.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Very bad service. No place to sit down. I was told this is what they do on July 4th. Unoccupied chair was available. I was told chair was for employees only. Boss's orders. I asked to speak with Boss. Boss not there, would have to call. I advised I am diabetic, I need a place to sit. I was told it doesn't matter. If you want to drink your coffee sitting down don't go to this Starbuck's today!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"The cashier yelled us and run us from the place, because they were going to close. That happened on December 31st at the nigth. We were two different families  and she told us "" get out of here, move move"" while she moved her hand and stayed  on the door.  This service is Terrible, dont go to this place."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Not enough seats, the usual dronelike Apple laptop crowd monopolizing all available seating, crumbs and detritus on the available table space of one empty seat. Place had about 20 people in it, about 4 or 5 of them appeared to be drinking coffee. My group of three walked out."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"this was the worst starbucks I have ever been, in all countries. Awful costumer service. one attendent just refuses to sell me a Ethiopia kayon saying that would be too much work and he wouldn't do that. and then told me that if I want to drink a starbucks premium coffee, I should go to other coffee specialized place... would never come back. and I saw them opening the restroom door with a woman insidem just because she was there for more than 10 minutes, that's a crime!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,The seating in the previously posted photos has been removed
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Always packed with tourists. Very slow. You're not popping in to grab a quick coffee here! Otherwise, friendly staff and all the normal Starbucks things."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Another nice Starbucks!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Guy taking my order was great!  Guy calling out the drinks when they're done, sucked.  He did not call out my Name on the cup And he called out the wrong drink.  My Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino is not a Double Chocolaty Chip, which he called out when placing it on the counter."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Charging 1$ for a glass of water from your customers is unacceptable, you should be ashamed of yourselves taking advantage of your customers like that. They also charged me extra for my regular black coffee. Place was extremely dirty as was the bathroom.. will not come to this branch ever again"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,I ordered a Venti white chocolate Mocha and was given a grande. I was charged for a grande but the point is I wanted a Venti. I left right away because I needed to catch a bus back to my hotel. Then I took a sip of my drink and it didn't even taste like a white chocolate Mocha. Very disappointing.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Nice little shop to grab coffee near the warf. The barista Desi is amazing!! She made my coffee just right!! If you ever stop here, ask for her, she's the best ever!!!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Personally i dont like starbucks and have since stopped drinking their overpriced coffee due to their disrespectful attitude and the lack of consequences to the employees who continue in their actions against our LEO's. 😒 …
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Your average Starbucks. Nice employees, clean-ish, 1 bathroom, fairly busy most times, but you know what you're going to get when you order your favorite menu items."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"There are no tables or chairs in this branch, inconvenient for coffee"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"They didnt have Anything of what were tran to order saying that the machine was broken , it looked like they’re were just trying to sell what was easy to make like regular coffee….  👎🏼👎🏼 … not recommended …"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"It's a high throughput Starbucks in a heavy tourist area... Service is ""fine"", they could use a more effective layout given the traffic volume, and perhaps a more rigorous cleaning routine."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Cashier Catherine has bad attitude , tables and floor needs some attention garbage all over"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"It's actually pretty much like any other Starbucks that you'll find around, but because this is located right by the trolley stop, it makes this outlet rather popular. But it's no big deal if you ask me, it's just another Starbucks that's not more impressive than the next."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,It's my first time at this place I get in at 8:45 pm at 8:55 pm manager was putting al chairs up and telling costumers to get out cuz it close at 9:00 pm in a really rude way  didn't listen cuz according to the web they close at 10 and I tell him that they need to update they web cuz the difference of time and he just say in a rude way again that the schedule was on the door
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Its quite a big coffee shop. Has good amount of seats to relax and have a coffee. 3 stars because only 3 people works at this shop and when crowded you end up waiting for 20-30 mins to have your coffee.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Been here three times. Each time I receive extremely slow service and every time they forget the almond milk which I paid for. When I ask politely for them to add some, I get a rude look."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Food and drink was good but workers don't acknowledge you at all so walk up to counter and speak up if your picking up your order.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Typical city Starbucks, a little bit dirty (don't mention the toilets), but with fast service. I'm giving props to the cashiers who have to deal with tourists every single day that either don't know how to order or don't speak English. Talking about language barriers.  Verstehen Sie Deutsch?"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"This location has closed all it’s outlets so you can’t charge. Head three blocks down to 901 Columbus caffe. Ample outlets, bathroom and great staff."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Just like all the Starbucks in San Francisco. However,  it's not the most clean one. Food crumbs on the table. Flies fly around. But they serve your drink in a fast and friendly way."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Horrible customer service.
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"A starbucks, all are the same."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Great location, cappuccino & lemon cake a must for breakfast. A little stop after a city walk is mandatory, relax, good coffee and nice staff."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,The young lady that helped me was patient and informative. My coffee was hot and strong. These tbings assisted me in beginning a wonderful day!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Just another starbucks. Good place to hang out. Enough seating available. Mobile ordering is very handy, so that it is available by the time I reach the cafe."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"No bathroom, no caps takes em 10 mins to make a drink while it’s not busy. Just bad experience"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Just your classic starbucks. Quick and friendly service was provided as per usual for starbucks. I had the guava iced tea and it was very good.

Starbucks,499 Bay St,Nice 👍 yet managers do all the work and employees are so slow it took 15 min for drip coffee and two people in line ...lame and 😴..tourists also make it freaky  And bathroom is a health code issue

Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Perhaps the slowest service we have ever experienced at a Starbucks outlet. The order was for a single fruit cooler and it took 20 minutes. Baristas can only manage to make one order at a time, a not so customer centric practice. Just happy our Starbucks at home is the exact opposite of this experience. The lead or manager seemed only interested in wiping down the occasional table, instead of pitching in to expedite orders."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Good
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Good
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Worst Starbucks I've ever been to. With the quality of coffee, with service - everything is at the height of corporate standards ... But you can only drink coffee standing up. I was the only one drinking coffee inside. Everything is taken away, and on business. No one makes appointments here, no one comes to sit... I think explanations are superfluous..."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Next to the cable car station, it's easy to find no internal seats, buy it and take it away!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Pretty ugly Starbucks. No seating. Disks extremely dirty. Loveless cash cow at a cable car hotspot. This can be done better…
Starbucks,499 Bay St,almost no products There are only stand seats for security reasons The quality of the clerk is star ⭐️ 5
Starbucks,499 Bay St,No chairs and too weak Wi-Fi!!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"I have never been to a sao bad Starbucks. Only sales, then you have to go out again because there are no more tables in there. The service staff is very unfriendly. The guy who made our coffee didn't even look at us when we asked. Really rude. Paper on the toilet was already empty at 10am and therefore no one seems to have cleaned it. But the staff didn't really care. Awkward!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Dirty. Dirty and abandoned. Dust on the glass of the pastry and croissant counter. Dirty tables that we don't even clean if the previous user leaves. We have lived with a gnawed sandwich and an empty pot of coffee. Photo attached. The place is not full, so why are they dedicated to it."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,A starbucks like the others. Super free wifi with a lot of speed. Tables a bit dirty and sticky
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Many things to change! Very slow and listless staff, place without seating tables and I would also say not very clean. I'm surprised some Starbucks manager hasn't stopped by already!"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,There's always good coffee at Starbucs. The taste of coffee is the same all over the world
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Extremely unfriendly staff. The toilet was permanently closed. Never again this branch
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"This place was dirty nasty , It looked as no one cares about the company's business .!!!Workers scratch their a....s in the workplace , poor service , no any care for customer ... There's no one cleans , the house like homeless people place...  This place was dirty nasty, it looked like no one cares about company business. !!! Workers scratching A .... s in the workplace, poor service, there is no care for the client ... There no one cleans, the house is like a homeless place..."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Good place to have a coffee, but the attention of the service was not very attentive."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,Very slow service...we waited 15 minutes for my frappuccino...this is not Starbucks standard!
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"When I didn't know that there were many good coffee shops in San Fran, I went to Starbucks when I really didn't know anything. Too many other good places. No wonder... it's nonsense. Let's go four barrels."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"One more store in this chain, in this case very close to Fisherman's Wharf and one of the beginnings of the cable car, the classic San Francisco tram. Being a bit ""hidden"" (since it is not on the main tourist streets) it is usually crowded but you can find a place to sit."
Starbucks,499 Bay St,"Condescending staff when asking for simple things, horribly dirty toilets... Not at all the standard of other Starbucks. Go somewhere else (and there is no shortage around...)"
Starbucks,499 Bay St,The service is a DISASTER! Very bad customer service! Nothing recommended! The most expensive coffee but they serve you lousy!!
