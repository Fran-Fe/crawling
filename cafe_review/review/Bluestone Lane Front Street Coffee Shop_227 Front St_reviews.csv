Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"I stopped here on the way to the office during a work trip and I was somewhat underwhelmed. The avocado toast was tiny and had nothing but chili flakes on it— a bit sad. The matcha had very little powder, so it mostly tasted of milk. The staff is kind and the coffeeshop is cute though, they have comfy pillows, plants, and nice decor."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"Delicious coffee and nice staff! The breakfast  items are limited, but I liked the salad I got. It is nice cozy place! Like it!"
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"1st time visiting. Purchased a yogurt and croissant, which looked good. Welp! The yogurt was great...but that croissant was stale, and not fresh...as if it was from the day before. Next time ask how fresh is their baked goods before purchasing.  06/02. Changed my previous 1 star rating for I received a response to correct the matter by Bluestone. Thanks Bluestone, and I appreciate the gesture."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"Had a pretty good Breakfast All Day bowl. Good cafe for coffee and small bites, not so much a real “brunch” place. Very Keto friendly. Cute ambiance — nice furniture and decor."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"Delicious healthy food that tastes amazing, with unique online order system that is delivered to your table. It is a concept of “contactless” which I really like."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,Very busy in the morning but their self service kiosk is helpful. Nice environment but can get quite loud and difficult to talk. The coffee was good though.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,Absolutely love this place. Very quaint and cozy. I always get the mocha with oat milk. It is velvety and heavenly. I appreciate the fact it is not very sweet. Exactly what I remember a true mocha to be. Please do yourself a favor and get that little round cross bun looking pastry I don't know the name of it but that is addicting. The staff here are great. Very down to earth and not high stung. I visit the financial district location about three times a week it's that good.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,Delicious. Tasty. A perfect place to start your day with your family on the weekend or business breakfast fluting the week.
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"We were looking for breakfast and found this place. We had been to a Bluestone Lane in NYC and had enjoyed that visit. This was a much smaller cafe with some seating inside or outside. It is counter service only and the menu was much more limited than the other cafe we had been to. Coffee (cappuccino) was good but the avocado on toast and the smoked salmon on toast were disappointing, served in a cardboard box and pretty small for the cost. We would not try these smaller cafes again as they are more suited to those on their way to work."
Bluestone Lane Front Street Coffee Shop,227 Front St,"Saturday morning breakfast. Walked in spontaneously. Salmon toast, black coffee and a brownie. Everything was really good. Staff is super friendly and even remembered my name when I came back for another cup of coffee. Awesome! Highly recommended."
