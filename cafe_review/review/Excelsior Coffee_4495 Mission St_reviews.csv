Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Neighborhood gem indeed! Very cool little cafe with great coffee and food. There's lots of cool pictures on the walls and a motorbike at the back! There wasn't a lot of seating - a big table at the back and bar counter with 3 seats in front.  The Americano coffee was great - nutty and caramel in flavor. When we were there, there was a food pop up collab with Mahalo - we got the Mahalo Breakfast Musabi and the Breakfast Spamwich, both of which were great."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"This place has a great vibe, it is on the expensive side but it is worth trying. It was very interesting to see the decoration and merch found at the place.The service was fast since it wasn't busy. It has a big table in the back  and 3 stools to sit at the front. The drinks and pastries are different and interesting. I tried the horchata late and it was flavorful and the banana bread had banana chunks that added texture to it. I saw the croissant and the ube pastries and they all look delicious too."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"What a vibe! First, everything looks amazing from all the ube pastries to the merch and amazing curation of local art. This cafe is a real one. Would recommend checking out this  legendary spot and ordering a chagacinno for your soul!"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"I really like this place. The pastries are always tasty and the hawaiian breakfast sandwich pop up they do is really good. For drinks I usually do the chai latte. Merch is really cool too, I own a zip up hoodie.  Edit: Mentioned the dog that sits on the counter during afternoons and was asking about it. Thank you guys for clearing that up appreciate you being accommodating towards your staff!!"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Neighborhood gem. Good coffee, although I’m partial to their tea lattes which are simply wonderful. And the food choices cannot be beat. Between all of the ube delights and a rotating cast of amazing pop-ups, I always leave delighted."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Great Hojicha latte. Brownie was too sweet and didn’t have much ube flavor.
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Delicious Ube pastries, excellent Matcha latte (didn't taste sweetened, which was fine by me!), rad tee-shirts and sweatshirts for sale (I hope they get the Speed Demon one back in a small!)... And no-joke great customer service. Oh and the beautiful Excelsior District neighborhood photos, full of character and history, lining the walls, worth visiting for them alone! <3"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"A neighborhood favorite for their Ube treats and barista crafted coffees & teas. I always come here with my excelsior friends and love the local artwork/vibe of this cafe.  My point of view, cashew milk tastes superior, prove me wrong lol"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Latte and coffee were decent but the cold brew tasted like some kind of Chinese herb infused to it? They have an interesting selection of sweet treats as well as wall decor in the store.
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"My love of trying different coffee spots continues.  I try this motorcycle themed coffee shop in the Excelsior neighborhood of SF.  Very cool interiors with all sort of motorcycle themed items. I'm here for the espresso and the latte.  Great tasting and reasonably priced.  Saw a ube pop tart on display and decide to buy one!  Yummy.  The store is small and if you don't look for it, you can easily walk or drive by without knowing it is there!  Parking can be difficult."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Best croissants ever, coffee is delicious as well. Very cute cafe with friendly staff and gorgeous artwork for sale by a local artist. Can’t recommend this place enough!"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Rich delcious coffee and unique sweet treats with a great atmosphere. Some of the best coffee I've had in SF.
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Love this locally owned, woman owned, AAPI owned spot. Coffee and pastries are great, the people are kind and care about their customers. Highly recommend."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"We heard a lot about this place so we decided to give it a try. Got the Iced Horchata Latte and the Ube Pop-tart. The latte was just alright, though I would’ve liked a more prominent horchata flavor. On the other hand, the pop-tart was really nice.  Service-wise, it was just ok. Upon ordering, the male barista didn’t really greet or acknowledge us.. uninviting to say the least."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,My mocha was delicious! So happy to find this gem I grew up on the other side of the hill (Portola/Bayview). It’s so CLEAN in here with so much character and detail. The barista was so nice! I’ll be back!
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"One of the best americanos I've ever had, the quality of the coffee they serve is superb. The staff is great, the ambiance is very cool, good art, skateboard photos and motorcycle stuff. What a great place, I wish I lived closer. Besides their amazing coffee they have delicious fresh pastries both sweet and savory, as well as an array of ube treats, and some cool merch, good quality place run by good quality people. 10 out of 10"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Great staff, great coffee, very friendly service and quick, great, modern neighbourhood vibe, owned by locals, nice interior design with art, I go here to get a quick espresso when I have an early morning shift"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Wife and I came in to grab a coffee and some food Sat, Jan 7. The line was very long, but place was obviously busy. We ordered 2 coffees, a pastry and a spam breakfast sandwich. The two coffees came out fine, the pastry was forgotten about until I had to go back and ask.  After 15-20 minutes, we assumed that they had forgotten our sandwich order as they asked us again what we had ordered and then created a new ticket for it and took it to the kitchen. We waited 10-15 for the new order and left the cafe, only to realize in the car that they had gotten the sandwich order completely wrong too.  Feels like the place needs to have an adult there. The whole time, the young employees were laughing so loudly to one another across the whole cafe, obnoxiously loud."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Excelsior Coffee is a great local San Francisco establishment. The staff was friendly and the cafe has a very modern and polished feel. I was recommended the horchata latte and was very impressed with it. Not too sweet but still had great flavor. I wish I lived nearby so I could visit regularly!
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,I really like the aesthetic inside with the motorcycle up in the back and even the treats that they brought in featuring ube from Oakland added to the overall list of offerings. The barista was super super helpful and patient with all my questions. I ended up getting an iced Americano and paired it with Anthony‘s cookies from the Mission. Perfect combination!
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"So glad I stopped in yesterday. Horchata Latte and an almond croissant. Nice treat to walk around the neighborhood with. Croissant was kind of expensive, but I care less about price since it's a local business. Go grab some coffee here and stroll around the Excelsior—sip and marvel at the variety of architecture that surrounds you. Awesome quarantine activity."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Strong coffee and interesting baked goods! Lot of ube flavor baked goods!
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Has my favorite blend ever: African Presence (AP). Trust me! Drink it black and enjoy the light chocolate notes and sweet aftertaste.  Update 06/24/2023: Indoor seating is now available! A big table in the back and two stools near the front door. Still great coffee on Mission. The area these days is a bit different, but don't let that stop you from coming in."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"The facility is nice, clean, and trendy. The coffee is good. However, the employees seem discontent or disengaged.  Employees reflect the management so maybe something's up in that department.  Owner just posted a childish remark. Therefore confirming speculations on how they treat their employees. The owner probably dips their hands in the tip jar also. Don't bother tipping as it probably won't go to the workers"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Excellent coffee. Smooth and flavorful. Cool vibe and friendly locals and staff.
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"I absolutely adore Excelsior coffee - the vibe is great, the coffee is delicious and there are always good treats to choose from (my kids are always talking about the ube brownies and rice krispy treats!). Plus they sell great merchandise, and organize community events. All the thumbs up for Excelsior coffee and their great crew, the neighborhood is lucky to have them"
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"One of my favorite coffee spots in SF. Great coffee always ready, delicious pastries, and always a bit of cool and eclectic art on the walls. Merch is pretty great too! Love this place."

Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"The more times I visit Excelsior Coffee the more impressed I am the by the consistent quality of the espresso. Drip coffee and cold brew are also great.

Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"What an amazing and finally a cool place to get a great cup of coffee in the neighborhood. I grew up in this area, and man did we need this hip little shop. Pastries are also fresh and delicious. And the staff is so welcoming and pleasant."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,A gem in Excelsior! Delicious pastries and BOMB coffee. Keep up the good work y’all!
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Tiny portions like ridiculously tiny. The employees also have a ""too cool for you"" attitude and made me feel like an unwelcomed burden to their time. Coffee was alright.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 and not one is because the coffee shop had very cool motorcycle aesthetic, as well as interesting art and things for sale."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,Rad coffee shop by some great folks. Really good coffee.
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Rapidly my favorite cafe in San Francisco. Great beans, fun/creative/random baked good selection. Really good design. Plus the motorcycle theme is rad. Weirdly impossible to find parking...but obviously not their fault."

They owners are locals, very mom and pop of the next generation vibe. They display lots of talented artist on their walls and sell a small and rotating collection of art and merch. Walk, ride, or drive over to check this place out."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"Purchased some coffee beans from Excelsior, and just before I realized ""hey, I didn't get my order yet"" I received an email from them, letting me know my package had bounced back to them. They asked me to confirm my shipping address (which means it was my mistake in the first place!), and assured me they'd roast some fresh beans before sending out my package again. The new fresh beans arrived super fast - and MAN is the Slow Jam Blend delicious. I'll be hitting Excelsior up again not only for their amazing customer service, but also to try out what other tasty beans they offer."
Excelsior Coffee,4495 Mission St,"I heard this place makes great coffee. So, I went today and got a cappuccino. It was delicious! Very good quality.
