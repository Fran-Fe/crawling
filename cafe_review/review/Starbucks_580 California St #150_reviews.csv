Clean store, drinks come up fast, and friendly Baristas who are always smiling and have great customer service skills, so checks all the boxes for an easy and familiar Starbucks experience for sure."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,Coffee is chain so it's extremely consistent between locations this nothing to complain about there. Most of the staff is very friendly
Starbucks,580 California St #150,Friendly barista.  Comfortable seating.
Starbucks,580 California St #150,Terrible service. The cashier would not let me order a Smores frappuccino even though it is clearly listed on their menu. She told me the only frappuccinos I could order are the ones in the picture to the right. Please remove the other 5 frappuccinos from the menu if they are not available.
Starbucks,580 California St #150,The Greatest Starbucks I Have Been To In San Francisco.... Friendly Place... CozY.....🐈‍⬛😷🌉
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Amazing staff, great location nearly remodeled"
Starbucks,580 California St #150,Friendly workers! Great coffee! Timely with the orders. One of the best locations!
Starbucks,580 California St #150,First time in San Fran for me and first Starbucks I patronized. The food took a little longer to come out than I'm used to back home but everything else was great as expected with the Starbucks brand.
Starbucks,580 California St #150,Spacious and modem looking establishment.  Very friendly staff.  Consistent product quality.
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"They did not give me what i asked for. I asked for a chocolate croissant and a grande mocha frap with cinnamon powder blended. The employees gave me a butter croissant while charging me for chocolate (even after i saw the wrong croissant go in the toaster and informed the employee that a correction needed to be made), they put too much chocolate syrup in the mocha (basically tasted like a chocolate syrup slushie), and the cinnamon powder was not blended. Very disappointed with my trip. Employees should get orders right and not overcharge customers for a mistake. I will not be returning here again."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"The Starbucks location on California and Kearny offers standard items, but the stand out of the store is customer service. The afternoon staff are super friendly even under noticable pressure from the long lines. The store has very interesting mugs and coffee items. The seating area is always full. This is the only negative I noticed."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Clean and bright! I needed to rush to the bathroom before ordering - bathrooms weren't locked, and no one batted an eye. Friendly and prompt employees."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"A week after closing the nearby Starbucks at Sansome and Halleck Alley, this Starbucks has to give out refunds to mobile order customers because they can’t keep up with demand.  Time to try Peet’s."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Great service, relaxed environment on the pier. A peaceful visually spectacular respite for a tired tourist and a great finish to a long workday waiting for the ferry home."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Ordered a small cappuccino and it’s the worst one I have ever drank. It’s the person who made it, she was busy talking to colleague and hardly did anything with milk, tasted raw cold milk , just threw it after a sip."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"It's an ok Starbucks. One half of food order was cold and needed to be reheated, several chairs had rips in them.  Coffee was fine."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,They closed an hour early. we were very Cold and needed warmth. Didn't happen shame on you Starbucks bad business practices.
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Kind of an odd and dark bathroom setup, (not a single light on had to use the little bit of natural light coming in from the large front window) but it was clean and fast service."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,Best Starbucks within a few blocks - super fast mobile ordering & really nice staff!
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"I never use Starbucks and I suggest that others do NOT either. Starbucks robs the workers by training their workers to have only Starbucks in mind and body. I could go on but this app doesn't have the space for it, here and now."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Great location, not enough seating though. Friendly staff. Parking would be difficult nearby."
Starbucks,580 California St #150,"Probably could use a bit more seating but spacious, clean and fully stocked at 4:30am.  Fast baristas"
