Le Petit Cafe,1 Maritime Plz # Grnd,"This is definitely a HIDDEN gem.  Located in 1 Maritime Plaza, I would recommend using the ground level building entrance on Clay between Battery & Davis. From there proceed past the escalators into a hallway. From there you can locate wayfinding signage that will lead you to the cafe!  I ordered the chicken salad club which came with bacon and avocado, offered through MealPal, and was satisfied with size and quality. Service was quick and there were no lines at 11:30. Definitely a solid, fairly priced sammy/salad joint in the FiDi."
Le Petit Cafe,1 Maritime Plz # Grnd,Fresh and delicious food with lovely service. Highly recommend this for a quick bite/grab and go breakfast burritos!
Le Petit Cafe,1 Maritime Plz # Grnd,"I'm spoiled they are in my building. Food made with local fresh of ingredients, and for the quality the prices better than anything in the area.  From the soups, to the salads (add some grilled salmon) to the sandwiches on the best bakery delivered breads (try the italian vegetarian on seeded wheat)  oh and the cookies and macaroons are too good. If they run out of cookies the sister store is down the hall and has a larger selection and the best breakfast burritos.  Yumm."
Le Petit Cafe,1 Maritime Plz # Grnd,I've used them a few times for catering service for my office. Food is great! Will continue ordering from them. Their breakfast burritos are fantastic. Yum!!
