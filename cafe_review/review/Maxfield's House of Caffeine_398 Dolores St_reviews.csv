Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,This place is an amazingly nice place to have a cup of coffee. Located a block away from Dolores park yet its atmosphere is very relaxing.. you can sit outside and enjoy your coffee or tea and watch people go by. I personally prefer to sit inside by the window and read a book.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,I love this spot. Annie and Tiffany and crew are excellent. They know my order and cater to a host of neighborhood regulars. Great space to work during the week- large tables great overall vibe. Don’t try to get in on the weekend though. This is top of list for my midweek work spaces.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"So disappointing. I think they gave up. I went in the past week. I was hoping to get a drink and sandwich and sit inside to do some work. The cafe was empty and there were two employees working.  When I walked up to the counter it took the two lady’s a few minutes to greet me. They seemed to busy talking with each other and doing tasks. Once I was able to order I asked if I could sit inside. They said “NO, ONLY OUTSIDE”. Not sure why the rudeness and yelling. I understand we’re in the final stages of a pandemic. But this cafe is huge. They could space out tables 12’ apart and still they could fit 20 people. Not to mention the doors and windows are always open for airflow. I’d expect this 6 months ago, but nit now. I ended up sitting outside for a couple hours. During that time I think 2 people went in, and one didn’t buy anything.  My cold brew coffee was bitter. I’d guess based on how busy they are it’s a few weeks old.  They are also closing now at 3pm. Why so early??? Perhaps if they followed the city rules they could stay open later, pay the bills, and bring this place back to life.  I think the owners have given up, so should you. There are better coffee shops in the area."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"You can get coffee but not good coffee. You cannot see the origin, and the coffee is dark roast. The space is nice and large, quiet enough to sit and work."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"A lovely and comfortable neighborhood coffee shop. They have a great selection of breakfast items - I got a veggie turnover and it was delicious. It's also rather inexpensive. They also have your standard selection of pastries, cakes, and power bars. I will also try to check out their smoothies one day; looked delicious. The staff was fun and witty. Good wifi and many power outlets. They don't mind you working for extended periods of time, as long as you order something every now and then - not difficult, anyone will find something they like. There are also many other people working. As a point for improvement, it would be great if they also provided drinking water. Sipping coffee all morning, I need some water to mellow it down."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Please, if you are a POC they will treat you differently! It was my first time being there and I was thinking about purchasing something after the workers change my mind. I got there with another person we sat down and we were talking minding our business. The worker came from behind  came and asked us if we were going to order and if not we had to leave. (it got me for surprise that they even asked.) I kindly told them no and after I asked why they told us bc we weren’t giving them our business and that we were being rude mind. All the workers started to attack us yelling that we were the rude ones and that we had to leave (we were only the POC).  I understand that it’s a business and they want to make some money which is fine but they need to watch out on how they treat and speak to their clients. Second of all it’s a coffee shop I thought we were allow to walk in and sit down and talk and if we wanted to order something we still can or not. Third, it’s not the first time they do this kind of behavior I have talked to other people around the area and they have told me that the workers are rude. I have read some of the reviews we’re they tend to treat clients poorly and asked them if they are going to buy something if not they get kicked out."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Had a very enjoyable avocado sandwich and Vietnamese coffee to go from this place. The sandwich was well made, maybe just with a touch too much mustard. There is a relatively large seating space, with both table and sofa seating. The atmosphere was very quiet, as most people there seemed to be working. I saw a free WiFi sticker."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Enjoyed an afternoon here! Lived the fresh juice
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Love this place! Deliciously strong Vietnamese coffee and homemade gluten free bar 🤗
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,The club sandwich is a must-try. It’s just a standard club but they do everything right. I would die for this sandwich.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Great cozy spot! Blt hit the spot. Coffee was made with love
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Wonderful place. Open, airy interior that always offers a peaceful place for work or conversation.  No loud music or other unwelcome din.  Staff are nice, efficient, and hard-working.  Beverages and comestibles alike are good quality and reasonably priced."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,sad that whoever  commented back about having a bad experience as a person of color the owner instead gave them attitude and sent them a link of proper order etiquette unprofessional
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,someone working behind the counter sneezed into their hand (no gloves). rinsed off briefly with no soap.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Here is great place for take a break  relax yourself or with friends and family  get a cup of coffee & tea or other drinks; sandwich and the baked food, barista are very nice, coffee and foods are very good"
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Lovely neighborhood café with reasonable prices and friendly staff.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"An old-fashioned American coffeehouse with a homey atmosphere. The coffee and food are decent, and prices are good. A great place to stop and rest as you explore the city!"
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,They discriminate if you don't look white. Think twice before supporting this business.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Great spot to chill, read a book, or have a lowkey catch up"
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Nice, casual neighborhood café.  Coffee is good, food is fair, atmosphere is comfortable and funky.  The Asian family who run the place are super-friendly and fun. It's so nice to have so many independent cafes around."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,The coffee is decent and decently priced (thank you!) But the pastries could use work. I tried and tried again and haven't really liked any of them. Shame. They look great in the case! But they suffer from all kinda tasting the same and being overly fluffy without any density to them. Worth 2 bucks but not the 3+ they're commanding.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Great coffee shop if you want wifi! Comfortable seating options, nice and sunny, I love their fresh squeezed orange juice and yummy gluten free cookies! There's also quite a few tables outside to enjoy a warm sunny day!"
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"First place I went to, randomly, when I visited SF. The atmosphere is really nice and it's in the very middle of the mission and Castro, right next to Dolores park. The coffee is good and so is the decoration. Music is chill and plenty of people get there to work on their computer or hang out. The staff are super friendly and they gave me great pieces of advice on what to do, where to go etc. They even helped me looking it up on there phone!"
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"I like this place. The coffee is tasty, the atmosphere relaxed. It does get a bit loud but to be expected at a place this busy. There is a lot of seating and many food options if you're hungry."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Staff was extremely rude and complaining loudly about their lives from behind the counter. Atmosphere is cold. Coffee is generic. So many lovelier coffee shops nearby with charming ambiance, and warm staff and ambiance. Avoid this place."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Great low key local cafe. Yummy sandwiches, and sweets."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"With the sad demise of H cafe, we were in need of a new local hang-out cafe. I remember Max's being kinda divey, but it's a great, comfortable cafe now - the kind in which you want to relax and spend a few weekend hours just reading. Our new weekend home away from home. Everything they serve is good and not so precious that it requires a second mortgage."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Charming little Neighborhood Place. It was hopping when I was there. Also tables on the outside is nice. But my cappuccino was so bitter I threw it away. Now I'm down the street writing this review at the Ritual on Valencia. The Maxfield's score cute little place to hang out!
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,If I didn't Absolutely LOVE This Place...I would not have worked Here for the last 18 Years. 😘😁 …
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"I love this little coffee shop!  Great local spot, the coffee isn’t pretentious.  The inside is very cute, too- lots of natural light. Great spot for working or to grab a coffee to go."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"A great hide-away, a block from Dolores Park. Get a coffee, capiccino, or other cold drinks on a hot summer day. People needing a place to get some work done, or to drop out to take a quiet break this is your spot. Bagel sandwiches, proggies, cookies or fresh fruit, the food is good and not all dressed up to impress. Art on the wall and peace and quiet makes this place special. Out door tables let you sit back and people watch which on a Saturday can be hours of fun."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Wendy and the crew are absolutely amazing. Delicious coffee. Wonderful atmosphere. Fabulous time.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Very nice atmosphere and the lemon butter cookies are amazing but at the time there was contraction going on outside of the building so it was a little bit noiser then I would have liked. But overall a nice place for a cup of joe.
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"I'm giving this cafe a 5 star rating primarily because their brewed coffee is amazing- the cafe is comfortable, with outdoor seating as well as varied seating indoors- the staff is always super friendly."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"Needed coffee and food and wasn't dissapointed. Coffee is nice, not strong enough for an Aussie but OK, and the hot turkey is delicious. My favourite. Staff is excellentl."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,"For the record, if they had 0 stars I’d choose it instead. I had been here a few times before, nothing special about this cafe but be prepared to defend yourself from the nasty staff if you don’t buy something immediately. I had planned to get something to eat but sat down to answer an email, literally a minute later, the nosy Asian counter woman asked if I had planned to buy anything!? Who does this?! I proceeded to school her on etiquette, but you can’t reason with ghetto mentality which is the case here when you have to solicit your patrons. Never going back."
Maxfield's House of Caffeine,398 Dolores St,Locally owned coffee house we visit at least once or twice on every trip to San Francisco.  Staff is amazingly friendly. Steven is our favorite Barista
