Javalencia,1594 Market St,"I had the Cesar Chicken Salad, fruit cup and cold brew ice coffee. Everything was very fresh. The staff was very friendly and there was a nice atmosphere."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,My bagels have been decent. I think they could have more veggies. But the coffee is great. Affordable and great taste. Not burnt or pretentious. The inside is very elaborately decorated for a small cafe.
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"This really is a nice spot to get coffee. This location truly deserved higher reviews than five stars. Everything about them was first-rate, including the services, interior decor, and staff. a location where one can return often for more. Everyone should visit this coffee store, in my opinion."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"I don't know what I would do without this fabulous coffeeshop and sandwich spot on Market at Franklin. Always great coffee. Splurged with a Mocha this morning. Had a tuna sandwich; mostly available first half of week; iffy later in week. But their wraps are very tasty and the Cubano is quite filling. They have made these last two years very survivable-- thank you so much Marta and Wendy, you are and serve awesomeness."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"I love their breakfast sandwiches with spicy Tijuana cream cheese! For lunch, would highly recommend their Cubano. The food is great and the staff even better! Highly recommend stopping by."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,Very friendly morning staff! They have one of those manually operated espresso machines where they pull the espresso shots themselves and I absolutely love it. Good sandwiches. Nice atmosphere. Overall it’s a great place for morning coffee and a quick lunch.
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"Delicious Almond Croissants, Fresh yummy Bear Claws, and one of the best Fruit and Yogurt cups I have tasted. I slipped in after 3PM, and I did not have a clue they were technically closed. The (pretty) lady who assisted me was very nice, personable, and super helpful. That was my first visit and I am going back again now."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"Lovely place with great coffee.... don't go in the morning or if you're in a hurry. It is SLOW! Takes forever to get served here. I remember Cafe Trieste across the street. They were great too, but also so slow.... they're not there anymore. I like the place,  but only when i have all the time in the world..."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"Ordered a mug of coffee and slice of carrot cake to eat inside. The coffee was horrible, tasted like it had been heating in the pot for a long time, tasted burned and unpleasant. I had to ask the barista if he was planning on making fresh coffee soon, which he did. No paying customer should ever be given coffee that is as old as I was given. The barista should keep track of that. Also, when I asked for a fork for the cake, I was given a small plastic fork- really? All in all, not a pleasant indoor experience."
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"The stuff is friendly and fast, the menus is clean but with good verity, I had the matcha shake with no sugar which was just what I needed. The croissant sandwich also yummy"
Javalencia,1594 Market St,"Javalencia makes the most perfect and delicious, scrumptious, delectable Cuban sandwich. I have been to Little Havana, Calle Ocho in Miami for the authentic Cuban sandwich. Javalencia does it precisely the exact same way. Panini pressed bread with thin slices of ham, pork shoulder, swiss cheese and pickles. If I were blindfolded I would think I was in Little Havana. I visit Javalencia every week. Bob"
