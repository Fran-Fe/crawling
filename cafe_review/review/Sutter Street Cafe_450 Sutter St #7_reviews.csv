Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Delicious and an absolute gem! I had an incredible breakfast and we went back to get sandwiches to go. This is by far the best place we've eaten at so far in San Fran. It's a hidden gem, you need to enter a large building and follow signs for the deli. Service was awesome."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,I wandered in here because I was staying in the Marriott next door and happened to see on Google Maps that a cafe next door had good reviews and reasonable prices—and that it was hidden away inside a Wells Fargo parking garage. I wanted an affordable pastry and good coffee and got exactly what I wanted. I might go back because every sandwich on the menu including the breakfast croissant looks so amazing. Access thru the Wells Fargo parking garage or ATM lobby and look for a subtle overhead sign reading “Sutter Street Cafe.”
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,This spot is so quaint.  A small little deli in the city but small town hospitality.  The guy that runs it is hard working and very nice and polite.  Although being small the variety of food and snacks available leave you wanting for nothing.  Husband had southwestern sandwich he absolutely loved and I had the cheeseburger without a bun. The patty was so flavorful well seasoned. Definitely our new lunch spot when we hit the city. Gets a little busy but wait is not too long but worth whatever time you have to spend there.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"We got the roast beef special and blue cheese with prosciutto and they were both delicious! We were visiting as we sat and waited we could see all the regulars that come in and how the person behind the counter knew all of them by name! The sandwiches were amazing, definitely local spot with great friendly service!"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,I go to a dentist in this building. For years I would stop at Starbuck's on the corner before my morning appts.. But since they took out the seats I figure they don't need my business. I found a better experience and service at Sutter Street Cafe. Nice owners who accommodated my special order of a bagel with avocado and tomato. No issues and smiles. It was also nice to hear the friendly conversations they had with regulars and new comers like me.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Hidden gem, came here for breakfast the 2 days I was in San Francisco. Lovely staff, fantastic and warm with the children. Alot of options, sandwiches and bagel being their specialty. The Reuben and the smoked salmon bagel were both fantastic, like really good."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Really good sandwiches! I ordered the pastrami salami combo sandwich and I loved it. The bread was really soft and warm and everything tasted fresh! Easy to find if you read the reviews about it being inside the parking garage :)
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Nice little joint for a quick lunch or coffee. Seating is mostly available, and the staff is super attentive and friendly. Also, pricing is very reasonable as well."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Gluten-free tuna melt was good. Jasmine tea ginger ale was damn good. Gluten-free halvah was good, too.  Good good good. (Also, my top score is always four. I rarely give a five.)"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,This is the best deli/cafe in San Francisco and anyone can fight me on that. The sandwiches are so good and the quality of food is top notch and reasonably priced. I love taking the time to just relax and enjoy my sandwich. The staff is incredibly sweet and so hospitable especially Joe! I always look forward to getting my usual there.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"We LOVE this place. Literally a hole in the wall inside the parking garage at Wells Fargo, we almost missed it. The service is warm and friendly and the food (all day breakfast or lunch) was delicious!"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Joe and staff were awesome in making 10-15 sandwiches each day during our conference when we needed them. They were so accommodating and helpful. In addition, their sandwiches tasted great and are filling (typically a half sandwich would feed each person). We ordered the chicken, roast beef and turkey cran sandwiches."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Just had a quick tasty munch 😋. We'll indeed return . I love Great espresso ☕ in ceramic or glass cup which they did have. We'll indeed return when in the Great Area.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Good ambiance, very friendly and polite staff, terrific food and very satisfying!"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"HOLY HECK this place makes good sandwiches. you will not be disappointed. & it’s so *niche* (but legitimately hard to find you need to GO IN the parking garage). i got a build-your-own pastrami, with everything but lettuce/arugula, on dutch crunch. feel free to copy that order it was heaven.  YUM, over & out."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Direct entrance is at the entryway of the parking garage. A few small tables available inside.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Shout out to the reviewer that pointed out the entrance to the Cafe is IN THE GARAGE if you are coming from the street.  I ducked in here for a quick takeout lunch and had an absolutely delightful sandwich (Sutter St Special) and couldn't resist a piece of chocolate and almond coated halwah that was just perfectly salted.  The people working here are super sweet and there's an eclectic and unique assortment of snacks - including lots of different bottled and canned drinks and a freezer of ice cream in a bunch of different flavors.  Love this place!
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Like so many people, my dentist is in this building. And so was my previous dentist. 450 Suffer, am I right? For years I've said to myself, ""man, whatever they're toasting in there smells good"" as I got in line for the elevator. But then I'd go to the dentist and either forget all about it or be feeling the aftereffects of a treatment as I left. Today, I finally went to the deli on my way home and it turns out an 11 am dentist appointment was a great idea. This deli is excellent! The sandwich I bought was made exactly to order and tasted exactly right. I'll be back at every check-up."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Great little shop with tasty affordable sandwiches using some high end ingredients. Forget the subways all around and come here for a bite to eat.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,The staff was so kind and polite! I must stop when walking around San Fran.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Don't let the fact that you have to go through the lobby of the building intimidate from checking this place out! Great little breakfast spot with terrific food and very friendly staff. There is room to dine in, yet might not be able to fit the whole volleyball team."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Great sandwich and tasty. I got the pastrami/salami combo. The soup and sandwich were very good.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Hidden gem in San Francisco. Best breakfast in the area.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"friendly service, delicious, high-quality sandwiches. Try the Sutter Street Special or Sutter Street Combo."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"I only bought a soda, but the sandwich selection looked very good. Nice decor and ambiance. Friendly staff."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Good food, but very little seating. Also the Yelp page gives you the wrong address and it's not easy to find. Walk into 450 Sutter Street and follow the ""deli"" sign. Overall good food and coffee and decent portions for a reasonable price. No refills on coffee though unfortunately."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Pretty nice for a casual bite and breakfast. But it's hard to find the entrance. it's located near the parking lot of 450 Sutter Bdg.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"A cross between a convenience store and a cafe, this is a great place to grab a yummy, reasonably priced quick meal. Had egg and bacon on a croissant- excellent!"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Excellent little cafe. Had a cappuccino and some sandwiches, loved every bit. Highly recommend."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Had a breakfast sandwich and croissant. Both were very good. Breakfast sandwich came with a hash brown and coffee.
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Whoops - just realized I had reviewed this place thinking it was Sutter Cafe (the one known for its tamales in the Stockton Garage), but now that I've actually visited, I have an entirely different point of view! My bad, sorry Sutter Street Cafe!  I'm a fan of this place. Cheap, solid breakfast option in the Union Square area. Stopped in for an omelet, which I think only cost $6 for lots of veggies, cheese, and sausage, and got a hash brown and coffee for free! The omelet was a bit greasy, but with my raging hangover that morning, that's exactly what I was going for.  I rarely buy breakfast, but when I need something to pick me up in the morning, I'll definitely be coming back here."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Fantastic sandwiches (loved the prosciutto on Sutter Street special), great coffee and nice staff. It's a bit hidden inside the building, just go inside the lobby and then to the right. Love this place."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Located in the lobby level of the 450 Sutter building, this litte cafe is easy to miss but the food and prices can't be beat. All day breakfast and their sandwiches, especially the Tuna Melt and Southwestern are to die for!"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Tasty food! We ordered Vegan and Black Bean gourmet sandwiches. Very sweet and polite staff.

Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,This is a hidden gem in the parking garage on Sutter street. The sandwiches here are UNBELIEVABLE! I had the same one two days in a row and am still salivating. Must visit if you’re in Downtown SFO. Must eat: black bean veggie sandwich!
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"“Sutter St Special” sandwich served here is superb, with prosciutto deliciously complemented in taste and texture by the other ingredients. Does espresso too."

Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"One thing in advance: the café is a bit hidden, you have to go from the street to the main entrance at number 450.  This is a large office building and then after the mailboxes on the right in the direction of the underground car park is the café.  Apparently also popular with locals, it is very crowded in the morning, which speaks for the quality. We liked it. Everything fresh and prepared by hand. There are also smoothies"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Hidden in the Sutter Building by the garage entrance. Everything is freshly prepared, the coffee tastes great and everyone is super friendly. Absolute recommendation. Yummy 😋"
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Somehow we must have overlooked the entrance or it no longer exists. No idea 🤷‍♀️
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,"Café inside the building. My food was not worth the money and the venue not the best for eating out. My daughter liked her Christian sandwich, she adds."
Sutter Street Cafe,450 Sutter St #7,Delicious pastrami sandwich.
