The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,A homey little hole in the wall. Staff are always friendly and the mochas are tasty. Great muffins!
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Loved the artsy, cozy ambience from the eye-catching artwork on the walls to the welcoming workers. Perfect place to grab a coffee and get some work done! Sandwiches and bagels were warm and toasty.. yum!"
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"This place is so wonderful; where do I begin.  First off, I’ve never been here before now and I already know I will be coming back. The atmosphere is very relaxed and chill. The food is great and so is the coffee; I highly suggest getting their laté.  The owners older dog is so sweet, as is the great guy running this cafe.  Overall, it’s a super great small business and worth visiting."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,Amazing people behind the counter. We had blue berry muffins (were good) and Chai Latte (which we repeated - that amazing)
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Really unique atmosphere. Books for the curious. Great coffee. Excellent cookies, and natural food, biscuit, croissants and other drinks are desirability delicious. Enjoy the outside tables and company with close limited seats. Check it out."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Speaking of magic. I felt safe and super happy today here. A feeling I haven't had for 36 months. Coffee is good and affordable, ample tables and chairs, plenty of things to eat, serene meditative music, plants, art, a small dog, good books and magazines, internet is fast and unlimited, customes are mellow and kind, toilet is clean, your brain feels smooth, owner is there with 10 years of experience. This is a well designed coffee store. Got a do some work, bring your laptop here. You'll get it done. Feeling stressed or worried, you'll be chill, safe, and loved. What a coffee store. I came out after 2 hours and gravity feels half. The outside seating is like a vacation.. I'm so grateful that my friend took me there. It was like going to a coffee store in Japan. I was there on Friday and it was chill. Give it a try. You'll start to wonder if you need a therapist. Even of you are far from here, take a ride to here. It's worth it."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,The egg and cheese asiago cheese bagel with bacon and avocado was divine. Cozy atmosphere.
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,The barista was very nice but the entire interaction/transaction was very strange. He took a couples order then told me it'll be a few mins while he works on their order. He then comes back to the counter with the finished food and the couple gets up and I have to move out of the way because they hadn't paid yet. He then takes my order and doesn't take payment and says it will be like 10mins so I go sit at a table outside. He comes out and says my stuff is almost ready if I want to come in and pay now. He hands me a drink with syrup settled at the bottom so I start swirling my drink to mix it myself. He says sorry we don't stir drinks when it's busy.....so I say interesting...The whole thing was just....weird....also the turkey meat looks hella sus.
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,One of the little bits of life in San Francisco that feels good to have been part of every time you leave. It’s cozy and the coffee is great and the food is good and it’s welcoming and let’s you breathe and it doesn’t feel conceptual.... it’s not performing at being a cafe. Its not fancy or tiled or driftwood decorated..... it is a lovely little cafe with lovely people. We randomly had an analog conversation with folks sitting across from us and the owner joined in and it felt so nice to just build for a moment with one another with no agenda or screens. I really want this city to stay accessible for folks who want to connect and live their lives outside the tech space. I love this little spot. 💝
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"I have no idea why this place has 4.8 stars. Coffee just ok, bathroom quite unsanitary, death metal blaring the whole time. Nice barista though."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"This is a quintessential neighborhood cafe! Their plan isn’t to raise funding to build 25 new stores by the end of the year, and to sell their souls in the process. Their prices are right; the folks are great; and the vibe is spot on. I used to work from home (which also meant that I worked a lot from this cafe) and now that I have a go-in kinda gig, I take advantage of every chance possible to hang out at this little gem of a cafe. Keep doing what you do, Ken, Chris, and Daniel! Also thanks for giving the Mission a real down to earth cafe experience with any of the pretense."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"This place is definitely old San Francisco. I have been going here for years to meet with friends and read and often bring my young daughter to play board games. The food is good and they even have Japanese shaved ice and Halo Halo! Lots of plants, artwork, books and movies... they play an artists variety of music and once in awhile movies! The staff and KitKat the dog are my favorite."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Love the coffee, love the staff. Good vibes."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"The cafe is super cool and fun. They have classic rock cassette tapes, random art, anime comic books, and a bunch of other funky decorations.  I'm not a fan of the coffee. I would not go here for the coffee, but I would go for the ambiance"
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,Its a really cool eclectic coffee shop with a great vibe and great coffee. Its not corporate coffee. If you want that you can get it anywhere.
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Such a cute cafe, I found it across from the post office but it's clearly a local staple. The breakfast bagel is delicious and the cappuccino is foamy.  Honestly, the best part is the homey feel with the comfortable chairs and kooky knick knacks.  I came on a Tuesday afternoon and it was fairly empty - customers trickling in and out for coffee and bagel sandwiches. It has free WiFi too, so I was able to get some work done."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Literally a little spot on the corner. Cozy environment, great drinks and good vibes"
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Good coffee, friendly service, very cozy and comfy place. They have board games, it feels like home"
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,The cafe is so cute! The barista is super chill and nice. Theres a cute blind dog there and a great collection of books and manga.
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,Visiting the city but the friend I’m staying with had a big meeting (he works remote) so I had to get lost for a few hours. Was able to chill here and have a great breakfast. I recommend it. ☺️
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Cozy, unpretentious little place that looks out on a sunny intersection. Truly reasonable prices, good playlists, staff who keep it real.  Solid coffee, fresh sandwiches and bagels.  My go-to for wifi work or to meet a friend.  The tiny shop dog is as chill as dogs get - never intrusive, silent as a stone, just an adorable kindred presence.  Bonus: punk rock living room deco includes a bookshelf of National Geographics and... NSFW Japanese anime."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,I love coming here every morning for my usual coffee and breakfast bagel. This is a place where you'll see regulars who are friendly and share conversation with you. Chris runs the place and he's great.

The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Really friendly staff, manga lining the walls and a really cute dog owned by the boss. The croissants are as big as your head and the coffee is good."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,Most chill café I can find in 10 block radius. Even their tiny dog is relaxed. Have you ever seen a Chihuahua in public that was calm and slow and relaxed? Chill little spot.
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Charming out-of-the-way spot.  Very uncrowded (at least on the day I visited).  Cashier/barista was friendly and helpful, and my cappuccino was tasty and generously sized."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,The best.  Ken the owner has created something special here.  Love the coffee too (and the lox bagel).  Chris who works here is awesome.
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,"Not sure why this place is so highly rated. Coffee to go was terrible, milk was scalding hot and there were strange unidentifiable bits in the coffee at the end (not grounds)?! Haven’t had such a bad cuppa in ages. Disappointing."
The Little Spot Cafe,1199 S Van Ness Ave,Quirky little coffee shop in neighborhood. I can’t speak for any of the food but the staff is SUPER friendly and they use frozen coffee ice cubes for their ice coffee so it doesn’t dilute as it melts!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏼 …
