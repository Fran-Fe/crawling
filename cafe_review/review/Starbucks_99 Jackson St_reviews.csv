Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"It might be because I’m from out of town but this is UNACCEPTABLE. I ordered the largest size as to share between 4 people. The cup isn’t even full. Staff had a DISGUSTING attitude. Except for Erika, only nice one."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"This Starbucks has to be the worst of them all in San Francisco. I live very close to this location and I used to come out frequently until I realize that they never have any consistent barista‘s or coffee maker workers. Just recently they made my drink wrong. I ask for a different drink & the barista had a really nasty attitude, accompanied with her colleague telling me to get out of the store. They also told me I could not get my money back. One of the girls name is serenity, and the other one is a short, fair skin, big eyed girl look like she’s from a different planet."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Located at nice Area at gateway across Safeway.  Greeted warmly when entered.  Only issue that they didn’t meet my expectation is because published at Google that they close at 6pm, but the chairs outside are removed by 5:30pm. Therefore you don’t have seatings. All the indoor tables are blocked from being used, likely due to Covid.  If too cold outside, and expecting to be indoors, it won’t be possible."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Unfriendly service, no toilets, cups half full, bad internet, no power plugs, dirty tables - definitely nothing you would expect from Starbucks!"
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,Good place for coffee only. Not great place to study because very few usable outlets for computer. But lots of places to sit down and read or drink coffee.
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,One thing is blue berry color and other is MOLD inside and on top of the scone... now I understand why the majority of people don't like Starbucks anymore 😑 there's nothing fresh about its food like they advertise. …
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"I was here on a Sunday afternoon in the COVID times in NOVEMBER. Service is average. The drink taste is same as most other stores. I order a venti (large) mint mocha and got a grande (medium) instead. I got charged for a grande so I did not complain ( good thing I ask for my receipt as this is not the first time at a starbucks) Store is clean and tidy. Three staff on board during my visit. I almost trip on a wet floor sign as it was a slight rainy afternoon. In doing so I knock over another sign. I wanted to pick it up and did so for one of the sign but one staff member prevented me to do so for the other. The staff team member said it will be done and 15 mins later. While trying to enjoy my drink. I had to go back in the store for a cup of hot water as visitors are not allowed to sit in, the same sign is still on the floor when I re-entered. I am a gold member. There was no one in line and I politely ask for a cup of hot water at the drink pick up area. But the was other people waiting for their drinks. I was told that I will not be charged because I had bought a drink. The drink was not hot enough and too sugary for my taste that was my reason for the hot water. I ask for a tall size cup of hot water and got a venti size. This place is crazy. I may not dress like the norm or was my hair in a tidy business manner but this place should not do this to a well mannered paying customer for over 6 years. Starbucks get it together. I don't expect a red carpet treatment. Just be clear and fair. I live a commoner peasant life. Geez."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,I should have taken the time to drive to a local coffee shop. Girl at the register was nice but the girl making the drinks had an attitude with everyone. I think it's funny that people think they can get away with treating other people badly. The atmosphere is nice except for that loud beeping that Starbucks seems to think is tolerable for humans to endure. Only worth it because it was the closest source of nourishment for me.
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,Coffee was good but cup half full.
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Usually good service and atmosphere. They forgot to make my drink one time and didn't offer a free one like other Starbucks have done in the past. Otherwise, a nice place to drop by in the mornings."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"A nice Starbucks. Bright, clean, not to noisy. Nice staff. There can be a bit of a homeless issue here, but it's minor compared to other local Starbucks. It's my favorite downtown Starbucks."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,I love Starbucks. Mango dragonfruit refresher is my favorite.  Friendly staff and very clean. ❤❤❤❤❤
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"These people for some reason do NOT ever want you to use their restroom. The service is terrible and the staff for the most part, depending on what time you are there, because not all of them are this way, but the majority of them are, they tend to want to close very early and shut down the restroom when you want to use it. Every time you go in there, when you guy, you have to get a code from them, but they just seem to be out of codes all the time and their response is, ""Sorry, it's locked."" So, no apology here; I don't go to this location any longer. POOR, POOR, POOR service. They do not care about the customer."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Excellent service. Barista didn't measure out my breve (heavy cream) latte correctly, the cup was an inch shy of full. But she fixed it immediately."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Great location. If you are visiting SF, you can grab your coffee and keep going to travel downtown so easily. Polite staff. Only the problem sometimes is parking. Thanks."
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,This Starbucks is open and allows you to enter and order drinks and food but the staff will not allow you to use the restroom.   The gal said the bathroom is not open to public and refused use even though I just spent $30.  I guess the staff did not want to spend little effort to clean the restroom.   Poor excuse of the current epidemic for poor service  Other businesses allow their restroom to be used
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,Well maintained and good customer service 😃 …
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Only 2 people working. A male on the cash register and a girl preparing. When the blender stopped, she noticed me watching her. Instead of putting it in the plastic cup she put a couple more pump from those ingredients then put it back in the blender again. She put a lot of caramel and lots of Whipcream that is overflowing. It's a hot day and kind a busy day for them. She looked exhausted already. BTW this is the most horrible Caramel Frapuccino...EVER"
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,Bad customer service one of the ladies is very rude and if you order the pour in coffee she makes you wait for long time on purpose..if you people don't want to work why being in a place with that attitude and with a face of disgust. Seriously I hope someone could pay attention to some of the members of the morning crew
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,Busy place. Nice people. Odd Fung Shui. Feels like an intersection due to the narrow walkway and dual entrances. Only 1 restroom. Not too much seating. It's very basic.
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,Before I head into the office I get oatmeal and an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich or the Spinach Feta Cheese Wrap. Good Wifi! Calm atmosphere and AMAZING MUSIC!! I always ask Siri to name that song their playing.

Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"Some of the employees in this place are a bit bad at serving they ignore people even when the order is already ready, they also prepare the wrong coffees and with very little enthusiasm they don't know how to treat customers they have a very bad attitude I feel sad Because it is one of the places where I go the most from my house now I will have to go to another place to avoid this type of service pay attention to the service I am not lying to you"
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"I ordered Chai Latte and asked whether it contained sugar.  I was told ""NO"".  It, however, contained lot of sugar.  I am glad I did not put additional sugar.  I AM DIABETIC!"
Starbucks,99 Jackson St,"It was a regular Starbucks.  Service was a little slow, but they were training a new person.  The staff attitude and friendlyness more than made up for the slow service."
