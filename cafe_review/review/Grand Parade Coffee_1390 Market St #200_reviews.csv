Grand Parade Coffee,1390 Market St #200,"I have been a passionate coffee customer ever since I can remember, however I wasn’t knowledgeable about coffee’s economic global impact, the impact on the farmers growing the coffee, sustainability of the environment and how the quality of coffee can differ until l had the opportunity to encounter Grand Parade Coffee. The quality of Grand Parade is simply delightful, I savor my daily morning cup of coffee with joy knowing the money I have invested in my coffee not only generates quality coffee but also gives back the farmers a better-quality life, supporting the local community with economic means and patronage from Grand Parade coffee. Now when I drink my coffee every morning I am happy to experience excellence in each flavor the company offers and feel humbled to be able to make a difference in the lives of local farmers in different countries with merely one cup of coffee a day.  Thank you Grand Parade for your altruistic vision and for providing an opportunity for customers like me to be of service while taking pleasure in first class-coffee. Anosha Zereh"
