Chuck Williams Cafe,1101 Van Ness Ave,"Cafeteria style cafe with a very spacious contemporary ambience. There are different types of food offered. Burgers and Asian food (with different theme from time to time: pho, Chinese stirred fried, etc.) are customized and made to order. Self-service salad, soups, and ready-to-go sandwiches are available as well. Price generally under $10. Very nice place to enjoy the street view through the floor-to-ceiling windows on the 2nd floor. You will see lots of hospital personnel in their uniforms eating here."
